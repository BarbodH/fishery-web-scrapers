For walleye fishing, Simonhouse narrows can be really good. Athapapaskow had good lake trout and pike fishing. You shouldn't have any trouble catching fish up there."
6299886,outdoorsron,2019-03-14 16:31:00,843,Hello: My friend invited me to go to Lake Athapapascow [ don't know if the spelling is correct ] in Northern Manitoba the first week in June. Neither of us have fished Manitoba before . Anybody ever fish this Lake ? Any advice for this lake ? I have fished in Ontario a lot. I was told in Manitoba you have to use barbless hooks. In Ontario you need a nonresident license and an Outdoors card. What do I need for Manitoba ? Can I buy barbless jigs and lures in Manitoba ? Is it legal to pinch the barbs closed or do I have io replace the hooks with barbless hooks ? Anything else I should know. Any information greatly appreciated. Thank You. Good Luck this season .

6299902,fldoc1,2019-03-14 17:18:00,69,"Every few years we have driven to and fished Cedar Lake (grand rapids, Manitoba) which is 270 miles north of Winnipeg. Saskatchewan River dammed up. Area has a limestone base and we have always had good northern fishing. Find the cabbage typically in bay like areas or inside corners in 8-15 fow (sand on the shore is a good place to look for the cabbage) Yes, you need barbless hooks and they can be bent down. My go to lure is the Williams gold/silver. The 5 of diamonds, the Johnson silver spoon (can add trailer), and the doctor spoons are my favorites. Since fishing for northerns with the barbless hooks I also use them in Ontario and Minnesota and like the ease of releasing the fish and do not feel I have lost more fish than those that use trebles. Walleyes are plentiful also and we look for current areas to jig, in the evening (we don't get up early) pulling worm harnesses around points that have deep water nearby, plus pulling hot-in-tots / stick baits over structure. Cedar is huge but we only fish one end so large but not unmanageable. Still there are windy days that are hard to get out so we head to the Saskatchewan River and catch all the walleyes we want. Bottom bouncers mostly with worms. A huge dam is just upriver from Grand Rapids so fish from the dam down to Lake Winnipeg. Fish from the lake have beautiful green backs. I do not know anything about the lake you are going to but suspect fairly similar fishing to Cedar Lake. Randy from Duluth"

Since you will be there in early June and if you are lucky enough to be there soon after the ice goes out it is possible the big northerns and walleyes will be concentrated in special bays. (ice piled up on the shore of islands) In Cedar there is one bay that runs in a few miles ending in a creek / small river that runs in form other lakes. We typically fished the second week of June and only hit the jackpot once. I do not know anything about the lake you are going to but suspect fairly similar fishing to Cedar Lake. We are all retired now and Cedar is a long way from Duluth so seldom fish it anymore. I wish I lived closer. Randy from Duluth"
6299916,Larry S,2019-03-14 17:42:00,665,A great source of Manitoba fishing is extremesportfishing.com The board monitor guides in Manitoba and will answer any question you might have about the fishing & lakes in Manitoba Have a Great Trip!!
6299946,Honkerslayer,2019-03-14 18:52:00,238,Where are you from? We fish near there and know a little about the area.
6300060,Honkerslayer,2019-03-15 05:36:00,238,"Never mind, I see you’re from Iowa, not that it matters! It’s a good lake trout lake and gets a fair amount of pressure from locals but you are going at the right time. Trout will still be shallow over rocks. Fish weedy shallow bays for walleye and pike. There are other better lakes in the area though IMO."
6301966,Angler1700,2019-03-20 09:59:00,37,"Welcome to Friendly Manitoba!Here is the online form if you want to buy your non resident licence in advance. It's for the 2018 year so it's old, but I'm sure the process is the same. Keep in mind you don't need to buy the licence ahead of time and you can purchase at many places when you arrive in Manitoba.https://www.gov.mb.ca/sd/wildlife/hu...pplication.pdfMost recent fishing guide is below. 2019 isn't out yet, but rules are generally the same. It talks about barbless hooks, limits, etc. Review it. You'll need to look up the lake and figure out what region it's in. When the new guide comes out review that and take note of any changes that could affect the lakes you intend to fish. https://www.gov.mb.ca/waterstewardsh...ling_guide.pdfAny hooks you have in the water need to have pinched barbs. Anything in your tackle box doesn't need to be pinched until it's attached to your line. Give it a good squeeze with your plier after you tie your hook on. Can't comment on the lake, but best of luck."
6302020,fldoc1,2019-03-20 13:40:00,69,angler 71 is correct about only needing to bend down hooks in the water. I will add that my regular fishing pliers were not great at bending barbs on larger lures so I take a heavy duty pliers and they work great. Good luck.Randy from Duluth
6302102,Bill Krejca,2019-03-20 16:05:00,6107,"I have found when fishing Manitoba that forgetting to pinch down the barb(s) after changing baits can happen fairly easy, as it is a somewhat unnatural muscle memory, if you will, from the normal fishing pattern process. It has happened to me several times, jis sayin'. Bill"
6302792,uplander1,2019-03-22 07:02:00,1,"We fish the Cranberry chain, which is right across hwy 10, the first week of June. You can crimp the barbs on your hooks and it is not an issue. You will get a conservation license, I believe. Haven't read the new regs, but you have historically had to throw back walleye over 19 1/2, trout over 25 1/2 and pike over 29 1/2. In terms of lures/bait, it has varied from year-to-year. Last year, we hammered walleyes on slow death and bouncers. The pike were slow due to water temp. The year prior, caught a lot of walleye on shad raps, number 5's I believe. The one constant seems to be a mepps #5 in red/white or a #4. This will catch both walleye and pike. The daredevil spoons also are good. We have caught trout on the kastmaster spoons in blue/silver and mepps in the blue as well. We haven't done a lot of jig fishing. We did have a guy dragging a jig last year and he did well with it. You can't use live bait. We've tried frozen minnows in the past, but have had better luck with a worm or gulp. Watch out for rocks and enjoy your trip. What lodge are you staying at?"
