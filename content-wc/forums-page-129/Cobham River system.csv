6311214,SWM08,2019-04-14 19:43:00,10,We will be heading to the Cobham River system through Amik outposts the last week of August and staying at their Cobham Morley cabin. Has anyone been on that system lately that is willing to share their experience? We will be fishing for both walleye and pike and hoping to find good numbers of both! Thanks.

Lots of water to explore. Some of the best walleye fishing was just around the corner from the Morley cabin, but there were fish everywhere you thought there should be. We didn't target pike much, but caught a few on walleye rigs. John will mark a couple midlake humps for you but be sure to bring a depthfinder to locate them. Relax, you will find fish."

There wasn't anybody in the Morley cabin so we cruised up that way from the Daniel cabin for a day to try the spots they had found earlier that summer. Here are the spots I marked on my GPS. Lil Hump N52.85941 W094.58869 This is a small hump that produced some good fish. Morley N52.850856 W094.601046 this is down by the dock at that cabin. Tom's Point N52.85968 W094.58061 This is a point that one of the guys there in July caught a 25"" walleye. We caught a few but nothing that big. Tongue N52.84123 W094.64666 So named for a mark on the rock wall that looked like the Rolling Stones logo. Spent a lot of time letting the wind blow us a hundred yards then motoring back up and floating over the area again. Caught lots of good fish there. I had a great time up there. It was only my second trip north. Those guys found the fish I just marked the spots on my hand held Garmin. They are letting me tag along to Vee lake this year. Hopefully TR won't make me carry extra rocks in my pockets like he did last year. I'm not sure but I think he was trying to make me too heavy to float in the life jacket."

The first time was 1997 and we were on Headwaters lake which is next to the arm that the Morley cabin is located. We portaged into that arm but didn't fish all that much. We caught a few walleyes and did a shore lunch but then headed back to our cabin. Can't wait to spend a whole week on that system. Thanks again!! I have read that the Cobham is known for trophy pike, can we expect decent numbers as well? It sounds like you guys are mostly after walleye! Anybody else have experience with the Cobham pike fishing?"
