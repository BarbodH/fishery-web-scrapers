6311454,Pasha Lake,2019-04-15 09:52:00,3,Okay - I guess I have to frame it a different way - I heard of a place that would fit the description you are looking for. PM me and ill give you details
6311522,Juls,2019-04-15 12:53:00,13414,"You do not have the ""frame it another way"", because the information was solicited from the OP. If you had just come on a thread and advertised your place without being asked for the information it would have been deemed advertising. Also, you didn't add a link to your website, so you're good. No worries...."
6311598,TitanD,2019-04-15 17:28:00,43,"Nighthawk Lake would be great for small party. My wife and I stayed there many, many years ago and very good fishing lake that could be navigated in most all conditions. Viking Outpost used to have it but not sure who runs now.......maybe just different ownership. Not sure about going to any outpost camp alone. Just is not safe IMO! If u do go it alone take extra precautions in everything you do! Good luckPS, maybe you should look for a few other like minded guys looking to make a trip??? Just a thought"
6311758,madnomad,2019-04-16 06:16:00,34,"why isnt it safe?ive spent 3 weeks in the bush with nothing,but a knife and a 7 foot piece of wire....and i do have a dog. i personally like the danger element"
6311986,TitanD,2019-04-16 18:06:00,43,Sound like a dang ninja warrior or something!!!
6310796,madnomad,2019-04-13 09:41:00,34,"id like to plan a trip for mid-late august,within 10 hours from TO and under 1k...drive in, fly in or boat in,i dont care...and i actually prefer more rustic camps(reminds me of my family hunt camp as a kid)im interested in mostly walleye,but i like fishing all freshwater species i cn...another bonus would be some portage lake to try out..it will be just me and my dog,so pet friendly is a must,and id prefer some privacyi would also be into renting a private,rustic cabin with a boat and motor any suggestions would be very much appreciated,,, thank you"
6310820,adempsey2.0,2019-04-13 11:18:00,611,"Plenty of options within 10 hours. Price will be the main factor. Most posted rates for 2-4 people are ~$1200. However, given your trip is late summer you might find a willing outfitter, especially if you have some flexibility. If they can fit you in between pickup/dropoff flights you could be golden.I would contact the following outfitters:Air Cochrane out of CochraneAir Ivanhoe out of Foleyet (fly-in and boat-in)Red Pine Lodge out of Foleyet (fly-in and boat-in)Hearst Air out of HearstAir Dale out of Wawa (1-807-355-3903)Hawk Air out of Hawk AirCanadian Airventures out of ChapleauHenderson's Outposts out of ChapleauBuck and Bingwood out of HornepayneJohnston's Fly-In Outposts out of HornepayneWhite River Air out of White RiverWishin' You Were Fishin' out of TemagamiFive Mile Lake Lodge out of Chapleau has two boat-in outposts."
6310822,madnomad,2019-04-13 11:35:00,34,"wow,thanks s much for all those links!appreciated"
6310826,madnomad,2019-04-13 11:53:00,34,"i contacted a few,see what happens"
6310832,adempsey2.0,2019-04-13 12:17:00,611,No problem. Hope it works out for ya!
6310846,Namegosikaa,2019-04-13 13:13:00,61,"There is also good time outfitters out of Cochrane that have four drive or fly in camps your choice, upper Kat and burntbush are decent sized lakes the other two I'm not familiar with. Mid August with a dog may be expensive for a fly in so this may be a more economical option with a fly in feel."
6310874,adempsey2.0,2019-04-13 16:07:00,611,I always wondered what happened to those Polar Bear Outfitters camps. Never heard of this outfitter. Good to learn about them!
6310926,RichA$1970,2019-04-13 21:11:00,1159,Great timing as my crew will have to cancel due to a terminal illness in their family and I am back on my own. Our outfitter will roll the deposit to next year which is cool but I am now going solo so I will keep tabs on your post.
6311352,madnomad,2019-04-15 07:18:00,34,"ive been looking at sasseginaga outpost in quebec,$800 for 1 at an outpost...also Bush Country Camp"
6311452,Pasha Lake,2019-04-15 09:48:00,3,"madnomad - we have exactly what your looking for with access to GREAT walleye fishing - Rustic cabin, off grid yet GREAT fishing with alternative lakes in addition to the one you're on PM me - ill give you details"
