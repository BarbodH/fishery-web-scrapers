6310850,1100 Remington Man,2019-04-13 13:25:00,73,I personally like when people leave Beer and Liquor. Yes several times I have opened up a fridge with Beer.
6309504,That Minnesota guy,2019-04-09 20:11:00,8293,Can't be real hard to ask the camp operators how they want things handled and then do what they say.
6309534,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2019-04-09 21:41:00,240,"Hi--our outfitter (Nestor Falls Outposts) requires a $150 cleaning deposit. You get your deposit back if the incoming fishermen initial/sign off on the condition of the outpost upon arrival. Each group is expected to police the grounds, clean and rinse the boats, mop the floors, empty the fridge, etc., and this policy assures that each group has pretty much a very, very clean camp upon arrival. This system works great. There is nothing worse than discovering the woodstove did duty as a garbage incinerator during the past week. And I can only imagine the kind of stories the camp operators could relate if they wanted to start a thread on that topic."
6309580,ogilville,2019-04-10 06:38:00,262,Unopened beer?
6309606,jambi,2019-04-10 08:08:00,504,We leave toilet paper.
6309624,Aspencreek,2019-04-10 08:35:00,2911,"Yup, I am usually the last one out the door, and I am a Makers Mark or Weisers guy. So yes I will leave any unopened beer in the fridge for the next group...it's the least I could do."
6309632,bushead11,2019-04-10 08:52:00,151,Our outfitter comes to our outpost cabin to pick us up at 6:00am on the saturday we leave. It ensures that guests are out on time to make sure he can turn the cabin over but also a way for him to ensure that the cabin is clean. We usually have a feast on friday night trying to eat all the perishable items we can. Cleaning is way more fun after 2-3 bourbons... We have a box of items that we typically haul back and forth with unused items. I think there is a can of corn in there from 2003.
6309726,KSjim,2019-04-10 13:09:00,88,"We had some good trips with NFO but never appreciated their deposit refund policy. As a small business owner that deals with problems 51 weeks a year the last thing I wanted to do ( or was going to do) right after getting off the plane at a remote wilderness outpost is become the ""deposit refund police"". If NFO used a third party fly-in service their policy might make sense. But they fly their own planes with pilots that are their employees. Let the pilot make the call, no NFO always told us it is the incoming groups responsibility."
6310448,MrSimon,2019-04-12 06:48:00,922,"This thread confirms what I've always believed .... there are two types of guys that enjoy fishing in Canada.Respectful anglers who follow rules, are considerate to other folks, and treat people decent. This is by far the type we have on this forum.Jerks. Guys who leave trash everywhere, break rules, disrespect others, try to screw the outfitter, and generally give US guests a bad name. Fortunately there aren't many on this site, but unfortunately there are a bunch out there. We've all run across them."
6310474,Baseline,2019-04-12 07:27:00,3207,My group is going to bring our own stuff in and carry it out. I'm leaving whatever is in the cabin when I get there. If I need room in the refrigerator I bag up the garbage and burn it or leave it for the resort owner.
6310608,Aspencreek,2019-04-12 13:03:00,2911,"Let me add a third: The guys that will complain about how filthy and disgusting the cabin was upon their arrival but do nothing about it, and then go online and on posts like this one to complain about the way they found the cabin only to leave it in even worse condition because the WILL NOT clean up after anyone else or themselves."
6308620,olderfart,2019-04-07 11:47:00,18,"This is kind of a takeoff of another thread about burning plastics, etc. At least as far as our group goes, nobody wants your 1/2 loaf of 10 day old bread, or a 'fridge full of half used mayo, catsup, butter, etc. Several times we have filled a trash bag full of stuff before we could start putting our own stuff away. We should all try to leave the camp like we would like it to be when we arrive. Some things like charcoal, plastic wrap, etc. OK but perishables are to us no good."
6308636,SimonHockey04,2019-04-07 12:48:00,25,All we leave behind for the next guests are our left over nightcrawlers. We never burn our garbage
6308642,Jpat,2019-04-07 13:05:00,10,"I totally agree. If I checked into a hotel room and found leftover food, I wouldn’t eat it. Why would it be different at an outpost or camp? I think this problem stems from the fact that people don’t want to feel wasteful especially with food so people “leave it for the next group to use”. If food is brought in and not used, toss it or take it back home. They don’t weigh your gear on the return flight anyway. Also make note of unused food and use that info to dial in your grocery list for next year. Also Nobody wants a bag of someone else’s trash sitting around the cabin for a week."
6308688,KSjim,2019-04-07 16:46:00,88,Over the years we have left less and less. We now leave nothing. If we don't use it we take it out. We offer anything unopened and unused to the pilot for his use or to donate to the local food bank.
6308692,Pooch,2019-04-07 17:13:00,4618,"We stopped going to a fly in camp because they never policed the outgoing groups. Last time we were there the group had just left when we discovered the fridge completely full of old food and filthy. Wood burner was stuffed full of un-burnt garbage. We spent a couple hours cleaning the cabin before we could even use it or the fridge.Even though we told the owners about it, nothing was ever done to fix the problem. We are not complainer's by any means, but it was getting worse every year so we just went elsewhere. We voted with our money.Appears it's a common problem for camp owners and clients. Some groups are just uncaring and disrespectful of others property.Pooch"
6308774,Aspencreek,2019-04-07 21:46:00,2911,"Interesting thread, when we leave camp in CA the only things we may leave behind is our nightcrawlers, leeches, and whatever unopened beer, mustard, chips, cheese, etc. BUT, when we do our 2 short trips to South Dakota to chase Pheasants, the fridge is sometimes full of 1/2 bottles of ketchup, salad dressing, oil, mayo, etc. And sometimes it is appreciated, those short (4 nights) trips are hard to plan for as far as groceries. The difference is we are in a farm house in SD, and during the season the turnover is pretty quick, with our group leaving and the next group showing up in a couple hours and the landlady just doing some vacuuming, changing sheets, towels, restocking the TP and general cleanup. That place has more spices than a Penzey, and enough aluminum foil and plastic bags to last the season, but it's nice to know you won't run out."
6308850,camp chef,2019-04-08 06:46:00,915,"On our drive in camps we always ask the camp manager or owner if they want any of the left overs. Most always they keep and appreciate the aged wisconsin cheese, extra liquor or beer,dish soap,etc."
6308852,CI_Guy,2019-04-08 06:51:00,2118,"One of my sons worked at a LOW resort for one summer. They had boat in camps but no fly in sites. When they cleaned a cabin all that they were supposed to leave were disposable salt & pepper shakers, unopened water bottles, liquid soap and plastic wrap, zip locs or aluminum foil.He was amazed at the number of people that thought they were doing the next group a ""favor"" by leaving leftover casseroles and other food. I don't always trust food brought by some friends, so I can't wrap my mind around eating food left by strangers."
6308896,Bill Krejca,2019-04-08 08:09:00,6107,"Some camps have different methods of getting ready for the next party, part of which includes cabin cleaning. A number of them hire ""Saturday morning help"", if you will, to come in and clean a dozen or so cabins. It has been my thought that the folks employed are probably not among the wealthiest in the area, and probably make good use of whatever leftover food that seems safe to consume. Fly-in camps may be a bit different, in leftover food disposable. I have never had an owner complain about good stuff which was left, even when we discussed the subject. This does mean being a slob and leaving casserole items and food laden plates that need to be disposed of, things of this nature need be cleaned up by the leaving party. Bill"
6309474,Aspencreek,2019-04-09 19:10:00,2911,"I am guilty of not being more specific....we dispose or pack out all leftovers and opened food stuffs, we will leave condiments, unopened packages of food (frozen items, eggs, Lil Debbies, etc) This past year the guys before us left us 2 large bags of O'Brien potatoes and a dozen eggs. Thank you very much! Breakfast anyone."
