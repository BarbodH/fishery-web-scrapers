I premade about 50 dropshots on a pool noodle before leaving home. I made them out 12# mono with varying lengths. I made a few of each 10,12,14,18 inches from the weight(3/4oz). It outfished jigs when the fish were really biting. I had the best luck tipping the hooks with minnows but I even caught a few on plastics which for me was an accomplishment."
6311908,kettyspanky,2019-04-16 13:56:00,271,I've never seen or heard of it before. I googled it and it seems easy. I'll give it a try in a few weeks in northern Wisconsin for the opener. Thanks
6311910,mikear,2019-04-16 14:04:00,436,Good episode by The Next Bite guys: https://youtu.be/4aQaaPQsDTYPlan on trying this and the Ned Rig this year for walleye and saugeye.

However, we used bait like minnows or crawlers.I have tried it for walleye with finesse plastics and it does work. Is it better than jigging? Not really, just different. Might be good in certain situations though. For example, anytime you need to fish deeper water it should really shine. I would like to try it for Lakers at some point. Just never got around to it yet."
6311960,Scratcher,2019-04-16 16:57:00,170,"Google Wolf River Rig. Hang two hooks on the line and it's a Perch Rig. All really variations of the same concept. Anchor the line with the bait off the bottom. It's also done with two small hair jigs for the White Bass run. Hook the first one, leave it swim a bit and he catches a buddy. It's a blast."

For some reason with a plastic they leave it alone most of the time so I have a chance at walleyes. Seems like about 12 to 15 inches off the bottom works for me."
