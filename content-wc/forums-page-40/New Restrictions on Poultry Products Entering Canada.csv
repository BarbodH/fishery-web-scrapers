6653400,Laketripper,2022-05-03 11:02:00,103,I'm thinking that donation bucket will not be overflowing considering the kerfuffel created by being forced to purchase poultry products and bait in Canada.

Is that considered bringing Poultry over the border ? Because you and me both know "" you aint holding them wings very long"" &#x1f923;"
6653452,SweetD,2022-05-03 14:14:00,243,"Hold on, I thought we established Canada had chickens…….do they only have laying hens so the reason for the border crossing for wings????

6653456,Eckohlt,2022-05-03 14:19:00,3685,They call grouse chickens so yes they do have plenty chickens.

I been making the trip for over 20 years, and have never experienced anything but the utmost courtesy and professionalism. I'm pushing 70, and got my 4 pokes so I'm good to go.

6653330,N_of_Quibell,2022-05-03 07:58:00,151,"Good point. LOL. Years ago, when my wife was along, the Customs folks ""tossed"" our pickup.

For instance, at the border crossing the patrol can ask what direction/road we are traveling, and then inform us of an opportunity to make a road repair and maintenance donation. Put up one of those displays that shows how much has been collected. I include MN roads as well, loaded w travelers just passing through the state on the way to or from Canada. I know I'd happily kick in some dough as I'm sure many would."

Yes, I was concerned when I first saw this post but was relieved to find out that, yes, the Ontario’ins actually have laying hens and will have eggs available in local grocery stores!

6653064,Walleye2242,2022-05-02 06:56:00,263,a 6 page thread on eggs. JUST BUY YOUR EGGS IN CANADA FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!!!!
6653126,NM_Trout,2022-05-02 09:47:00,1094,"My host is Canadian born (so I am assuming Canadian or dual), and he employs Canadians. We pay $1500 (yes, USD) per person, so $6000 per week. Add in $200+ for bait, $400+ for hotel rooms on either side of the trip, fuel (as you pointed out), licenses and outdoor cards, Canadian beer, $300 for misc restaurants also before and after, then throw in t-shirts, mugs, tourist crap that we bring back home as small gifts. This doesn't include whatever fees gets paid to the Winnipeg airport on the 50% of trips we take that we fly in there. On those trips we also buy all our groceries in Canada and rent our cars there as well. So it's going to come to a little bit more than a tank of gas. Just a little bit. It's worth every penny, but having another ridiculous regulation imposed is just another cut in the death by a thousand. We bring freeze dried eggs as it is a lot easier/convenient and less weight to do so, and now that is out. My patience with all things government-mandated is at an all time low. We support as many of the small businesses that we can in Red Lake. That has to be a tough place to make a living the last two years.I'm not alone in being annoyed with nonsense legislation. Can't bring preserved baits, have to show vaccine cards (proof of recent infection isn't adequate because... well...legislation, not science), and now additional restrictions on the ability to bring in convenience food items. If someone could tell me how USDA approved poultry items is more of a risk than wild birds flying across the border, I'll quit my whining."

A few dozen eggs or chicken wings sure the **** are not going to keep us from our trip North this year! The outfitters, bait shop owners, beer shop keepers and the many others in Ontario we come in contact could not be any nicer and welcoming! Always have looked at it as a blessing that they share their beautiful country with others and always welcome us with open arms eggs or no eggs!!!! &#x1f60e;"

6652912,Walleye2242,2022-05-01 16:55:00,263,"I always buy my eggs up there anyway. I do not bring any poultry. I have no problem with whatever the border rules are. I will follow them and enjoy the beauty, fishing and the fine people of Canada for the 10 days I get the privilege of being in there country for a bit."
6652914,Wawajake,2022-05-01 17:04:00,413,Thankyou for your respectful attitude and I hope you have a great 10 days and have many more great memories to share with your family and friends.
6652986,dschiebel,2022-05-02 00:31:00,85,"I once knew a girl from Des Moines, Iowa that could swallow a dozen eggs without breaking the shell. She wasn't a real looker, weighed about 450ish, 6 felony dwi, ,oh well way to much work for a dozen eggs. But if she could swallow 40 dozen salted shiners, she have a place in my boat."
6652998,kettyspanky,2022-05-02 04:20:00,271,"I guess if bait and eggs are the only things I have to worry about, I'll be fine. There is a general store about a mile from our resort anyway. We ordered our crawlers ahead of time last year and picked them up on our way threw. I'll just add 2 dozen eggs to the order and be good to go."
6653000,btyreprich,2022-05-02 04:38:00,1067,"Would it be ok to say buy the eggs here in the states and bring them into Canada not in the shell buy in a frozen zip lock bag? We used to do this when egg prices were as low as $0.60 a dozen in the Chicago area years ago. The frozen eggs were easier to transport, and you never had to worry about them breaking on the drive up. Just asking."
6653008,kettyspanky,2022-05-02 05:29:00,271,In my opinion anything poultry isn't worth the hassle. You know they are going to ask you if you have anything poultry when your in line at the border. I have chickens at home that lay eggs. I love pickled eggs. I can buy some up there and make pickled eggs our first night there. They will be good to eat in a day or two. In my opinion it's not worth the hassle.
6653026,pjshorthorn,2022-05-02 06:01:00,5654,It has always been that way for any banned products including bait. PjShorthorn
6653036,Eckohlt,2022-05-02 06:21:00,3685,Sounds to me like you would need a much bigger boat with her along.
6653058,kettyspanky,2022-05-02 06:45:00,271,I saw that last year when we were in line. A border officer was going truck to truck asking about bait. We saw a truck get out of line and go back across the bridge. I asked the officer when he came back threw and he said they sent the guy back to minnesota to discard his illegal bait. That's why I say anything to do with poultry is not worth trying to cross with. It's way easier to get the eggs when I get there than to be turned around at the border. Good luck to all.
6652828,Eckohlt,2022-05-01 13:10:00,3685,"Just have to wait n see what's next,dont you like surprises cheeks??"
6652830,Wawajake,2022-05-01 13:11:00,413,"and I remember when I could cross into Sault Michigan to go bowling with just my drivers license and not need a passport. I remember when , our potatoes were allowed in the USA, I remember when my daughter went to University in Sault Michigan and drove back and forth every day without delays......I remember a simpler time , and then 911 happened in addition to diseases in beef and poultry and potatoes, etc etc. Both countries are doing what they think is best to mitigate the risks with the things they can control somewhat.

BTW, the US is no better on this than Canada... we too prohibit importation of agricultural products. Lotta good that does. For Immediate Release : Canada declares no American air may be brought over the border due to overwhelming risks of airborne contamination. All Americans must exhale prior to crossing the border, and deflate tires. Service stations selling overpriced and overtaxed (fair wages, dontcha know) Canadian air, worms, potatoes and eggs immediately available upon entrance. P.S. I checked with my outfitter. He said that he stands firmly on the side of Canadian policy, but as long as that means he can winter in Arizona and have access to the Mayo clinic for healthcare, he LOVES the sound of my whining as long as I bring stacks of US cash with me to enable his south of the 49th parallel endeavors."
6652844,Laketripper,2022-05-01 13:29:00,103,Tourist dollars? Do you mean the one tank of gas you might be forced to purchase in Canada for the vehicle you are renting in the U.S.A which will be chock full of all your goodies you loaded up with before entering Canada. You are most likely supporting an American owned tourist camp operator which was probably paid for in the U.S.A. because that's what your types do. Being the gracious Canadian I am I will offer you this advice. Consider topping up tank in Prawda Manitoba. It's usuallly 10 to 15 Cents / litre cheaper there than in NWO.

Canadian government should require avian flu tests of all the geese that vacation down here in the states during the winter. But, of course, much like produce and bait, forcing us to purchase eggs and poultry products up there only helps (microscopically) their bottom line. Perhaps we should charge the Canadian government for all the free chow their geese dine on down here, or implement a goose poop tax.
