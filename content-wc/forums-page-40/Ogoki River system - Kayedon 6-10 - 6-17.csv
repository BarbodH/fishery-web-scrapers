He was home when his father passed on 6/11 - RIP. Friday am, we had perfect weather for the fly in. I knew the Ogoki was high about 4 feet higher than the highest of our prior 4 trips. Fishing was incredible with 2 pike over 40 on day one alone. Fishing spots changed which in some ways is welcoming. High water shuttered other camps along the Ogoki last week. We were lucky. Sat an Sunday welcomed us with mid 30's temps and heavy breeze. Camp wood stove put to use. One day at lunch it was still 43 with windy conditions. Fishing remained great. We leave camp early after quick coffee, granola bars, pan cakes/oatmeal at 630 fish till noon-one pm have a big lunch, nap, play cards an then go out again 230-3 ish fishing until hungry typically 8pm ish. Mon or Tuesday weather stabilized, blue bird, no breeze, 80 degrees and bugs got buggy. Fishing declined but dozens caught per day rather than hundreds per 5 guys during our best days. Weds morning weather was perfect we were still exploring and fished a channel couple miles East of camp. We found another honey hole with lots of walleyes averaging 18-19 occasional fish up to 23. Wednesday afternoon my partner for the day and I fished a new spot i had discovered late in the day on Tuesday. We caught a 100 fish approximately 35 pike and 70+ walleye including the best walleye yet a 23.5 in a current area just below flooded timber. Spot does not exist in regular water levels. Friday morning 1-2 am ish the wind started howling over 50 knots. We were scheduled to fly out at 7am. Wind died down a little at 430pm and sure enough the Otter landed to bring in one group and depart with our group. Wind came up with plane attached to the dock only to snap off from the mooring. 20 by 20 dock with plane headed towards the trees with plane attached. Pilot quickly untied and removed plane from the situation. We shuttled men an gear to the plane via small boat. Just another story to the collection of outdoor experiences. Great trip, lots of moose, a bear, 2 fox, mink, over a 1000 fish caught with 4 big pike."
