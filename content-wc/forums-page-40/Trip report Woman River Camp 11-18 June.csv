His 5th trip to the Canada bush.Drive up and back was uneventful. Slid through the border at 6PM Friday with no wait and back through at 1PM Saturday and maybe 3 car wait. Standard questions and no hassles. We did go through an Ontario Conservation Officer checkpoint on the way out of camp. Very polite officers, showed them licenses, answered a few questions, showed them our fish, they took a look at contents of truck and sent us on our way. Took all of about 5-10 minutes.The detour is still in affect. Talking to lodge they were told at least 2 more weeks. As for trying to slide through it there were construction vehicles parked on both ends and you would have to do some creative maneuvering to slide through. The detour added 10 minutes according to google maps. Heard mention about bridge repairs on the detour and it was open both times I went though with no workers. They were adding and grading gravel in various places during the week from talking to the camp. Could see the fresh gravel on the way back.First of all WRC has great cabins and boats. We chose to upgrade to a G3 with a 50HP and bow mount as have used that combo of boat on other trips and wow they are great to fish out of. Plenty of stability so when people get moving around in the boat not having to worry about anything. We checked out the other boats, they have various upgrade options and all looked clean and taken care of. We were fortunate that we ended up in the newest cabin. Very nice setup and everything was clean and functional. Having been to places that different little things don't work you appreciate when things do. Each cabin has a gas grill and fish fryer out on the patio. We toured some of the other cabins to get an idea in case of the future and all looked clean and setup nicely.Fishing was good to great all week. Paul set us up with a map of the place and marked it up for Northerns, Bass and Walleyes. Begining of the week fish were still in the channels but as the week progressed quality and quantity were dropping. Early in the week we had an evening spot in the middle of one channel that we caught them continuous but that spot was done by the end of the week. Looking back the best luck we had was shoreline structure that had timber and rocks. We lived in the 9-11 foot range all week. I do have autochart with the card so mapped a bunch of areas. I happened to have a depth band set at 8 foot and seemed right on the transition line of 9 foot was key in many areas.Tuesday we did the portage over to Spot Lake. Lights out Walleye fishing. Fished the side of the point and wind coming in had them going. Even with taking time off for a storm to pass by I bet we boated 75 walleyes. Quality was excellent too. Most were in the 17-19"" range. Think we had like 3 fish smaller all day. Several overs and too many double to count. Several times had 2 fish in the net together. Also had 2 instances of catching the same fish twice. Once we caught an eye that had our previous broken off line in its mouth, a little while later had a northern that had it too. Spent the afternoon casting for pike and while decent numbers no real size. Told the kid have had the opportunity to have some really good fishing days over time and this was probably in the top 10 for me.Wednesday we did SnakeWeed Lake. Fishing was consistent. Again found the fish along shoreline structure of the windy side of the lake. Coming off the previous day we caught fish in a spot for a bit that did some more exploring. Spent the afternoon casting for pike with one 35"" and a bunch smaller. Kept the kid busy. Ended the day stopping off at one of the spots fished earlier in the day and grabbed our dinner for the night. Great day trip.Thursday we got another good spot up in an area I would call the west arm of Bear Lake. North wind so fished that south shoreline. Pretty much sat on fish for 3-4 hours.Friday we just messed around with Bass and Pike close to camp. No great numbers on Bsss but had some quality.Fishing in the main lake system was good but the portage lakes was excellent. If/when we go back we may consider doing 3 or 4 days on the portage lakes. Not trying to say anything negative about the main lake but those other lakes were great.One group spent the day on Rosen lake and had great success. We ventured back there twice and caught fish but must not have had the secret sauce the other group had. Is about a 1 mile transit through the creek. Very scenic ride but have to idle with motor up as only 3 foot deep and lots of beaver timber to avoid. Catch it on the right day and could be great.WRC camp had designated shorelunch areas across the system. Loved this. Each is setup for easy boat access and has propane, cooker and table located there. He also has them on the portage lakes that allow fish to be taken. Spot is catch and release only.Overall well run camp with clean and functional equipment. Great people running the place and will take care of you while in camp.A sampling of pics for you. Took a couple videos that may post later too."

6665782,kettyspanky,2022-06-19 15:29:00,271,That's a great report. Glad to hear you had a good time. It's on my radar in the next few years.
6665944,HeHooksHimself,2022-06-20 08:16:00,725,"Good report. We have loved our trips to WRC. We have been there three times, once on the outpost. Paul is a great host and very helpful, we really like his style, no bs and he doesn't nickel and dime you. Pretty good fishing but we have had some slow times. All in all we have always had a great time there. Fish On! Hooks"

6666044,Old Timer,2022-06-20 15:23:00,255,Hi Valley. Although I've never been to Woman River your report took me back to similar trips when I also portaged into wonderful walleye lakes. I can identify with your entire trip and I'm sure other readers can do the same. Thanks for the terrific post and pics.
