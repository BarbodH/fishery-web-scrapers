6665806,GrayWood,2022-06-19 17:24:00,14,We are the new owners of Eddie North since late 2019. We are not simply investors and have made many upgrades to the camps over the last few years. Feel free to post or PM me if you need any info. Also google or Facebook search us. All the best!Adam WoodGray Wood Outfitters.

6666136,GrayWood,2022-06-20 21:02:00,14,"I agree the weather has been less than desirable this spring in most of northern Ontario. From high water to cooler temps to big storms. Mother Nature is not in a good mood. In saying that the fishing has been great. I would not say the norm due to the weather but we have dozens of pictures of monster pike caught this spring, from all camps. 25 over 39‚Äù caught in Beteau Lake alone last week alone. The walleye as always has been great with the exception of opening week which was a very tough cold snowy week. If you ever want to chat or have me send you some pictures just let me know. All the best. Adam705-705-0522"

5713978,Mike Borger,2017-08-11 11:20:00,1554,From what I understand he sold the business this past spring.
5714074,wallydave,2017-08-11 12:04:00,2151,That explains why! What is the new name?.
5714170,Mike Borger,2017-08-11 13:08:00,1554,Eddie North LOL!Don't think anything's changed other than new owners.
5714394,wallydave,2017-08-11 16:00:00,2151,"The website looks the same! Just curious, there was quite a bit of controversy about the reports."
5714610,Mike Borger,2017-08-11 18:37:00,1554,Controversy? Really? I have no idea what you're talking about. Here's the only thing that matters. It remains a very interesting fishery with a very real possibility for trophy pike. Blackbirch (I think) was reopened this year and I'm really curious how it's fished. I'll bet it's been amazing.
5714626,wallydave,2017-08-11 18:41:00,2151,A trip up there just might be somewhere on the Bucket list!

5716906,onetimedave,2017-08-14 05:06:00,502,Heard the new owners are his investors.
5717594,tsquared,2017-08-14 11:58:00,57,"Is eddie still involved in the day to day? If anyone has been to any of the other lakes I would love to see a fishing report (feel free to post here or PM me). If anyone wants a report on Attawapiskat (i know there were plenty), feel free to PM me...."
