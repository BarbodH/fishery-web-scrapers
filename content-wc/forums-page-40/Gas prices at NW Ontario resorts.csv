6664706,Further North,2022-06-14 22:56:00,2008,Jeez.That sounds like bagged salad and cold Oscar Meyer hotdogs...
6665000,drlee,2022-06-15 14:19:00,409,Good one!
6665008,prov1800,2022-06-15 14:32:00,5010,Sounds bad.But don't forget a Canadian gallon is 4.5 litres as compared to a US gallon which is 3.78 litres.So you pay more but go farther.lol.Hope this makes you feel better.Nothing wrong wirh hotdogs eitger on a fire.
6663248,MikeAnkeny,2022-06-09 15:55:00,67,I thought the currency rate was 79. Is the price posted before HST.

6663434,eyecatcher1,2022-06-10 10:02:00,323,Are people filling up at resorts getting 87 Octane unleaded regular or the ethanol free gas that a lot of resorts use? I think that most of us use the ethanol free gas in our boats.
6663440,proguidedream,2022-06-10 10:28:00,345,"In Manitoba , even premium fuel 91 octane now has a sticker at the pump that says may contain ethonal... switched over this year . i am not completley sure if ontario is the same"
6663452,eyecatcher1,2022-06-10 11:24:00,323,"Here in Minnesota some places sell ethanol free premium. It's more expensive, but is good for old cars, motorcycles, outboard motors and other small engines. I used to use 87 octane unleaded, but when my powerhead blew a few years ago they told me to start using the good stuff."
6663520,Obabikon,2022-06-10 18:23:00,2370,"We're charging $2 US per liter.... so $2.54 CAN That price might have to go up though, as I just had a spike in my last fuel delivery."
6663640,skeet1,2022-06-11 12:01:00,53,Just returned from 2 week trip to NW Ontario. Cheapest gas was 2.06 in Thunder Bay. Most expensive was 2.28 in Marathon. Gas in Pickle Lake was 2.10. This was cheaper than Ignace which was 2.16 per liter.
6663752,Obabikon,2022-06-12 06:37:00,2370,"We buy and sell premium with no ethanol only. Our fuel service actually has to get it from the US, as most (if not all) Canadian sold gas has ethanol (even premium)."
6663770,v-bay gord,2022-06-12 08:00:00,3168,According to my supplier (Petro Canada) all gas delivered from Manitoba has ethanol....at one time premium did not. I use regular non ethanol gas which they get out of Thunder Bay.....not sure where it originates from though.
6663788,x4flatfish,2022-06-12 09:42:00,319,For you Canadians...does anyone know the alcohol content in your fuel? I was under the impression that it is less than 10%. Was told by a resort owner about 6% but I think he was guessing and had no idea...
6662376,Invader21,2022-06-07 06:08:00,105,"You know, I didn't really think about the exchange rate. So, good to point that out for the sake of the discussion, Lmbkiller.Except, my bill from the camp, from which I pulled these figures, was presented in USD, not CAD (I never cited which currency in my original post - just the cost per liter). And so, it IS $9.48/gal. Sad, but true. Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk"
6662378,prov1800,2022-06-07 06:16:00,5010,Normally if you stay at a camp that charges US dollars your going to pay in US for everything.Always been that way.When I travell to states my canadian money is useless.
6662382,Lmbkiller,2022-06-07 06:34:00,639,"That's quite the mark up if u ask me then. I went from ft francis to red lk same week as u and the highest I saw was $2.20/L cn currency. The camp I stayed at is only a few cents higher per liter than what was in town. I would question your camps mark up. To me gas is a service for guests, not something to have a giant markup on to make money off of. Even if said camp is a few miles out of the way"
6662398,Invader21,2022-06-07 07:11:00,105,"Perhaps so. It was premium octane. I honestly never looked or noticed what premium was going for at the pumps there. I was trying to get to camp and get back without stopping for (much) gas once there - due to the costs.Anyway - at the end of the day, I'm just trying to share what I paid at the camp - which is what the OP was querying about. At the end of the day, do I think it was expensive. YES. Would I do it to fish another week up there. ABSOLUTELY. Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk"
6662438,Wawajake,2022-06-07 08:34:00,413,"Gas price in Sault Ste Marie today is $2.16 Can, per litre for regular gas , premium is typically 10 or 15 cents more. So be careful not to be comparing perhaps premium gas at camps to regular gas in town."
6662466,ameoba,2022-06-07 09:41:00,105,$2.26 CDN per liter in Minaki right now (Winnipeg River - north of Kenora).
6662502,Lktrician,2022-06-07 11:52:00,32,"It's not fair to the outfitter that he pays for the increases in gas prices for your recreation. It's terrible that the price for gas is so high but the outfitters are in the business of providing you a safe,clean and pleasurable trip. Sticking them for the increase shows very little consideration or respect for what you are getting."
6662526,Yellowfin123,2022-06-07 12:50:00,2182,"i consider being able pull the boat up to a resort gas dock in the middle of nowhere a luxury, having to put the boat back on the trailor, go to town to fill up then put the boat back in the water a deal breaker.. whatever the cost is its just part of it"
6662680,Lmbkiller,2022-06-07 20:53:00,639,Not really sure what u mean by that. I bring my own boat. Resort owner has gas at dock (not sure how exist as a resort without that) he buys gas in bulk and pays for it. I need gas I pay him for it. The gas in his bulk tank doesn't increase in price just sitting in there. When he runs out he buys more at the current price and passes that along to his customers. With a tiny tiny markup. Not sure how I'm sticking him for a gas markup. The price he paid or pays is just that and it gets passed along
6663230,proguidedream,2022-06-09 14:22:00,345,"after todays conversion rates of .71 $2.50 a litre canadian , equals $7.51 a gallon USD $2.25 = $6.76 right now in Kenora it is $2.16 a litre for regular fuel (that probably has ethonal now ((thanks canada)) ) Average gas price was about $1.25/L pre pandemic , soooo your looking at almost double the cost your fuel normally is ."
6661938,Yellowfin123,2022-06-05 17:55:00,2182,"this sounds about right, the OP didn't ask what it was in downtown dryden but what it was at a far away dock in the middle of no where, 10.00 - 12.00 bucks a gallon sounds right.. and thats not gonna stop anybody but might stop a few from venturing to their special reef thats 20 miles away"
6661948,Prop Chopper,2022-06-05 18:53:00,18,6.20 us dollars per gallon as of last week.
6661956,Eyes_R_Us,2022-06-05 19:23:00,66,"I paid $48.25 US for 12.2 liters with tax last week at the resort I go to. (48.25/12.2) x 3.79 = 14.98/gallon. In previous years I noticed that the price per liter at camp is about the same as the price per gallon in the real world. Gas in International Falls was about $4.65/gallon so my rule of thumb is pretty close. In defense of the resort owner, he is about 7 miles down a dirt road so I don't imagine a gas truck goes down there for cheap. I always go with the boat tank full and a 5 gallon can. With careful execution I can make it through the week on that but sometimes I need just a little more on Friday."
6662080,Pooch,2022-06-06 09:56:00,4618,"Hoping that folks report what they are paying when buying fuel from the camp they are staying at and what camp. We buy fuel for our boats from the camp for safety reasons and are planning on just ponying up more for fuel this year, but don't want t get blindsided by it. Camp owners continue to take a hit when they furnish X number of gallons a week in the package price. Maybe not popular with us fisherman, but those camps need some kind of surcharge on camp fuel this year. As long as customers are aware of it before hand. Fly in camp operators? Yeow... Pooch"
6662086,v-bay gord,2022-06-06 10:08:00,3168,"I've notified my guests there will be a small fuel surcharge on my boat rental packages. So far it's been about $50 Cdn per boat / week ($75 if you spend your time driving around the lake). Some of my groups are still on 2020 rates which I have honored.....nobody seems to mind the xtra for gas. At my pump I'm charging $2.10 Cdn per liter for non-ethanol regular....which isn't much above my cost (this may change based on current fuel costs). Others need to charge more based on location. I've never tried to get rich on selling fuel. Based on some of the rates others are paying, maybe I should!"
6662100,Invader21,2022-06-06 10:41:00,105,"Week of 5/21 I paid $2.50/L at the dock of the camp I went to. That's $9.48/gal US. If you bake in HST, it was $2.83/L or $10.71/gal. Makes me shudder.But short of carrying enough gasoline in 5 gallon gas cans into Canada, what are we going to do? This was a large lake, so sadly, we burned quite a bit of gas, as well. It hurts - but you know what? If I could be up there again this week, I'd gladly pay it again!!! LOL Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk"

6661718,phishfearme,2022-06-05 06:30:00,1242,$2C per liter is about $6US per gallon
6661726,walleyecheek,2022-06-05 06:39:00,2231,I have to believe that fuel at the resorts are higher than in town. $2.10 liter in Fort Francis.
