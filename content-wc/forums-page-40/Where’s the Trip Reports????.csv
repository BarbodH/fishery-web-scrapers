6665856,Net_Man,2022-06-19 21:57:00,580,4601? What is the saying? All fishermen are liars except you an me and I am not so sure about you.
6665860,PRO-V16,2022-06-19 22:19:00,454,I don't doubt Echohlt. I've experienced that in our group on Lac Seul and Lost Lake by Hudson.
6665874,Eckohlt,2022-06-20 04:31:00,3685,"Actually The group didn't keep track of the number of fish we caught,but the number would be very high,wapesi lake is polluted with fish,it seems everyone is having a great fishing year so far,I'll be back at it in three n half weeks."
6666054,1shooter,2022-06-20 15:48:00,1493,Got back last friday from 5 days of fishing......the walleyes were on fire and larger than normal. All of them fat too. Water is extremely high. At the Marina most of the parking lot was under water.
6665754,SweetD,2022-06-19 11:49:00,243,Seen a couple but not much!!!
6665756,That Minnesota guy,2022-06-19 12:26:00,8293,"Fish just hop in the boat, every lake, every bait presentation."
6665762,walleyecheek,2022-06-19 13:09:00,2231,I think one group said they caught 4600 walleye........but who's counting........LOL !
6665764,Eckohlt,2022-06-19 13:56:00,3685,"Trip report wapesi lake,,,4601"
6665778,SweetD,2022-06-19 15:24:00,243,"Looks like none of you losers can break the 5,000 mark. Really sorta pathetic! If it were only 2 fisherman then maybe I can see it otherwise just sad &#x1f603;"
6665780,Eckohlt,2022-06-19 15:28:00,3685,"If I had one more hour to fish sweet,I could have made it."

6665830,BnD,2022-06-19 19:21:00,13,I'm gonna read this thread but first I need taller boots or a calculator?
6665832,Golden Eagle,2022-06-19 19:28:00,2642,"It's easier to keep track by weight. 1 ton. 1 1/2 ton. Walleyes hit on just about every drop of the jig last month, but I would have needed about 1500 to make a ton. Females had left the spawning area."
6665844,Kwhc,2022-06-19 20:25:00,4,My group just returned from gray wood outfitters Blackbirch lake. Flew out of nakina with nakina air. Phenomenal week of fishing. Honestly got tired of catching walleye by the end of it! &#x1f602; Iâ€™d say they averaged 18-20 inches our biggest was 26.Our group caught 9 pike over 36 inches. Biggest was 43 incher. Camp was really nice especially for how far north it is. The hot shower was a bonus! Saw moose and a big bear visited camp.I will definitely be going back.
