6666198,nitroman,2022-06-21 07:13:00,368,"We fish the east leg, a few damaged flicker shads and bent up hooks as walleye cranks are not made to hold a musky! I never get to attached to tackle as i know it may be gone with one battle gone wrong!"
6665758,nitroman,2022-06-19 12:34:00,368,Just got back last night from 2 weeks at Cedar. Fishing was amazing to say the least. Walleye were fast and furious as well as crappies! Didn't matter what we threw at the walleyes they took it. Crappies were in the weeds and had no problem catching a limit in no time fast of 13-14 inch fish. Walleyes on average ran 16-18 inches and we had a lot of fish in the 19-24 range with some big girls topping out at 29 for us. Lots of 24-26 inch fish as well. Muskies were hungry for walleye cranks while trolling and we ended up with 19 muskies being caught in the second week. My wife got a PR 27 inch walleye and I landed a 29 as well. Weather was great for the most part with a couple rainy episodes as well as some wind on and off. All in all a great week. Border crossing was the fastest and easiest both in and out as it has ever been.
6665924,Bill Krejca,2022-06-20 07:47:00,6107,What was the water temp when the crappie were in the weeds? Spawned out? Looking forward to fall trip. Bill
6665954,nitroman,2022-06-20 08:39:00,368,At the beginning of the trip 55-58 at the end of the 2 weeks 65-69. And yes they were harder to come by at the end of the trip.
6665956,troutwater,2022-06-20 08:56:00,299,Dang 19 muskies! That reminds me of grandpa.....one summer when crappie fishing a central IL lake he gave up after catching catfish number 13 for the day LOL
6666064,Bill Krejca,2022-06-20 16:03:00,6107,"Ya, that reminds me of the time I was fishing from shore below a falls in Saskatchewan, after having walked down the portage path. After casting my jig into the swift current, I latched on to a pike, then, on consecutive casts, I caught another, then another, until after the 26th, I just stopped fishing, donno how many more it could have been. I tried switching to a heavier jig, but to no avail, yeah, I used a thin wire leader. Life is heck!!! Bill"

6666160,troutwater,2022-06-21 05:38:00,299,"Definitely sounds like a great trip, nice man. Were you on the east or west side of the lake? I hope all those muskies didn't tear your stuff up too bad!"
