6624248,GrayWood,2022-01-11 13:35:00,14,Thanks Mike hope to see you back again soon. I know some members of your group have rebooked already! Looking forward to a fantastic 2022 fishing season for everyone no matter where you go!
6626280,SweetD,2022-01-19 18:25:00,243,"Went to Beteau Lake approximately 3 years ago in mid-June’ish and was by far the worst fly in fishing trip in my 30 years going North. Different ownership certainly won’t hurt. The mosquitoes and horrible cabins made it almost uninhabitable!!!! Boats and motors were junk. Fishing for Pike was not good at all and we fished hard for them……weather and water levels were not ideal but expected so much more than it produced! Caught a couple 28+” Walleye but overall the Walleye fishing was not consistent or good during our stay. As for Nakina air worst air service we have ever encountered. Scheduled flights weren’t even close and they counted weight to the ounce and gave us some bs that could we have separate charter at some crazy cost if we wanted all of our stuff in. There was no weather whatsoever so that was not a problem. Just poor scheduling and over booked to the point couldn’t come close to providing good sevice. Never again with them. I very well may give Graywood a go one day if they have a different charter provider. If not too many great outfitters out there with exceptional service and excellent fishing. Every other fly in trip in my 30 years has maybe had an up or down but nowhere near the level of this crap-hole!!!I have heard many good things about the fishing for big pike on this system and maybe we just had bad weather and conditions so will chalk it up to that. Good luck and pray for normal water conditions and good weather + a newer much improved owner (which sounds like isthe case) and facilities. Finally, a significantly better flyin charter service or we will never be back that way again."
6640968,GrayWood,2022-03-17 13:53:00,14,SweetD. I am sorry you had that experience and certainly can assure you that things are different under our ownership. There were many issues in the past that have been rectified. We were clients before we were owners so I was in your shoes at one point. The fishing I have never heard anyone complain about so hopefully just a bad week for you. If you ever want to give the camps another try please reach out and I can tell you what changes have been made. All the best. Adam
6665796,GrayWood,2022-06-19 16:38:00,14,If anyone would be interested in seeing photos of the changes we have made or the recent catches from this spring please let me know. I don’t want to get in trouble posting them here but there are lots. The feedback has been excellent. Our Facebook and google page reviews speak for themselves. Thank you to all of you that have already come up this spring. Adam[email protected]

If anyone has experience there, and would be willing, I have questions: 1. Are the cabins clean and not musty? There is a person with asthma in our group, so this is important. 2. I gather that the draw is very big pike. Would this place be a good choice for people who want to target walleyes, but just do a little pike fishing. 3. Is this place past the logging roads? 4. Are people happy with the new owners? Thank you."
6552106,spoonchucker,2021-04-19 14:18:00,82,I would be concerned about water levels at the time you go and in all frankness the cabins and outhouses were pretty rough but the new owners may have upgraded. Mosquitos were at an all time level for us from any of our trips.https://www.onthewater.com/angling-a...e-attawapiskat

6552464,yoopertrout,2021-04-20 11:33:00,1172,Thank you!
6552466,yoopertrout,2021-04-20 11:33:00,1172,Thank you!

6622502,GrayWood,2022-01-05 13:42:00,14,"I know it has been a while since this question was asked. As the new owners I can assure you that all the camps have been renovated. All have new electrical, insulation (spray foam), propane heaters, appliances. All have on demand hot water heaters and showers, multiple generators, and bbq's. Those of you that have been in the past will not recognize the cabins! We are way north, but not at the sacrifice of our camps. If anyone would like photos, or to have a chat feel free to send me a message. Wishing everyone a spectacular 2022! Adam Wood Gray Wood Outfitters"
6622580,rappoo,2022-01-05 17:40:00,5,"All, Altho I have been on WC for quite a long time, I have not posted in many years - til now... As a party of 4, we were at Beteau Lake from ~27 NUG - 4SEP of last year, just after the border opened. From the outset of the planning/prep, we found Adam & the other owners totally helpful in every aspect & they did everything in the power to make our trip as fantastic as it could be! The camp was clean, well cared for, and all the equipment worked as expected. One of the benefits of the trip was that there weren't any issues w/ mosquitoes at that time!! I have been on a half-dozen drive-ins & ~ 15 fly-in trips to Canada, from the Pickle Lake area, to the Goin (sp?) reservoir, as well as a trip to another camp on the Attawapiskat River. Nowhere we have ever been compares to the fishing on Beteau Lake. The first afternoon there, I caught 2 40+s in about an hour. During the week there we caught 8-10 40+, probably 25-30 35+ & many many smaller fish. Largest eye was 24.5 & most we caught were 19+. My estimate is ~ 200 N & 200 W. Went after W when arms got tired & we wanted to eat! The water levels were low at the time, which inhibited fishing in some locations, but perhaps also consolidated the fish, don't know. But there remained a great deal of water to cover & we had a ball. I cannot speak highly enough of the camp, its equipment (including boats & motors), the camp caretaker (Wayne) & how easy it was to get everything in place, especially given the borders & COVID. Nakina air was also great! We had such a great time, we are scheduled to go again in June (will check on Mosquitoes then), as well as the end of AUG again this year. I think I've hit upon the areas that I find most important in choosing a fly-in destination & hope this helps someone. Take care all!!"
6622644,RichA$1970,2022-01-05 22:36:00,1159,I have looked at this camp and Adam has reached out to me to answer any questions I had as I’m looking for a late season place for a party of one. I hope I can firm up my schedule as everything looks first class and it’s nice when the owner reaches out to you and is responsive.
6623168,Mike Borger,2022-01-08 07:04:00,1554,"I fished their Blackbirch camp in September, amazing trip.The new owners have breathed new life into the operation. It's great to see because the quality of the fishery was never in doubt, the original owner was brutal to deal with."
