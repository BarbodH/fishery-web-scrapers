6665340,packpro,2022-06-16 20:08:00,695,"OK. Best shore lunch potatoes with easy cleanup. Potatoes stick to the pan for three reasons. 1) not enough oil in the pan. 2) not enough heat…use cast iron. 3) turning them too soon. This is the biggest reason. The potatoes need to be crisp, very crisp on the bottom to seal in the starch. If you turn then too soon the starch will bond to the pan, and create a soggy mess. Pour them in and don’t touch them. Gently test them in a small spot after 10-15 minutes depending on how thick you slice them. Thinner is better. Our recipe for 7 guys. 4 large russet potatoes sliced thin2 sweet onions- medium diced and set aside2 green peppers-medium diced set aside1 pound thick cut smoked bacon.Heat the pan until hot. Lay the bacon in the pan and cook until slightly crisp. Remove bacon and break up and set aside. Leave bacon oil in the pan. You may have to add 2-3 Tablespoons of additional ( just guess). Entire bottom of the pan needs to be covered, maybe 1/32”. Pan should still be hot. Dump in sliced potatoes. Don’t touch them until crisp on the bottom. When crisp they will lift from the bottom of the pan and not stick. Turn when crisp and add peppers/onion. Cook until the other side is crisp. Peppers and onion should be perfect at the same time. Return bacon and heat to crisp. Give it a try. We dip the pan in water and wipe out with a paper towel. Ready for next day."

6664338,bigwalleye1,2022-06-14 06:54:00,2632,"We fry by the spuds then dump in a can of beans. The moisture helps loosen up anything stuck on. Worst case, put some lake water in the pan and set it back on the fire for a bit. It’ll loosen things up nicely. Or, just switch to fish tacosYou could also forego the spuds and make hush puppies instead."
6664450,oleJoe,2022-06-14 10:24:00,114,Boil a bunch the first day and then slice them as you need them. Fry in bacon juice (grease) with onions. Cover the skillet and do them on med. high.
6664456,ryguy,2022-06-14 10:49:00,11,"we usually will do a traditional shore lunch but prep it all before hand and bring the ziplock bags in our cooler then its just easy.. fish tacos alot too or just traditional walleye first few days without getting too fancy we just bring a pack of kaiser buns and turkey/ham,etc lunch meat and just make basic sandwiches for the first 1-2 days and eat in the boat and keep fishing"
6664622,btyreprich,2022-06-14 19:08:00,1067,"Sandwiches on day #1 followed by traditional shore lunch. On days we don't eat fish, we will have hamburgers, hot dogs, or Italian sausages. Doing a shore lunch takes time even with the help of 3 people - but it worth it!"
6664648,SweetD,2022-06-14 19:55:00,243,"Eat a big breakfast, Eat a big dinner. Fish in-between. If need a lunch eat some crackers, sausage and cheese or a Little Debbie oatmeal pie!!!! Have done 1 shore lunch in 30+ years going North and never did it again. Pain in the arse IMO!!!!! To each their own though. Enjoy how you enjoy!!!"
6664792,ryguy,2022-06-15 07:10:00,11,I find it's all in the prep and how many people. For my group its just generally 2 of us so shore lunches are easy. we prep all the food before hand and bring wood and kindling in the boat so making a fire is super easy. 1 cast iron pan is all we ever need and paper plates we end up just burning in the fire and cover it all back up for nature to take over again. Somedays for us those shore lunches are more like early dinner 3-4pm because the heat is out and fishing slows down so we slow down a bit have a nice early dinner.. fish hard until its dark and then just have a snack back at the cabin with our day ending drinks.
6664810,lmoore,2022-06-15 07:35:00,40,"I know this isn't what you're looking for but the switch from shore lunch to boat lunch was great for our group. We used to stop every day for lunch although we didn't always eat fish, a lot of times it was Dinty Moore or something like that. We got tired of doing dishes on a random shoreline 5-10 years ago and went to sandwiches in the boat and I doubt we'll ever go back. We usually pull into a protected bay to get out of the wind for a bit while we eat. We've actually found some decent fishing spots because someone always drops a line down while they eat."
6664812,Jpat,2022-06-15 07:38:00,10,"We like to use canned potatoes. They come peeled and pre cooked. Just slice them and fry until browned. Also we like Hungry Jack dehydrated hashbrowns. They come packaged in little milk cartons. Just fill with hot water and let them re-hydrate for about 10-15 minutes. Then fry them until they are done to your liking. They weigh almost nothing, so they are great for fly-ins when weight is a concern."
