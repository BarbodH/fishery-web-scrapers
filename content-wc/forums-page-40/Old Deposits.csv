If the camp is open and the border is open I would expect you to honor your reservation or forfeit the deposit. Just my opinion. What do you think? Later, Jay"
6665322,Camoclad,2022-06-16 18:33:00,628,"Good question, I tend to agree with what you have said. If I were an outfitter I think I would say use it by 23 or lose it. If I didn't want to deal with the border requirements then it's lost. The outfitters could always refund them and be done with it too now that there should be some cash flow for at least a season and a half but that is a contentious discussion too. I see both sides of the coin but at a certain point the issue has to be dealt with. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
6665324,Golden Eagle,2022-06-16 18:49:00,2642,I gave deposits for 13 fishermen to my outfitter in early March 2020. Now he needs money and we have all we need. It's his money. 24 fishermen in camp for the opening week bumped the asking price by $200 each. We were rewarded with outstanding fishing for the entire stay. We want our outfitter to survive.

For each no show it's a huge loss in revenue and to there bottom line. I want them to be successful because their success means nicer cabins, well maintained equipment and a clean camp. It's a wonderful experience that I hope I can enjoy for years to come. TonyO"

When I re-booked for this year, they asked for more deposits, essentially making us forfeit what we already paid. Since we were hesitant to invest more money into a trip that might not happen (you just never know these days), I asked them to roll over our deposits one more time and they agreed. I cannot say enough nice things about their operation and customer service."
