Our route takes us through I-Falls/Ft Frances, Dryden, and Sioux Lookout."
6663536,CI_Guy,2022-06-10 19:20:00,2118,Just using my credit cards has been the best exchange rate for me for several years.
6663538,SterlingArcher,2022-06-10 19:47:00,92,The camp we stay at doesn't take credit cards otherwise I'd go that route.
6663586,BuckeyeATC,2022-06-11 06:53:00,88,"Just use an ATM in Canada. Might have to pay a couple of bucks in fees, though. This is what we always do easy, quick and hassle free."
6663592,SJC305,2022-06-11 07:19:00,154,"I started getting ready for my trip at the end of August and ran into this issue also. I previously used AAA, as they had good rates and no fee for members. Unfortunately, AAA stopped due to COVID and said they aren't starting currency exchange again until the end of this year. After that, I started looking at local banks and called the duty free americas store at Sault Ste Marie. Local banks had a reduced rate, which was their fee for ordering the money. ($1 to $1.16) One bank local to my area did it for a flat $8 fee, which is who I'm going to use. The duty free had a $500 maximum. Other then that, there was a suggestion for a Casino across the border, but thats a last resort."
6663980,Fishquest,2022-06-13 05:22:00,89,The guys in my group cross at the Niagara Falls border and say the casino gives them the best rate for exchange. While they are there they stretch legs a bit and drop some coins in the slots one of them actually won enough to pay for his whole trip once.
6663984,SterlingArcher,2022-06-13 06:15:00,92,There's no casino anywhere near our route unfortunately.
6664700,drlee,2022-06-14 22:01:00,409,"Yup. Use your Credit Card. My camp won't take them, but everywhere else does. American $$ only at Camp. I get it. No worries. I leave them a good deposit so they can play the exchange market. ****. I can't make any interest on my $$ anyway. They might as well use it to their advantage."
6664824,SterlingArcher,2022-06-15 07:52:00,92,We have almost no expenses other than the camp charges - everything else we buy here in MN - so using a credit card isn't helpful for us.
6665468,SJC305,2022-06-17 11:38:00,154,"Did my exchange today after contacting a different AAA location and being told they would do it no problem. Rate was $1US to $1.2119CAD. I prefer to have canadian cash since since the exchange rate is positive to us dollars. I always add a tip onto things other then gas, which is almost half the expense for this years trip."
