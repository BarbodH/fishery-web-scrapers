6665216,bus33,2022-06-16 08:03:00,289,I used my ZLC on Lac Seul for the first time last year. It was really nice to be able to draw an accurate representation of the area we fished. We actually only fished one spot all week as it was producing like crazy. I'm hoping to map a couple of areas we travel through to get to spot as they are a little dicey...a little left or right and you will be on rocks.
6665476,Carnhzkr,2022-06-17 12:39:00,964,"I happened to be talking with Humminbird Support today regarding a different issue, but I asked the support person if I can use a LM chip in one slot, then put the ZLC in the other slot and record to it at the same time and she said I can. I'll put that to the test in one week."
6665490,Ricky Spanish,2022-06-17 13:49:00,1298,"When you have a LM card and ZLC in both slots it will overlay your mapped data onto the LM map showing on screen. It won't save or change the data on the LM card, Autochart just layers the ZLC data over the top on the screen. I hope that makes sense."
6665492,Carnhzkr,2022-06-17 13:56:00,964,It does make sense. Thanks for the info!
6665496,Ricky Spanish,2022-06-17 14:11:00,1298,"Have fun. I remember when I first got mine and went to Temple Bay Lodge. The prior year they had upgraded all the guide boats to Helix 9's and one of the guides transferred all his waypoints and markers to my ZLC card. The ""spot on the spot"" was definitely the phrase of the day that trip. Unfortunately, the following year my Helix would not power up at all so I bought a new unit in Kenora. When I put the ZLC into the new unit it just said ""card locked"" and it wouldn't even work in my old unit after I sent it in for repair. Lost all that good info and never had the nerve to ask if they would do it again after I bought a new ZLC. Maybe I'll ask next week when I get back up there."
6665674,cpk,2022-06-18 19:29:00,27,Curious when you're going. I'll be there September 3-10.
6665744,Carnhzkr,2022-06-19 10:29:00,964,We'll cross each other. I arrive on the 10th.
6664846,Carnhzkr,2022-06-15 08:24:00,964,"I'll be on Lac Seul from 6/25 - 7/1. I've fished this area many times, but this will be the first time using a Humminbird Helix with a zero lines card for recording bottom contour data. I've downloaded all of the Lac Seul data available from the Autochart Liveshare website, which isn't much. This will be my starting point and I'll record my own data from my fishing spots. Is there anyone that would be willing to share their recorded data? Not looking for way points, just bottom data. I'll be on the NW section (Bay of Islands, MacKenzie Bay, that area) on this trip and the Lost Island Lodge area near Hudson in September. I'd sure appreciate the help!"
6664894,SterlingArcher,2022-06-15 10:55:00,92,"Auto mapping technology is an amazing tool. Bit of an investment of time but you end up with the best maps of the stuff you fish the most.I bought a Garmin Striker with a portable suction cup mount for the same purpose on Savant Lake. I can't wait to get up there in a couple of weeks and start mapping. It will be immensely helpful to pin down the exact structure in the areas we fish lake trout and helpful in detailing some of our favorite walleye areas, too."
6664966,Carnhzkr,2022-06-15 13:15:00,964,I'm excited to give it a whirl. We always find those places where we drift past a particular bolder or leaning tree in XX feet and someone gets a hit. This should allow me to see what's creating this spot-on-a-spot.
6664970,SterlingArcher,2022-06-15 13:20:00,92,Yep that's exactly what I'm looking forward to. We have found one kinda nondescript point that is just loaded with fish every year. Once I know more about what the structure actually looks like we can try to find similar stuff in other areas.
6665178,Lac Seul John,2022-06-16 05:59:00,31,The technology looks awesome. I will be using it for the first time this year. I assume this will work alongside / at the same time as my Ontario Lake Master Chip. Is that right?
6665184,Carnhzkr,2022-06-16 06:33:00,964,"No, I don't see how it could. You're either using the Zero Lines card or the LM Chip, but not both."
6665186,Lac Seul John,2022-06-16 06:35:00,31,Oh ok. I guess I have alot to learn! thanks for the response
6665188,Carnhzkr,2022-06-16 06:39:00,964,"Actually, I'm not completely sure. There are two slots for map cards. Can you have the LM card in the ""active"" slot to view mapping, and record to the Zero Lines card in the other slot? I guess I'll just have to figure that out when I get there."
6665194,Lac Seul John,2022-06-16 06:55:00,31,Yea it would be really cool. Not sure how it would look though. I am sure the LakeMaster chip cannot be overwritten. Whatever - either way it will be fun to see how it all works.
6665198,lawson2343,2022-06-16 06:58:00,459,"The LakeMaster chip won't be overwritten. If you have a ZLC inserted and turn on Auto Chart Live it will update your ZLC card rather than save the map to the unit. As to having both chips installed, I believe you have the capability to choose which map to display. I have not done this though, so am not speaking from experience. How to do this would be in the user guide."
