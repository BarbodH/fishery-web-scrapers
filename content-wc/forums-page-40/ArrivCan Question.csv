6665380,BuckeyeATC,2022-06-17 05:35:00,88,"I wouldn't worry about the 72 hour limit. That was originally put in because of the need to have a Covid Test completed within 72 hours of crossing the border. If you didn't hit ""submit"" in ArrivCan you can go back in a change the arrival date/time."
6665410,Old Timer,2022-06-17 07:41:00,255,"The random test is to be monitored on zoom by a Canadian health official. You can complete the random test upon your arrival in camp provided you have zoom access there. The test is to be completed as soon as possible so if you have a lay-over in a Canadian motel with cell access, take the test there. If unsure, pull over after crossing into Canada and take the test from your vehicle while you still have cell access. Regardless where you take the test the health official will tell you how to handle the collected sample. I've been involved in four random tests. The above is based on my own experience last summer and fall. Always best to rely the current rules and not what posters think they are. Canada has a number of internet publications addressing the random protocol."
6665522,N_of_Quibell,2022-06-17 17:11:00,151,"That seems like sound advice to me, but I think you are assuming a cell phone with a data plan, which I don't have. I've noticed Tbaytel has numerous public hotspots in Fort Frances (where I enter) - my plan was to see if I could access one of these hotspots via wifi on my laptop if I was so unlucky as to get a random test and complete the test that way before venturing on. So far, I've dodged the random tests both last fall and this spring so this idea is completely hypothetical at this point, but I wonder if anyone has completed the test via public Tbaytel public hotspots, and how it worked out? (Hopefully the random test will be phased out before my next trip, but it's good to be prepared.)"
6664780,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-06-15 06:51:00,240,"Hi--I apologize for asking a question that has probably been beaten to death on here.... I am crossing on Saturday, which means that I can complete the ArrivCan requirement today. I would much rather fill out the form online and print. My question is, is that all I need to do to fulfill this requirement? And, as far as the 'random testing' lottery, if I need to complete this test, can I drive to my destination (Nestor Falls), complete the test there, and leave it with my outfitter to mail? Thanks for the help--would really appreciate it!!"
6664804,lmoore,2022-06-15 07:28:00,40,"You can fill out online, you'll just need to have a photo of your vax card to upload to it. I uploaded a photo of my passport also, but I think you can manually enter that info also. I don't know specifics on random testing so hopefully someone else chimes in there."
6664920,elway12,2022-06-15 11:38:00,335,From my understanding you will have to take your test vial/packet and put it in a drop box. I know they said there are drop boxes located in Ft. Francis and Thunder Bay.
6664928,jambi,2022-06-15 11:56:00,504,"I did the ArriveCan on my phone. There were two people in my vehicle. We crossed Int Falls on Sunday the 6th at 12:30pm. Not many in line but waited 30 mins or so. We were greeted by the Canadian agent, and he asked for our only our passports. (I had a printed ArriveCan receipt and our Vax cards but they remained in vehicle) We were asked 5 or so questions. He handed back our passports and said ""your ArriveCan looks good you were not selected for any testing"" and we were gone. He was very friendly. Honestly the easiest crossing in 20 trips. The USA crossing was even easier. Maybe six cars in line. 3 or 4 questions, and it was ""Welcome Home"". Very nice lady."
6664940,Riding high,2022-06-15 12:13:00,69,Not sure you need to print it. You fill it out online and send it. Then it's in there system. If it's not you can't cross. When you get to the crossing and hand them your passport and they swipe it it will show them if you filled it out and sent it. If it's not filled out and in there system you will need to do that. They don't want to look at your print out or phone copy it needs to be registered in there system. As far as the test it has to be dropped in a certain drop box. I would just do it there when they give it to you. There is a drop box close.
6664944,N_of_Quibell,2022-06-15 12:21:00,151,"I've done the ArriveCan thing twice; most recently a few weeks ago. It's super-easy. One tip: many states (in my case, Wi) keep an immunization registry, which among other things includes one's history of covid vaccines - I downloaded mine to ArriveCan. I think there was a number on my passport which I entered by hand. I think I printed out an ArriveCan receipt, but I didn't supply it nor was it requested, as I recall. The polite and cordial agent thanked me for having completed ArriveCan, which I thought was a little odd - I hope I don't seem that impaired! It took 3-4 minutes. The random test never came up either time - somethings are best not asked about, I figure."
6665190,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2022-06-16 06:39:00,240,"Hi again--please bear with me-- I completed the ArriveCan process yesterday. I am crossing at I-Falls/Fort Frances on Saturday. I indicated a crossing time of 1:00 p.m. How rigid is the 72-hour requirement? If I can't get across the border until 2:00, for example, that is 73 hours past my ArriveCan time/date. So I am thinking that today I should re-do the ArriveCan application. Would that mean I have to re-do the whole process? Thanks. Just asking about that 72-hour window."
6665204,CI_Guy,2022-06-16 07:32:00,2118,Last fall they were very strict about the 72 hours. I haven't heard anyone say anything about it this year.
6665206,Further North,2022-06-16 07:42:00,2008,"I had a a similar question: How strict are they about the time we put into ArriveCAN?We estimated 2:00 - 2:30 arrival time on Saturday when we did ours last night, but traffic, weather...etc. could have us there a little before, or after."
6665250,Riding high,2022-06-16 11:40:00,69,Last year I put on mine Friday night at 8 o'clock and drove through around 8 o'clock Saturday morning. The agent looks at me and said you're a little late. I told him I got a late start. He laughed and made fun of me and sent us on our way.
