6664694,drlee,2022-06-14 21:51:00,409,"I go to a camp just north of Ignace, ON. Take my own boat. Housekeeping only. As a solo, the camp requires that I pay for the minimum for 4 guests for my cabin. Sometimes I have a guest to share the cost. I think my total if I pay the whole cost is about $1400 weekly. I stay two weeks. I am fortunate that I can afford to do it. I do like having 1 other guy to share the costs. The fishing is excellent, BTW. Drive in."
6663824,kvman1959,2022-06-12 11:01:00,45,This is probably something that's an impossibility. But are there any drive to or boat in outposts that would accommodate just 1 person?
6663832,Yellowfin123,2022-06-12 11:11:00,2182,"of course there is, if they have cabin thats gonna set empty for a week their gonna book it, might cost a hair more but you shoudn't have a problem"
6663838,reddemon2,2022-06-12 11:29:00,255,"Check out ""Share a Seat"" section also"
6663846,7 Mag,2022-06-12 11:46:00,1887,Several options. Do you have a lake in mind and when do you want to go?
6663904,dvl2700,2022-06-12 16:20:00,371,We went to Camp Anjigami up by WAWA. Had a great time. You can bring your boat. We befriended the college help and he put us onto fish right away. I am sure they have a smaller cabin to rent out.
6663908,CI_Guy,2022-06-12 16:54:00,2118,When we've stayed at Frog Rapids Camp in Sioux Lookout there have been solo fishermen there. It would be a drive to camp.
6663924,Jpat,2022-06-12 19:10:00,10,Woman lake lodge. My dad went there solo once. It’s a boat in from Ear Falls area. It’s about a 40 minute boat ride from loading dock to camp. I’ve been there a few times and was not disappointed. There is a portage lake named Narrow lake. Pretty good.
6663926,Yellowfin123,2022-06-12 19:14:00,2182,"i can think of 4-5 resorts without googling that have small 2 man cabins, lotw, lac seul etc"
6663932,SweetD,2022-06-12 19:34:00,243,"Medicine Stone NW of Red Lake would be a great option. Drive to, remote, no one but those at this camp on the lake…….max of 15-20 people maybe in 4-5 cabins. Excellent boats. Great portage lake access for smallmouth bass, walleye and known to produce several Muskies as well. Main lake is excellent Walleye fishery. Also a few Lake Trout in the lake.We had a great trip there in 2017. I’m sure a single could sneak in there. If not and willing to join up with others might find a group on here looking to add to their group!!!!"
6664112,PhilTickelson,2022-06-13 13:23:00,84,"Give Ian a call at Five Lakes Lodge, I know he has one cabin that he normally books for smaller groups. Not sure if he'd book for one, but if it's fairly last minute and he has it open I'm guessing he would. Great lodge, great fishing, and nice camp boats if you're renting a boat."
