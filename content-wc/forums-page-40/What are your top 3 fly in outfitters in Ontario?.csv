My top three are Slate Falls, Slate Falls, and Slate Falls out of Sioux Lookout with Vern Hollet. I am sure he is retired now. Lake St. Joseph is the best walleye lake anywhere in the world. book it."
6664912,SweetD,2022-06-15 11:22:00,243,"Never met Verne (who is retired now) but Ryan who runs Slate Falls Outposts now is excellent in every way in terms of communication, service and ensuring all the ducks are in a row for a quality experience in the bush!"
6664996,drlee,2022-06-15 14:12:00,409,Good to hear!
6665112,LXAdventures,2022-06-15 19:46:00,5,This looks great. There are a lot of good recommendations on this thread.
6665114,LXAdventures,2022-06-15 19:51:00,5,"I see three MLO camps...Ogoki Resi, Short Lake, and Mojikit Lake. Do you have a recommendation between these lakes and cabins?"
6665286,ryguy,2022-06-16 14:01:00,11,so they are all technically on the same lake but not really but joining lakes. I've done Ogoki twice and its fun but alot of timber but the fishing is amazing regardless.Last year we did a trip down to Mojikit but not to the camp just to the hydro water dam but the govt put up a new barrier seriously 1/2 mile away from the dam so you couldn't get out of the boat and walk down safely even. there was a portage sign but we didn't really want to go too far into the bush. Funny with all that current we only caught maybe 20 walleye that time (late morning) but the lakes are REALLY far apart like hours in the boats sometimes its not worth it when the fishing is so good all around you alreadyMLO at Ogoki has all new 16' Lund boats which are so nice for ripping around in we found.
3696194,55walleyes,2015-03-26 18:39:00,131,I have been going with Hidden Bay since they bought Hooker Lake outpost from Anderson's. That was quite a while ago. My only complaint is they no longer go to Hooker Lake. Hooker is my favorite. Once Hooker outpost closed flew with them to Highstone once and now go to Blackstone. I have investigated other options but always go back with Hidden Bay. I know what I am getting and they have been good to me.
3697394,adempsey,2015-03-26 23:44:00,963,"I go to Hidden Bay's Blackstone Outpost every day.Virtually, at least. It's my computer wallpaper =)"
6664202,LXAdventures,2022-06-13 19:06:00,5,I like this thread. I have only taken one fly-in trip and it was back in 1990. We went to Lake Mojikit. I am curious if the respondents to this thread can match a favorite outfitter with a favorite lake.
6664460,ryguy,2022-06-14 10:52:00,11,Mattice Lake for sure! great operations but I sadly can't do Ogoki res. 3 years in a row so this year we are going with Boreal Forest as the are awesome so far and nothing but good reviews and they bought some of the MLO camps.
6664468,jveri,2022-06-14 11:13:00,70,"@ryguyyes MLO does run a first class operation, I am leaving Thursday am for my 11th fly in with them. Been too whitewater 10 times and this will be my first to Ogoki"
6664476,ryguy,2022-06-14 11:46:00,11,"awesome have fun.. we loved whitewater too. Ogoki is so much fun but bring lots of jigs, use good braid if you do and just be cautious in the boat for logs near the surface.. right around the camp island just troll you'll snag them and behind the camp there is a bay that goes out to the larger part of the lake if you slow troll that the water has a big dip and shallow spot but we nailed some BIG pike in there if your heading towards the falls on your left side there is one part of the lake with alot of trees sticking up.. you'll find it.. if you troll through there you'll nail some huge pike too walleye are literally everywhere tho John is great if he's still there too.. they run a great operation enjoy!"

6664506,SweetD,2022-06-14 13:12:00,243,"Been with alot of good ones over the years. The lakes and outfiiters serving them have changed alot over the past 30 years. A few of my favorites in no particular order:1. Joyce Lake - Boois (1st Fly-in) now?2. Kitchi Island (although that is Manitoba) ?3. Wright Lake - L&M now Clarks4. Arc - Slate Falls Outposts5. Kapakik - L&M now Clarks?Headed to Root Bay with Slate Falls Outposts in 30 days! Will probably stick with current outfitter as they have proven to be tremendous with communication, equipment, flexibility etc. Been to many many others all of which were good trips into the bush."
3632466,Pikeslayer8,2015-03-09 20:10:00,1460,"We went to Birch back in 1981. Nice big lake with good fishing, but didn't have a very remote feel. Lots of float plane traffic in the air and too many boats on the water for our tastes. I'd like to try out their Pipio camp. With Shikag now a walleye santuary, bet a lot of those big protected gals slip into Pipio. http://www.northernwilderness.net/lakes/pipio-dasant"
3632602,Ebarnett,2015-03-09 20:40:00,60,"I have looked into both NWO and Rusty Myers as they both look like they have awesome camps on fantastic lakes.....however....i dont understand their package rates being for such short weeks (NWO is a 5 day and RM is a 4 day?) dang it! If we are going to travel 24 hours one way to North Western Ontario, I want to stay longer than 4 days! I understand the whole ""guys only have a week vacation so you must include travel time in the week"" but a lot of groups (including mine) want to go and spend a full week fishing. Also I know you can purchase extra days, but when you do from those two outfitters the trip starts to get pricey....in other words most outfitters give you a 7 day trip for the same price that NWO and Rusty Myers gives 5 and 4 day trips. Any way just my rant, because both of those outfitters look great."
3632650,Pikeslayer8,2015-03-09 20:50:00,1460,"Pretty much cuts to the chase. Little more pricey, but theoretically one could cross the border and be in the air, headed to paradise in a matter of hours."
3632706,Mike Borger,2015-03-09 21:05:00,1554,"If I have a choice I'm picking a larger lake - I LOVE big water. But lots of boat traffic doesn't sound great. Everything is in perspective though. Whitewater which I fished last September was awesome, far better than many of the smaller bodies of water I've fished. There's a number of other outfitters operating on that lake as well. After hearing what you're saying though I'd probably lean towards Wabakimi."
3632746,chris.brock,2015-03-09 21:22:00,112,"Malcolm Leuenberger runs a great operation too. Mattice Lake Outfitters, like others have said, can't be beat. Here's an obscure one, Oliver and Jean, Caesars North Camps in Quebec. Solid guys."
3636098,captjake,2015-03-10 18:06:00,2,"I have had good luck with Hawk Air. Nice cabins, most have electrical (generator) and running water with showers, boats don't leak and motors run good, friendly owners and pilots. Always caught a lot of fish. Rate this year is $950 for 5-7 nights. Which seems lower than most. They fly a turbo otter so you get everyone and everything in one trip. Only thing that can get pricey is over weight fees (beer and ice)."

3695722,Bstar,2015-03-26 15:56:00,564,"Flew into Cobham Lake with Amik Outposts 4 years ago. John and his wife do a great job. John does his own flying in a Otter out of Red Lake. He even flew us in a day early at no extra charge because he had a group coming out on Friday. So he saved $$$ on fuel and we got in an extra day of fantastic walleye fishing. Cabin was typical outpost but it did have an indoor toilet for getting rid of the used beer at night. Flew into Esnagami Wilderness Lodge out of Nakina,Ont 2 years ago. Great lake and lodge for American plan. Big Hook camps in the Opasqua Provincial Park has some nice camps. Flew into Burnt lake with them several years ago. Headed to Fishermans Cove on Lac Seul in July. Been there several times. Great owners, really nice cabins and excellent boats and motors."

I just might have to drop some coin for a father/son trip in 2016. Which lake, though? They all look fantastic. I'm surprised I haven't seen anyone touting the virtues of Hidden Bay out of Sioux Lookout. If you do a search on best fly-ins, as I have, HB comes up again and again."
3620530,Pymbet,2015-03-06 11:48:00,42,"Over the past ten years, Hearst Air has become a go to outfitter for us.They are efficient, great to deal with, and have even accommodated us a few times on pretty short notice.Leuenbergers deserves a plug too, all of our trips with them have been super.We have dealt with five different outfitters over the past 25 years and I can truly say that we have received great service from all of them on every trip.I don't recall anything that stands out as subpar from a service or equipment standpoint the whole time."

We only stopped using them because they sold the rights to our favorite lake.Have used Clarke's Resorts out of Cedar Lake the last two years and are going back again in June. Great fishing and service. We usually never use minnows but they provide them for free (nice bonus)..

Being from New Jersey, we look forward to being in the wilderness just as much as the fishing.....well almost! My first trip was with Sudbury Aviation. Good outfitter (Marge) & nice price, nice cabin, & boats, fishing was OK if you wanted to catch nothing but 2 ft. northren pike all week. Not a favorite. Second trip was with Hearst Air, to Wanzatika good outfitter (Melanie) good price, nice cabin, and boats. Fishing was OK ( sound familiar) fished very hard, even with live bait a few days. Maybe 15 walleye for the week. Caught Pike at will in the weedbeds. It was first week of September, not sure what I did wrong. Trolled , jigged, spinners, crankbaits, worms, live minnows. Very dissapointing for wallys. I like Melanie, she was very nice. Maybe another camp? Anyway not a favorite. Third & Fourth trips 7 Lakes Wilderness Camps, Albany River ( Teabeau) or ( Grassy). I picked this outfitter based a lot on Mike Borgers Dusey Lake report. The outfitter is now a friend Brad Slagle and yes he is good. Good cabin, boats, fair price, Good fishing!!!! This July heading to the Dusey for 2 weeks. So my one & only favorite.......so far. Wishing all you guys good , safe, fun trips this year! Beer Slayer ( Kenny)"

NWO is my outfitter and has been for well over 35 years. My group has been treated very well over the years. Been a few times over those years we were weathered out of camp and had to miss a few days on the front end of our trip. NWO would bend over backward to get us to camp safely (though we definitely did some scandalous stuff in those days) and try to get us a few extra days the next year. Yeah, NWO is a great outfitter but more like family. 1. Northern Wilderness Outfitters 2. Rusty Myers 3. Pipestone The only three fly-in's to Wabakimi get my vote."
3632418,Mike Borger,2015-03-09 19:56:00,1554,Have wanted to try Northern Wilderness since you brought them to my attention. Beyond Wabakimi I'd love to try their Birch Lake camp sometime.

Our favorite has been Gull Lake on the cat river system. It is currently run through Red Pine Lodge and Outposts and has the best fishing I can ever imagine. When I first started going it was still part of Slate Falls and I wouldn't hesitate to go book with Verne again somewhere. As mentioned earlier...top notch operation."
3618954,Mike Borger,2015-03-06 05:51:00,1554,Would be curious whether any of you guys have fished Slate Fall's Eagle Island location on Lake St. Joe? I'm fishing there in August and would love to hear from anyone who's been there before.

We have had many great trips to Goose and Unnamed lake over the years. At Unnamed a guy in our group caught a 30.5"" walleye and his very next cast he caught a 27"" walleye. It's a record that has been hard for our group to top.Bill and Louise are great hosts. One year we were scheduled to fly out Sunday morning and catch a Bearskin flight to Winnipeg. Bill came to cabin about 8:00 Saturday night and told us the weather was moving in and if we were going to make our Bearskin flight he would need to fly us to Red Lake that night. We had the plane loaded up and ready to leave when Louise told us that she could not find an open motel room in Red Lake, but if we didn't mind we could stay at their house, and we did!

After a few drive-in trips over the years, we did a fly-in to Keeper Lake with Nestor Falls Fly-in Outposts and had a great trip with them. Last year we figured to drive all the way to Red Lake and save some money on flying time. We went with Amik Outposts Lac Seul Airways, Ltd and had a great trip as well to Findlay Lake. We are going back with them this year to Loree Lake. My search on here hasn't turned up much about them except some negative reviews from a few years back. I hope I'm not missing something. MLO sure gets a lot of good reviews but I find it hard to believe the fishing can be much better than what we have experienced already. Love this site but it sure makes a guy want to take 10 trips a year and try them all!!"

Absolutely nothing but good to say about them."

I have been a loyal Nestor Falls Outposts customer since 2001, have gone on at least one trip per year, and have upped that to two trips/year since 2011, Larus Lake and Clear Lake. I find it hard to believe that an outpost fly in business (in the $1,500 range for 6 nights) could be better run than Dave and Michelle's outfit, but if there are fishermen here who have been to a Nestor Falls outpost lake and found better fishing and accommodations somewhere else, I'm all ears. Am really interested in trying Mattice Lake Outfitters now. When the Lindner boys use your outposts as props for their fishing shows, you know you've got a good thing going, and that's the case at Nestor Falls Outposts."

We're a pretty simple group ( some would say simple minded), we don't ask or expect too much to make us happy. If we have a remote lake all to ourselves, a dry place to lay our heads, a boat that floats, and motors that run, then we are a pretty happy group. Having said all of that, we have found no one that does it better than Leuenbergers for the price. Their most expensive outpost runs $1195 CAD. Weight limit is 120lbs. and we've never been overweight, lol. They have their own planes and we always get out early. No perks, no frills. Just great fishing on a remote lake, and they have 16 lakes to chose from. We're going to Eddies Windsor lake this June and we are looking forward to that. Been to Eddies Beteau lake and had great fishing and an awesome camp but felt a little pampered with the sat phone and tv and generator. Plus 16 foot boats with new 15hp four stroke motors and cushioned seats. Almost too comfy. Hard to change things if you're getting just what you're looking for.

3615922,Mike Borger,2015-03-05 10:02:00,1554,"As someone who's done a huge number of fly in trips I've experienced some great ones, some so-so ones and some bad ones.I'm really curious who you guys would consider your top 3 Ontario fly in outfitters and why? At the risk of offending some outfitters who I really like, here are mine in no particular order :1.Mattice Lake Outfitters - Great camps, fantastic service and amazing fishing. These guys are hard to top for a lot of reasons. I'm not sure if it's possible to top the overall product these guys offer.http://www.walleye.ca/2.Outpost Camps Inc. - I've used these guys for years mainly because it's an easy drive from home and I can shoot up for a short 4 day trip. Not the same overall experience you'll find in N/W Ontario, but I love it. Decent camps, smaller lakes that are easy to figure out, good fishing.http://outpostcamps.com/3. North Caribou Camp - Fished it last year and was blown away. Easily the best fly in fishing I've ever experienced within Ontario. Huge body of water which I love, great camp, lots of trophy fish.http://www.northcaribou.com/An honourable mention goes to Verne Hollett at Slate Falls Airways. I've had numerous dealings with him and he runs a pretty special operation. When 95% of your clientele is repeat and you haven't done a sports show in years that speaks volumes.http://slatefallsoutposts.com/So what do you guys say? Do you have any gems I haven't heard of yet?"
3615954,SinOrSwim,2015-03-05 10:11:00,1528,"We had easily our worst experience many years ago. Verne had just bought the outpost cabins we went to through a different outfitter. (we went with the previous owner...his last group in that cabin) Verne really helped us deal with a bad situation. We then decided to go to the same cabin the following year with Verne and Slate Falls. Not sure how many years we went with Verne? We switched lakes with Verne. But, he then sold that lake/cabin to one of his guys. At that point we stayed with the new owner because we liked the lake so much. So, Slate Falls was easily the best we have ever dealt with on fly-ins. By a significant margin. We used probably 3 others? Only one of those was bad............and he was awful. But, he has passed away so I won't throw him under the bus."
3616210,Whopper,2015-03-05 11:12:00,340,"Mike I've only used three and one of them is out of the business now. Mattice Lake Outfitters bought out Armstrong Air and Outpost, I liked them, they treated us well. Don Elliot and his crew does an excellent job, the only knock I have with them is I wish they would upgrade the boats at WhiteClay. I've been doing an annual trip to Sportsman Lodge that Brett Geary owns, not a typical fly in. The fishing is good and Brett treats our group well, he has become more of a friend."

Did a nice job on the website too.I always wondered about Art Latto's cabins. Anyone ever been to any of his camps? I don't even know if they are still operating, but it appeared like they were."

LOL!Quote: Originally Posted by adempseyI see Park's has now officially expanded their camps. Hope it goes well for them. Did a nice job on the website too.I always wondered about Art Latto's cabins. Anyone ever been to any of his camps? I don't even know if they are still operating, but it appeared like they were.Yes, they have a lot of camps now. Good for me as there's plenty of interesting lakes I've never fished before.As far as Art Latto goes I talked to someone else about his camps last month. Bear in mind this is second hand but - I was told his son now operates the business and the cabins and boats are extremely rustic.Quote: Originally Posted by SinOrSwimWe had easily our worst experience many years ago.

But, he then sold that lake/cabin to one of his guys. At that point we stayed with the new owner because we liked the lake so much. So, Slate Falls was easily the best we have ever dealt with on fly-ins. By a significant margin. We used probably 3 others? Only one of those was bad............and he was awful. But, he has passed away so I won't throw him under the bus.Another vote for Slate Falls."

I agree with you Whopper . New 16 ft Lunds and 15 hp motors would be great. Don and Austin both mentioned to me , when they first purchased Whiteclay , that they would like to do away with the cabins there and put up a new one . We, my wife , myself and my freinds , all feel a good coat of paint on the cabins and new boats and motors are all that is really needed there."
