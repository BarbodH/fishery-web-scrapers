6664558,Sutsgold,2022-06-14 16:05:00,219,Staying down near Neepwa island on Minnitaki with my family in early July. They want a beach area where they can hang out and relax during the day. Has anyone seen any beach areas near there or are they all underwater? Ruby island? Thanks

But when the water isn't up 8 or more feet, like it was a few weeks ago, I believe there is a sort of beach facing due west, I think. Check it out on Google Earth.Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk"
