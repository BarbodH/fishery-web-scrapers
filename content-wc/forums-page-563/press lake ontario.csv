1122611,lawdoer,2009-07-21 08:13:00,8,"We fished it in early June, for about our fourth or fifth year. Weather was cold, but fishing was good. We had our best luck around the ""red rock"" , in the narrows, and in Hut lake.For the most current info, go to their website and look under ""vacancies and information"". Bar does a running post on the fishing as to where and what is working. Gerry and Barb are wonderful host!!! and I hear that they have even worked on the 15 miles of the worst part of the trip!!! I am jealous!!!"

1125984,Guest,2009-08-03 10:03:00,0,"Promised a report before i went so here goes. Was there july 25 - aug. 1 , this is my 3rd time at press during the last week of july and i'd have to say the fishing was average. Better last year not as good the year before , but i believe this was due to the unstable weather conditions we had. It rained at least a little every day sometimes lightening and thunder ,sometimes light rain, sometimes parlt sunny with wet clouds which made for some beautiful double rainbows. Oh and it was quite windy during the day. The first evening(Sat.) my daughter and i went out and caught about 25 walleyes in about 2 hrs. which was a good start nothing real big but 2-3 over 20"" and a nice stringer for dinner. the next morning was up early and caught the biggest walleye of the trip 27.5"" by the ""red rock"" in about 12 fow on a white gulp on a green head didn,t catch alot of fish on this setup but the average size was better. As the week went on the eyes became more fussy and had to have minnows , tried leeches caught a few but they prefered minnows so thats what we went with. We mostly used 1/4 oz. chartruese but pink (the girls liked this) and white heads also caught more fish at times.We switched up to see what was better , this and moving to a new area if no fish are caught or graphed is what i consider (working a little harder for our fish). Fish seemed to be neutral (subtle light hits like they were sucking on the tail) but stinger on the jig made for more hook-ups.We caught fish on weed edges 7 fow out to main lake humps 15 fow the fish were scattered but we had share of doubles and triples once we found biters. I have to tell this so please bear with my long-windedness. On thur. was out by myself since wife and kids aren't early risers on vacation, was after a few fish for lunch, after picking through fish to get 4 16-17""ers couldn't leave them bitin so kept c@r for a while. I was anchored and the wind had picked so the boat was like riding a mechanical bull but the fish were biting i moved to the front seat to distribute the weight and cut down on the boat bounce. Was there about ten minutes when i notice my stringer being extra active when i went to check it out there was 20# northern chewing on my walleyes, he had one sideways in his mouth could see the walleyes head out one end the tail out the other. As i grabbed the stringer he gave a big kick and there was my walleye GONE. That same day a guy in another cabin caught a beautiful, fat 45 in. northern. Did some casting for northern pretty good shore/weed action on buzz-baits, spinners and spoons . Nothing big a couple 32""ers and lots of hammerhandles but they're all fun to catch. Also caught quite a few while jigging for walleye. We mostly fished ""red rock"", the narrows , grassy river area, english river area, weeds and somemain-lake humps.Never had any 100 fish days but had a couple 60 -70 fish days. Others i talked to had luck at jarvis rapids, rock gardens and hut.Hope this helps if there's any questions post them and i'll try to help you out. Sorry if this is long or all over the place but when a guy starts writing about one of your favorite places....well you know what i mean. Can't wait til next year I'm signed up for 2 weeks YAHOOOO"
