1123011,Guest,2009-07-22 12:56:00,0,"I've been checking in ....waiting for that report...it's as bad as a Kid waiting for Christmas morning. 37 days and counting. I've been fondling the fishing gear and day dreaming a lot as the time closes in. I'll be worthless by the time that week rolls up. Come on Kman, throw me a line....."
1123066,NYBowHunter,2009-07-22 16:09:00,35,"New to this forum - I just got back from a week at Baie du Nord (Air Melancon). The fishing was great with the water level higher than usual. Made it easier to get around. Lost a really big 'eye at the boat the first day - not in fishing shape I guess. Looked to be around 25"". Biggest nord was 13 and half pounds which was ok but we hoped for bigger. We spent most of our time fishing for 'eyes though. Next time I want to spend at least one full day chasing a nord trophy."
1124246,Kman67rsss,2009-07-27 15:50:00,30,"Hey guys, sorry i dissapeared on you. I got home from fishing and life hit. anyways fishing was slower then in years past. we never found big groups of fish. It was all one or two here and there. we came back with our limit though. the largest walley caught was 4.9 lbs and i caught an 11.3lb pike. weather was so so. a few days of rain, and 1 absolutely beautiful day. We were fishing not too far from the Indian reservation, opitchuawen. I know that isnt spelled correctly. We used mostly jigs with night crawlers. We didnt catch the large numbers of fish that we have in the past but the ones that were caught seemed to be larger then in years past."
1124361,Guest,2009-07-28 06:03:00,0,"That transition back to reality sucks after a week of fishing. Thanks for the report. The unsettled weather has been a factor everywhere, here in northern NY State, the bite has been slow....the feeder streams are bank full and muddy, and the weather seems inclined to change every 12 hours. That change is from cloudy to RAIN. Hope things settle down soon. When does summer start again???? This is rapidly becoming the summer that wasn't. 29 days and counting till I hit the Gouin."
1127347,slug72,2009-08-08 19:43:00,34,For those following this thread. I have added daily reports to a ne thread on Gouini Reservoir here at Walleye Central.
1118439,Kman67rsss,2009-07-04 17:08:00,30,Well i am headed out the door shortly. I will let you know how it goes in a week. hopefully i have great news.
1118800,slug72,2009-07-06 12:13:00,34,Kman - Sitting here at work wishing I was where you are right now. Can't wait to hear your report when you get back. Chris
1121110,Guest,2009-07-15 07:57:00,0,Dying to hear about your trip. I'm counting down the days till we head up to the Gouin...45 days and counting..can't wait!
1121368,Guest,2009-07-16 08:37:00,0,"buzzard, I am heading up the same week as You are it seems (first week of Sept). One more person on the lake, sorry :-) Me and my dad are staying with Air Melancon. First time to Gouin, looking forward to it, wishing time away and prep-ing tackle. BTW, thanks to all for Your input on fishing gouin, much appreciated."
1121383,Guest,2009-07-16 09:45:00,0,"My group did two fly-in trips years ago with Air Melancon. Neither trip was to the Gouin.....we went to Lake Natakim. We found Air Melancon to be a top-notch business, with excellent accommodations and boats/motors. A first class experience in every way, you will be impressed I'm sure. The prices got too high for us when the fuel crunch hit. Good luck on your trip and post a report when you return home."
1121451,Guest,2009-07-16 12:57:00,0,Will definitelly share my experience.
1121618,5 of Diamonds,2009-07-16 22:16:00,151,I've fished on the Gouin Reservoir four times through Caesar's Lodge. I remember quality Walleye fishing and medium-to-small Pike during our trips. I love that body of water though. Looking forward to hearing details about everyone's trip. Please share when you get a minute. Best.
1121638,kyle870,2009-07-17 05:05:00,26,Anyone hear from Kman after return from gouin?
1121767,Guest,2009-07-17 12:03:00,0,"My bet is that he is in the midst of that terrible, painful transition back to reality after a week in paradise. Once he gets back in the work groove we'll hear from him."
1121924,kyle870,2009-07-18 05:27:00,26,"We take our own boats 125mi on a so called road so when we get back it takes aweek to get the gouin walleye, pike, and worm gurry out. It keeps you connected till its gone. He will be back too bad."
1117408,kyle870,2009-06-30 05:06:00,26,we trolled harness with crawlers shallow go where the wind is crashing the shore no matter where that is theres alot more fish shallow than people think 3 to 10 ft wind is the key if your stuggling running the boat to keep it off the rocks thats perfect all the shallow fish are biters tip use as much weight as you can effectivley fish first bait thru gets more bites and the big ones. My partner kicked my butt till i caught on.
1117453,Guest,2009-06-30 08:34:00,0,"The first time we went to the Gouin (6 years ago) we experienced what you just described. The fishing was amazing, in that we were tossing crankbaits into the shallows and retrieving them back to the boat. The only difference was that there was very little wind....yet still the walleye were right there next to shore in the shallows. Crazy to think that those eyes, that supposedly crave dark conditions, would be in 3 feet of water on a sunny day. It was like bass fishing, except it was walleye fishing. The baitfish must have been stacked up along shore. Thanks for the reply and the report....60 days and counting till we hit the water on the Gouin."
1117507,Guest,2009-06-30 12:50:00,0,"Love worm harnesses and bottom bouncers, my presentation of choice for eyes. I like using Dixie Spinners, and try to keep an assortment of colors and blade types. Did it make any difference on your trip whether it was a round bladed spinner or a willow leaf bladed spinner? Green eh? Chartruse green or regular dark green (forest green)? I got to stock up. 60 days and counting! Thanks for any tips! TB"
1117612,kyle870,2009-06-30 19:39:00,26,Dark green indiana 4s 5s last day orange and yellow colorado 5 they tolerate shallow because of stained root beer water. you didnt here this from me but when you catch fall fish those silver looking morsels that people think are white fish cut the belly out from gills to vent drag that on a harness can shut crawlers right off.
1117613,kyle870,2009-06-30 19:45:00,26,3yrs ago went up in late august no bugs cool nites stunning vistas walleyes were 20 to 35 ft caught the dickens out of them lead core husky jerks 14s want to go back any room for me. Have post gouin depresion syndrome.
1117665,kyle870,2009-07-01 03:49:00,26,we tie our own harness on 20lb fireline helps alot on pike and rocks the stiffness makes them pull real straight.
1117782,Guest,2009-07-01 12:35:00,0,"Thanks for the info! We're excited to be going there from Aug 29th-Sept 5th. The other times we went there were in July, and man was it humid and HOT. Really hoping for some cooler weather, we have been to other places that time of year and it was perfect weather....especially in the evening, nice and cool in those small cabins so you could sleep comfortably. There's nothing quite like sweating all night in a 90 degree cabin full of farting, snoring fishermen. I can't wait. We have done well with the Deep Little Rippers for cranks at that time of year....and last time we were at the Gouin anything blue in color for a crank was the ticket. Now that I have an assortment of blue, something else I have only two of in that color will be the key. That's walleye fishing, the cranks in the catalog catch more fisherman than they do walleye. Great chatting with you. I'll send a report when we return."
1118151,McQ,2009-07-03 06:07:00,615,"Just returned home yesterday after a six week stay at Nemio. Water levels are high and the big fish were shallow. On Wednesday I finally managed a few fish deep at 20' but the good bite has been consistantly between 2 & 8' on sand this year. Early temps were unseasonably low in the 20's and things didn't warm up until mid June with a week of high eighties - when I left Thursday morning though it was 60 degrees and the long range was for more of the same - quite comfortable. The spawn was all mixed up this year, everything was running 2 - 3 weeks behind norm and it took nearly all of the 1st week putting things together but then it was typical Gouin action. Rigs with halographic silver or gold blades and crawlers produced the majority of my fish with cranks producing well in the evenings trolled shallow (#5 Shad Raps in walleye pattern) worked best. The jig bite was nearly non existant but we had a few days when 1/8 Nuckle Balls sporting a leech tore the fish up on 8' sand flats - the key was to drift the flat. The next week or so will see the fish settle into a shoal bite in 15 - 20' depths, points will turn on too. An amazing number of 40' plus northerns were caught this year and gave quite a few of us a thrill. Best walleye for the opener was a 32""er and the top northern came in at 28 lbs. I'm heading back up the 1st of August for another 2 week stint - see you up there Chris."
1118222,Guest,2009-07-03 11:38:00,0,"Glad to see you're still here. I should have guessed you were out on the water....far, far away from computers and phones. Six weeks! I'm jealous. We are so pumped for this late August/early September trip. I've been dreaming of conditions much the same as early fall here where I'm from (just across the border from Cornwall, ON) . Been toying with the idea of using frogs up in a swampy creek inlet near where we stay on the Gouin. Those big eyes sure like the frogs when they're moving to the lake. Who knows? We're preparing for some cold weather, but hoping we catch some nice Indian Summer weather. Packing the gloves and long johns just to be sure. Good to hear that the water levels are up once again. A couple of our guys are crazy for a big Nord....sounds like they will maybe see their wish happen. I'm happy with a steady diet of walleye myself. Thanks for the reply and any further updates you can provide."
1118340,slug72,2009-07-04 07:43:00,34,Great to hear your report McQ. We can't wait to get up there. Both of my boys after doing a little fishing yesterday said that they can't wait for the trip. Its hard not to wish time away when a fishing trip is coming up. I am going to email you a couple of questions in a couple of days. Hope you don't mind. Good luck to eveyone on their upcoming Gouin trip. Hope everybody will post results here when they get back. Chris
1113665,Guest,2009-06-15 09:04:00,0,I'm wondering what the water levels are like this year up on the Gouin. We have a trip planned for late August. We were there last back in July of 2007...and the water levels were quite low then. Any thoughts on how current levels compare to those of '07??? Counting the days till our group goes to walleye paradise. Any input appreciated. Have not seen the posts from McQ ....the Gouin used to get some threads on here....what happened? Thanks!
1113705,slug72,2009-06-15 11:13:00,34,"I'm taking my first trip to Gouin this summer. So, I can't help too much with water levels but McQ is still around. You may want to try PMing him. He responded to some posts this spring about the Gouin. I got the impression that he was spending a few weeks on the Gouin early in June. So he may not have internet access for awhile. Its worth a shot though as he was very helpful in our trip planning. Good luck on your trip. Chris"
1114884,Guest,2009-06-19 06:49:00,0,"Thanks for the reply. Hard to believe that nobody else on this site has any input on the Gouin. Such a walleye fishery! I realize that many are from the mid-west, maybe that's why.....the Gouin in northern Quebec is just too far away. My group and I have been to many places in Eastern Ontario and western Quebec, and all agree that the Gouin rules them all. What part of the reservoir are you fishing on? What outfitter? We book with Martin Outfitters and fish the western corner of the Gouin, the Baie du Male. It's such a huge body of water...I'm convinced we have not seen 1/10,00th of it. Good luck to you and your group. I'll put up a fishing report on the Canada forum our return in early September."
1114982,slug72,2009-06-19 13:11:00,34,We are fishing with Nemio Outfitters at the Nemio River between Baie du Nord and Baie de l'Est. I am taking my two sons (14 and 11) and my dad. I had initially planned on a trip out to NW Ontario as the talk on this board make it sound great. But the 24 hour+ drive from South Central Pennsylvania just didn't seem doable. I am excited about the Gouin. We're going early August. I hope we can catch enough to keep the days interesting. My biggest concern is not having some panfish to back us up with the boys if the walleye/pike fishing is slow. But I am sure we'll have a great time regardless. Chris
1115456,Guest,2009-06-22 06:29:00,0,"Good for you! I took my two sons up there when they were that age....the stories they came home with are family legends now. Have a great time, I know you will. No need to worry concerning the need for panfish to stay busy....the walleyes and nords will keep the boys happy. What we found, for whatever reason, was that bait worked best in the mornings ( we use crawlers and bottom bounce Dixie Spinners).....then in the evening, crankbaits ruled the water ( Deep Little Rippers, Jointed Rapalas). One day the boys sat on the dock and were catching little shiners with panfish lures....I told them to be ready for a Nord. They all laughed and said ""There's no Nords in this Bay"". Moments later a 4 footer grabbed a shiner on the way in.....a big scramble for a net...but he let go before the net arrived. Good times. Hope you guys have a great trip!"
1115491,Seanik,2009-06-22 09:02:00,218,"Slug, We have been to the Gouin several times in early Aug. at Walleye Point located in the Baie du Sud. Our #1 bait was always leeches fished on the bottom with a slip sinker followed by crawlers. We don't do much trolling but it seemed the bigger Walleyes were caught this way. On the way up through Gateneau there is a bait shop off Rt 50 on LaBrossee Ave that sell leeches by the pound fairly reasonable. Many gas stations and stores along the way sell them out of bait vending machines at around 4.00/doz. or more. The leeches will stay alive a long time if you keep them cool. Also if you are there during the week there is a bank nearby thats handy to exchange US dollar to Canadian dollsrs. We usually leave Erie on a Friday and overnight in Mt. Laurier, then its only about a 4 hour drive the next day. Mt. Laurier has reasonable motels, great resturants and a lot of things to see and do. There is a flea market as you enter town from the South that has great items including fishing gear, we usually walk out of there with a lot of stuff and as you know everybody needs stuff. If you need more info on the baitshop on LaBrossee email me I have the phone # and address in my files, it's wise to call ahead about a week in advance to place an order. Good Luck and good fishing Seanik"
1116300,Guest,2009-06-25 06:26:00,0,"Are you going up this summer? In August? If so, please post a report, especially concerning the water depth. We arrive on the Gouin on August 29. Can't wait. Good fishing to you and your group. I'll post a report when we return."
1117127,Kman67rsss,2009-06-29 06:47:00,30,"I am going to the Gouin Reservoir this sunday, July 5th. I was last there in 06 I think. I am headed up with my father in law and bro in law, along with some others. I gotta find the name of the outfitter but he flys us up the reservoir and we stay on a house boat. Its a great time and we have never had to rely on panfish to keep entertained. Plenty of walleye and northerns. I will post back the outfitters name when i think of it. along with water level when i get back on the 12th. Im in central NH but it is still a hike up there."
1117198,kyle870,2009-06-29 10:57:00,26,Just got back from the gouin last friday water was up alittle from last 2 years temp was 90 to over 100f flat no wind we incinerated caught plenty of dore some pushing 6lb shallow 3 to 8 ft was most productive the dew worm out fished everything 3 to 1 GREEN harness ruled.
1117302,Kman67rsss,2009-06-29 17:14:00,30,The outfitter we use is pourvoire riviere la galette. week from now i will be there. cant wait. hopefully we dont have the hot weather that you had kyle870. Were you jigging/trooling? What was the average sized fish? thanks
