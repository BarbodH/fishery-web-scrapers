I was wondering if anyone had a report on the conditions on the English River or specifically the area below Manitou Falls?What is the weather been like and does anyone know what they are predicting for the next two weeks?What are the water levels like this year?Can you get into all the lakes?How have the bugs been in the area?Most of all, how has the fishing been??Any report would be helpful as we are having a pre-trip meeting on Sunday and we would like to be as prepared as we can?"
