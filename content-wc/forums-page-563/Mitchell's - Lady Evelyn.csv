They're the same Mitchell's that you had to go through to get around the dam. Elsie was the older one way back when and Marlene was her younger (50's) daughter. Was talking to my dad and just wondering their camp is still around? Can't find anything about it on the web. Thought someone who had been to Lady Evelyn recently might know."
