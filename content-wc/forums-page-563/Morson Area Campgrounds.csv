1126832,King Canada,2009-08-06 11:11:00,27,Being in Construction it has become obvious theres no way I am going to make it for a full fledged Fly-in like previous years so I have decided to do a fast strike camping trip across the border. Does anyone have a recommendation for a campsites around Morson. Either a public campground or a resort would be fine. I need a Canada Fix before I can face another winter.
1126861,johnboat,2009-08-06 13:27:00,2014,There have always been tents set up at Red Wing Lodge. Looks like they have some space dedicated for campers there. Might try Mylie's Place to. Both are just a stones throw from Morson. Keep'er on the bottom! John B.O.A.T.
