1125979,Busman,2009-08-03 09:55:00,146,Will be going up in September and trying to figure out where to buy beer. Can we go in through Baudette and buy be in Morson or will we have to enter Fort Francis and buy beer there?
1125988,Bill Krejca,2009-08-03 10:18:00,6107,"Rainy River has a store on the right side of the road as you are driving east. I believe the alcohol facilities in Morson closed with the grocery store, but I could be wrong. Emo also, has a store. Bill Krejca"
1126068,johnboat,2009-08-03 16:20:00,2014,"The store is closed. I was there in June and again in late July. And from what I hear there are no plans for it to be open in the future. Buy in the states and pay duty, you'll be fine John B.O.A.T"
1126106,BB3,2009-08-03 18:16:00,48,"Actually, you should cross at I.Falls (about 25 miles closer if you go up 53)and pick up beer at the duty free store and pay duty on any extra. The only time I cross at Baudette are on Holiday weekends, or if the line in the Falls goes out towards the mill."
1126161,Matches,2009-08-03 20:55:00,236,There is a duty free in Baudette. You can buy your beer there. In September they will only be open until 6pm which is the same for the liquor store in Rainy River. Much cheaper to buy at the duty free.
