1127120,guidedfishing,2009-08-07 16:19:00,531,I drive past Cozy camp on 599 on the english river several times a year during the course of my fishing trips. Looks like a nice clean place. Not sure how far you have to go up or down river to get into the lakes. I've fished the english river alone and done very well. It never looks like it is over flowing with people. I don't have much to offer. The river travel is always a little more of a destiny with rocks but we used to do it and you just need to be careful. GF
1127130,bluefin85,2009-08-07 16:56:00,31,We stoped and fished it last year for only 5 hrs. went from camp all the way to barrel lake and fished the river system on the way. Can't say we did very well at all. But we were only there for a short time so we could not give it a real chance. They were catching walleyes on a rock bar in Barrel as we talked to the people fishing. Only caught a few northerns in Barrel Lake and none in the river. If you like lake trout Cecel Lake is a blast when you find them it's just down the road from there.
