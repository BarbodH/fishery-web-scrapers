1106973,Bluff,2009-05-21 17:04:00,152,I have never fished Smoothrock but have heard it is very good. I fish Wabakimi every year and that connects to Smoothrock - flows into it. Good luck!

We generally traveled to the North East area of the lake and fished the different areas where the lake narrowed and there was some current. We were there in August so the fish were generally deep. The South West area of the lake has an outpost but that area is very very deep and I would not recommend that area for walleye or Northern, but there is suppose to be Lake Trout in that area."
