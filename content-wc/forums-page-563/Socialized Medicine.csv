With this forum being Canada Eh? it would seem the logical place for concerned fishermen to get some info about all this bad press about Canadian Health care from Canadians. I really do think it is about fishing. Hey, maybe we want to move there!!!"
1126472,AllenW,2009-08-05 06:49:00,11482,"Be a bit hard I think to keep it from getting political as the people who are trying to institute the program here in the US are politicians.. I'd think. ?And considering the wonderful track record of those in power, I'm not sure I'd like them to do anything, much less screw with my health care..Golden posted a site (thank you) and while not here on WC, it at least should give those who combine politics and health care a place to discuss it.Also while it was asked of our Canadian posters to tell us about their health care plan, I might ask who ever posts what their economical status was?On a other forum the question of health care was also asked and it did seem that the well off had a different view of their system then those who couldn't afford supplimental coverage...seemed that way anyway.al"
1126473,Juls,2009-08-05 06:53:00,13414,"Not if you really really try! LOLHow about talking about the programs without talking about the people trying to institute it.Seems simple enough to me....anyway, that's about the only way it's going to be able to be talked about on this site.Political posts will be deleted.Juls"
1126506,alanexpup,2009-08-05 08:51:00,278,Hi. OK we will keep people out of it. Just the facts jack. I checked out your brother site and did not see that it had the same type blog this is. thank you very much. this is a turning point in our society and it deserves to be here. can you reinstate those post from canada that gave us facts on their system?

1126547,Juls,2009-08-05 11:39:00,13414,"Here's the one from Dipstick:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...cons/icon1.gif A Cndn Response I am a Canadian senior and quite pleased with our health care system. The system of care is so vast and complex that it is impossible to cover everything here. These are just random thoughts in no particular order of importance.Each province manages their own particular medicare plan, with money coming from the Federal gov and the individual provinces.1. Yes, we pay higher taxes than you do in the USA, but our population is a lot smaller and there are costs to operating a modern government that has to be covered by a smaller tax base. 2. The increased taxes I pay over my lifetime for myself and my family do not come close to covering the cost of a serious operation if we had to pay for it. We have had several high cost surgeries and long term hospital stays, at absolutely no additional costs.3. Chronic and pre-existing conditions are not excluded, as in some US private insurance plans.4. There is no Halloween clause. 5. Determination of medical treatment is doctor directed, not an insurance adjustor.6. Treatment is not age determined, except that the patient must be able to survive the procedure and be of benefit to the patient.7. I can go to any doctor in the country for treatment. Not limited to those belonging to a particular hospital or insurance company. Seeing a Specialist is thru a doctor's referral, as there are fewer specialists than in the US. Guess where our trained Specialist have gone? For non-emergencies, there is a wait to see a Specialist. If it is life-threatening or serious, you will see a Specialist immediately.8. There is no total dollar limit for care (some private insurance plans have lifetime dollar limits).9. Our provincial plan also covers medications (called Pharmacare). This plan has a deductible that we pay based on a percentage of last year's income. The lower your income, the less you pay. After you reach your deductible limit for the year, all additional meds are at no cost.10. Surgery, hospital stays, doctor and chiropractic services are covered. We can go to walk-in clinics, hospital emergency or family doctor for service. 11. Most people purchase additional medical insurance such as Blue Cross, to cover the semi-private rooms, the medication deductible, ambulance, podiatry, physiotherapy not covered by the provincial plan.12. The provincial plan also covers home care for those require personal care but not hospitalization. It may be daily, weekly; tailored to the patient's needs.13. There is no visitation fees to see a doctor. Tray fees for minor treatment, such as bandages, injections, minor wound treatment, have recently been eliminated.14. Lab tests are covered. 15. EKG, colonoscopy, stress tests, echocardiograms, yearly physical exams are all covered. I can't think of any diagnostic tests that aren't covered.16. Sleep apnea tests and the breathing machines are covered in my province.17. Some major procedures are only done in certain hospitals in the country. EG  transplants. The population of most Cndn cities is not large enough to support a transplant team and keep them sharp. The provincial plans will transfer the patient to those centres for treatment. 18. Our hospitals are short of nurses and family physicians are in short supply. Unfortunately, many of our young graduates head to the US for higher wages. Our medical personnel are well paid by Cndn standards, but can make more in the US. However, they are quickly learning that malpractice insurance and other hospital and office expenses are also higher there. Some do return because they do not like patient care decided by insurance companies.19. There is a shortage of bed spaces for elective surgeries and this creates waiting periods. But, emergency needs are met immediately, with the best of care.I would not want to give up my medicare. This plan sounds like the kind of plan your politicians have, doesn't it. And every citizen of Canada receives this kind of care. There are faults with our system, as with all systems. Don't believe the TV ads you see criticizing the Cndn plan as they are not accurate and do not provide all the details. https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...c/progress.gif"
1126552,Moondog,2009-08-05 11:56:00,362,"Juls, Thank you!!!! We will try to behave. I have lots of respect for you reinstating this thread and I hope everyone else will as well."
1126710,v-bay gord,2009-08-05 20:51:00,3168,"The Canadian system will never fly in the U.S. (but I don't think that is what anyone is suggesting anyways) It's cornerstone is that it is universal...there are no different levels of service for those with money and those without....we are all lumped into the same pot. Now, it is true that some can bail out south of the border with cash in hand to get the service they might feel they need, but by and large it is ""all for one, and one for all"". I don't see that drastic change being even possible where the medical industry is geared to profits. I think it would be very hard to offer two levels of service...one for those that can afford it , and one for those that can't.....without creating some very drastic inequities. I hope that wasn't too political, and if my assumptions are way off base I'ld like to hear about it."

1126365,Moondog,2009-08-04 17:53:00,362,Hmmm......looks like this thread went to WCBoneyard. I found it very provocative and educational. I did not think anyone was being unruly. Just wondering if one of the moderators would respond regarding the decision to dump what appeared to be a very well read discussion.
1126371,Juls,2009-08-04 18:02:00,13414,"Politics.I agree it was a good thread and very informative.We can't allow it in one thread and not others. That's just the way it is. No Politics. Unfortunately, a lot of hot topics right now are centered around politics.Juls"

1126373,pike50plus,2009-08-04 18:24:00,584,"Juls, I understand you have rules as the moderator and must inforce them. I really was suprised the thread was closed. It is extremely important that people have access to information to make their own conclusions about what should or should not be changed in Our HC delivery system. I have many articles and reference sites that compare the many factors that should be considered. if anyone wants them, let me know by PM. Sad that such an important topic at this time in our countries history can't be talked about somewhere here? IMHO"

Still......with so many going to and from Canada and hearing bits and pieces of what Canada has etc.......would it not be considered an OK topic as long as we all behaved? I am still interested in hearing from Canadians, not so much from Americans pro or con. We are a country divided and half hate Obama and half still hate Bush. Done deal. amen. But if our new health care system is being compared to what Canada has where better to hear about it than Eh, Canada?? Would you reconsider?"
