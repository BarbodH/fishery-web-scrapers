Our goal was to break that elusive 30"" Walleye mark and one of us met the goal. The week was cloudy with rain off and on all week with moderate winds. Excellent Walleye fishing conditions. Temps were in the low 70's every day and only one night was cool enough to fire up the propane heater in the cabin. Water temps were in the 66-69 degree mark which is low for the end of July. Here is the view from our cabin, #5 that we stay in every year. The front deck is literally 10' from the water and you can hear it lapping at the rocks all day and night.http://s155.photobucket.com/albums/s...713_165237.flv We had a good week, catching and releasing over 100 Walleye over 18"". We estimate we caught somewhere in the neighborhood of 250 for the week between the four of us. Here is a video of Jill picking up her THIRD!!! 27.5"" 'eye of the week on Thursday.http://s155.photobucket.com/albums/s...713_203628.flv The highlight of the week came early. On Sunday evening, our second day there, Jill hooked into this one.http://i155.photobucket.com/albums/s...anada09013.jpg 32"" and 11 3/4# using 6# test Trilene XT and a Bubble Gum colored Road Runner 1/8 oz with a willow blade tipped with a leech, Shimano Spirex 2500 RD reel and Shimano 7' Convergence Medium/Fast spin casting rod. It took 20 minutes to land. It should have only taken 15 minutes, but I missed it with the net the first time and it took off to the bottom one more time before giving up. My biggest of the year was 28"", so I still have not broken that 30"" barrier, but it was awesome to watch Jill fight that fish and be the first in our group to officially break the 30"" mark. All in all we had an excellent week, ate fish almost every day again, and brought some nice fish home. We made or reservations for next year before we left on Saturday morning. Anyone wanting any additional information about Lady Evelyn Lake and/or Garden Island Lodge, just shoot me a PM. (I don't get anything for promoting them, I just belive in them that much!!)

That is a beautiful lake.....appreciate you sharing your week with us....I have 2 good buddies that are heading up over the Labor Day week and staying at Island 10. They're also looking for some of those 30"" fish....nice to see both the numbers and sizes your group got into. Rich B"
1125962,micropterus,2009-08-03 08:36:00,450,Now I'm really wound up. We go in Aug 29. Sounds like a great week.
1125987,SkeeterJeff,2009-08-03 10:14:00,31,"Be prepared to move around a lot. The fish seemed to be scattered. We would pick up one or two at a spot, then nothing. We probably fished 8-10 of our regular spots each day, then went back and hit 4-6 of them again after dinner. We saw one school of baitfish on the fishfinder all week. A lot of the fish we picked up were seen on the fishfinder also. Very few ""pods"" like in years past. Most fish were caught in 17-23 FOW with a couple coming from 25-28 FOW. All fish were caught using 1/8 oz jigs w/leeches either backtrolling or drifting. Oranges, yellows, and combinations of the two seemed to be the ticket with some being picked up on chartruse or white. Good luck and please report back on how you did! Jeff"
