My wife and I want to go across Trans Canada after crossing at the Soo. We stayed one night near Marathon than at Marr's Perch Lake Lodge. It was a clean place, large cabins, and people who ran it were nice. We were there only over night did not fish,but it is my understanding that there are pike, walleye, smallmouth bass, and perch in the lake, also there is access to other lakes in the chain where trout are present.
