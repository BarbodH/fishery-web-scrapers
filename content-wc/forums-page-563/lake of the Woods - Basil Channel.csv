Does anyone have any tips on fishing this area. We are primarily fishing walleyes and bass. Any ideas about what to expect, hotspots, or baits? Thanks"

Wind swept shore points will hold fish on windy days. Watch what the wind does and locate current through neckdowns and those will hold fish also.
