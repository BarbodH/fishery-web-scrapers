522395,Guest,2002-07-23 05:04:00,0,"I would love to have a map of the Lake with your points of interest on it. I used to have a good map but I guess I lost it.You will see my brother Mike out there with his friend. He has a 19 ft.silver & blue Lund. He will be there the same week you guys are. He will have plenty of beer so don't be afraid to ask.I guess you guys will get the jump on me. Our family is coming up from Aug. 10-17. I was camping on Lake George a few days last week. The smallies sure like the leeches there.I hope your weather is nice for ya all.We are sure gonna check out your end of the lake this year. I guess I'm gonna have to buy a few shad raps. I was showing my wife the website for Camps Bay Cottages last night, she sure liked what she saw.Thank You for all your helpful information you guys. Where do you all come from Thank you Jack Holton.Our address is 15 Trottingham Rd. Saratoga Springs, ny 12866"
522396,Guest,2002-07-23 07:58:00,0,"The map will be going out in todays mail. Have marked a few places, including the 'middle narrows' where you go into Little Gull Lake. Hope that the night time walleyes like the leeches as well as the bass did on Lake George for you. Does the camp you stay at have another name (Holiday Haven, Cedar Crest Lodge)?"
522398,Guest,2002-07-23 10:56:00,0,"Yeah, my girlfriend's parent own a cottage on the west end and I just got back from a sad weekend of fishing for Bass and Pike, but not to worry two weeks previous I caught 5 bass and 3 pike in a few hours so it is up and down. I have been fishing for a few years at Big Gull and it had some good walleye too!!! Have a great time !!!!!"
522397,Guest,2002-07-26 06:40:00,0,"Hi Sister, Thanks for the map of Big Gull. That was cool. I don't think you live to far from my brother. He lives in Honeoye & works at the only bait shop for the lake.We would love to meet you guys to. My 6 yr old Grandson is ready for his first trip to Canada beleive me. He told me the other day he wished he was there already.Save some of them Walleyes for us.Yes where we stay is also called Holiday Haven & when we first started going to Big Gull in the sixties we went to Lemke's or the Cedar Crest Lodge with my GrandParents.Have A Lovely Vacation. Jack & Betty Jo"
522399,Dennis,2002-07-27 16:47:00,14,Any recent fishing reports? Have the walleye moved to deep water yet? Worms or leeches better?
1127077,Guest,2009-08-07 13:16:00,0,"Hello, I'm from Rochester and have been going to Big Gull for almost 40 years; we own a place on the east end not far from Holiday Havens channel. We have a trip planned next weekend 8/14 for 4-5 days and can't wait. Reading your post has been great. I can throw out a few ideas of where to try; we're usually using jigs or harnesses. Problem now a days is my son is a bass man and I a walleye guy so we are always fighting over who's driving the boat. Honestly I don't care as long as I'm fishing. If you head out of Phypers cove on your left side about 1/4 mile up you will see a whit boathouse out about 20 yds is a very shallow shoal try fishing on the lake side of that, have caught lots of bass and some walleye. further up the lake on the same side you will come to an island with a cottage on it and a bridge this is Swans island try out about 30-40 yds on lake side have caught some big eyes there. If you go a little past Swans and go left you will see another large island try off the point of that, and in back is a cove with lots of pike. This should keep you busy for a day. Good luck Fran"
522385,Guest,2002-07-11 10:57:00,0,does any one have any info on fishing Big Gull Lake in Ontario. I'll be vacationing there in Aug. with my family. Been going to Bill Phypers for a couple of years now. I know the water is real high now.thanks in Advance Jack Holton
522386,Guest,2002-07-12 04:49:00,0,"Are you speaking of Big Gull Lake, also called Clarendon Lake, thats in the vicinity of Sharbot Lake and Arden, Ontario? If so, I can help you out, as my family and I have been going there for years to a place called Camps Bay. We go up for a week in August every year."
522387,Guest,2002-07-12 05:24:00,0,Yes your right. Its called Clarendon Lake also.We stay on the other end of the lake at Phypers cottages in Coxvale. We were always wondering how the cottages at Camp's bay were. We have been going up there for many years also. I promised my wife we would take a ride up to your end & check out the cottages up there this year. We are coming up from Saratoga Springs from Aug.10-17. If you have any info on the cottages on your end or Walleye fishing I would be grateful. My brother was up there the week before the fourth of July & he said the walleyes were really slow & the water was very high. He & a friend fished hard & caught 12 eyes. Is there a website for Camp's.Thanks for Answering me -Jack Holton
522388,Guest,2002-07-12 05:58:00,0,"We have been going to Camps Bay for years. They are typically booked solid year after year.....the same folks on the same weeks every year, it's like a family reunion. We really enjoy our week. The Finch family has been running the place for the last few years and have made alot of improvements on the cabins....yet the cabins are still small, rustic log cabins, just the way I like it. Very clean, good fridges, I'd recommend it to any fisherman: its a camp not a ritzy resort. They have boats to rent, a small store, gasoline. We'll be there the week before you'll arrive. Walleye fishin? My brother-in-law and I spend a great 6-8 hrs a day on the water every day for the week. We always manage to catch enough eyes for a fish fry or two...I'd rate the fishing fair to good. Most fish are in the 2-3# range, rarely anything bigger. We're diehard bottom bouncer/worm harness guys....some of our pals in other cottages are diehard jiggers.....we both seem to do equally as well -w- the fish and have alot of fun bustin on each others methods. One thing that has produced well for us has been the ""night troll"", over the deep water just before and after dark.....deep diver shad raps and wally divers are the ticket....strangly, on this lake there seems to be just that narrow window of opportunity where this produces, we've tried earlier and much later with little success. Of course, everything hinges on the weather.....we've had to work real hard some weeks when it was hot and still, the eyes seem to lay on the bottom and not feed for days at a time....then its time to kick back on the beach -w- the kids and sip a brew. Hope you do well on your trip, I'll give you a report if you'd like when we return from our week Aug 3-10th."
522389,Guest,2002-07-12 06:48:00,0,"Since my brother has replied, I'll add my 2 cents worth. We've been going to Camps Bay on Big Gull for 30 years, my husband since infancy in 1950! Since you're taking the family, try a little bass & pan fishing down thru the channel into 'Little Gull'...it's like another whole large lake to discover - shallow, lots of bays, some islands, varied shoreline and if you hit it right a bucket full of panfish for the kids. Some of the guys who come to Camps Bay the week we're there are very serious Bass fishermen, they make out well too. Muskies in Little Gull on occasion. Is there a website for Phypers in Coxville?"
522390,Guest,2002-07-12 10:32:00,0,"yOU GUYS ARE GETTING ME ALL EXCITED. We couldn't go last year because my wife had surgery on her back. We had to give up our favorite cottage & had to srape a dig to get back on the active list.We are bringing our 6 yr. old grandson for the first time & he is hot & ready. I sure would like to find where the channel to little gull is for some action for him. We have been coming to Gull since the 60's also. Except for a few short years in the middle.Its a beautiful lake isn't it. We fish & swim the six or so miles up from Bill Phypers.Are you guys familar with any of these spots. The hitching post,stepping stones,north narrows,south narrows,fire island,trappers cabin, long island. We usually troll with a harness & bottom bouncer to but we've been doing more jigging with leeches & night crawlers.How far down do you fish with the shad rap & diver? Do you flatline with a line counter reel?Do you use the rap & diver with weight? My brother will be a fixture on the lake the whole month of August.I would like your report from your fishing sucess if its possible. I don't know if Bill has a website or not.Enjoy your time -Jack"
522391,Guest,2002-07-12 11:18:00,0,"Are you familiar -w- Pinnacle point, the Sister Islands, gull rock, the bathtub ( key places at our end of the lake) ? Yes, I'm gettin pshyced too just thinking about the upcoming vacation. We flat line the shad raps, no weight, no line counter....I just let out about 8 pole lengths (6-7' each time) and go with that, in the deep part of the lake between Pinnacle Point, Gull Rock, and the Sister Islands (over 60 feet deep +-). I don't own any downriggers, and this technique works just fine for us. I'll give you a report on returning."
522392,Guest,2002-07-12 11:31:00,0,BTW.....the website for Camps Bay is: www.campsbaycottages.com
522393,Guest,2002-07-12 12:14:00,0,"re: channel to 'Little Gull Lake' After passing by Kirks Kove to your left coming down the lake (the place with the yellow/tan cabins) and Pinnacle Point with the flag on the top of the rocks to your left, keep going down the lake. You'll see a long row of private cottages to your left, at the end of this row is Camps' Bay Marina. It has mostly log cabins, a gas pump, store with hand-dipped ice cream cones that your grandson will love; also lots of 'penney candy' like you haven't seen since you were a kid. Ask anybody there @ Camps Bay about the channel, it's to your right as you approach Camps Bay - past Turtle Island (small rocky island) that's in the middle of the bay. They have detailed maps of the lake there also. The channel has some buoy markers on it. This channel is quite narrow in spots, maybe 60 feet wide. 2 yrs. ago first week of Aug. mid-day we saw a buck in the velvet swimming across, had to almost stop the boat to let him pass. Have extra copies of lake map, can mail one to you if you'd like."
