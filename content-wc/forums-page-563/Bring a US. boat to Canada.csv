No big problem at all, afew things though:- Get two bills of sale, one for the boat and motor and one for the trailer.- Get a bill of sale as well as the title- you can call ahead to the R.I.V. to pre register the trailer prior to leaving.- will have to pay the taxes and duty at the borderIn Canada the trailer is classified as a vehicle, so most issues will be with the trailer."

When I bought my most recent boat 3 years ago I went to Minaki before I even had numbers on it. I was never questioned about it going in or while there. The US guy simply asked why I didn't have numbers and I simply replied because it was new. He just said ""nice rig"" and off I went."
