1125953,Gary from Iowa,2009-08-03 08:05:00,74,"My brothers (4 of us) and nephew went fishing at Bow Narrows on Red Lake from July 25 and left Saturday morning July 31, 2009. The weather was unsettled with overcast and occasional showers, some heavy. While fishing was a struggle some days on our first trip to Red Lake we did ok with our entry level fish finders and no gps. We tried to catch smaller Walleyes for eating but mainly caught them in the ranges of 22 to 25 inches-a nice problem. Northerns were harder to come by. The largest caught by our group was 31 inches, also a 29 inch and 27.5 inch fish and a few under the slot. A number of perch hit our nightcrawlers and leeches as well as one Rock Bass. All in all we were satsified, fishing from 3 to 6 hours a day, laying arround the cabin reading books, telling lies and only drinking one or 2 cans of beer per day. We did our own cooking, including baking bread, biscuits, frying fish, ciopinno (fish stew) baking pork loin roasts, and eating corned beef and pastrami sandwiches and homemake chocolate chip cookies.My brother Mark did quite well with his ultralight outfit, roadrunner tipped with leech or crawler, no leader and caching the largest northern and Walleye.My 18 year old nephew would catch more fish if he would get up in the morning but caught enough fish and read enough books to keep him happy. We each finished at least one book while at camp.Brenda and Dan run a nice camp and the staff of Ben, Emily and Jenn, hard working college students gave us good service. I really appreciated Ben's fish cleaning and the unexpected lemon merangue pie given to us-outstanding Jenn! Emily rode into Red River on the Lickedtly Split on the way out of camp, a real likeable pretty college girl. Oh to be young again!Sevensinks (Charley) and his wife was in the cabin next door. Charley let his wife use a crankbait that she promptly caught two very large Walleye on and she wouldn't let him take it off the line. He was still working on catching a larger fish than she the last I spoke with him. By the way, Charley had some very good days fishing.Good quality raingear and waterproof boots with good traction footwear is recommended by me this year. My brother and I each slipped on the water saturated grass and soil-no injuries, but some dirty pants and shirts. Wear the rainpants in the boat in cool weather. Put the rain jacket on if the rain comes. Always take the life jackets and wear them while traveling or in rough water. (The camp reminds me of the backwaters of the Mississippi-lots of islands and pennisulas protected areas close to camp in which to fish.) We had electric start Hondas 20 hp married to a 16 foot lund boat-a very nice combination. No electric trolling motors but you can bring one in if you wish.Hope you all had and will have good fishing this year.Gary"
1126003,stevensinks,2009-08-03 11:04:00,330,Gary it was nice to put a face to your name. I never did get a bigger fish than Barb. Beleave me she has told everyone that she got the first fish and the largest. But then I tell them I got the most fish. [ but not by much ] The last time she fished was 4 years ago in Canada. The next time we go I will have more of those crank baits. I did the MUD SLIDE one day also. I went down at the same time that I was telling barb that she should walk were I was. I never did fish off of the dock. But one of the guys from Texas got a 27 inch walleye from there the day we left. We were the same way as you on getting eating size fish. I didnt know if we were going to have anything small enough for the first fish fry. But then I found one cove that had lots of small fish. we had a good time. I have made up my mind that Im going to keep going back until I have a week with little or no rain so I can see what that is like. Charlie
