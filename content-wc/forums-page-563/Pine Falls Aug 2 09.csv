Biggest 25"" with lots of 20-24"" fish. 4 of us in the boat all had action all day, does this mean the fall run has started in August wow."

1126084,mrwalleye5,2009-08-03 17:31:00,1922,Laurent .... were you catching the fish in the river or the bay? Have you ever seen fish of this size and numbers being caught this early. This is a month or six weeks earlier then when the very first larger ones show up. Were these emerald green? W5
1126149,Guest,2009-08-03 20:12:00,0,"Yes Greenbacks from what I understand its been going on for about 2 weeks or so. The water was so calm we sat on an anchor way up in the bay.. Someone said they caught a 29 at the dock that day but I did not see it, this bite was good. 80% of the fish we caught were green maybe 10 stripers or so with about 3 or 4 drum. I had my wife with me put on a orange jig on her rod got my kid set up I didn't get a rod in for about 20min she had 3 or 4 during that time . Water was 65 deg we sat in about 13 feet of water never moved all day. Send me an email at [email protected] and I will forward the pics.... what a great day . I was going again today but it blew like crazy, if its nice out after work tomorrow I'l be there."
