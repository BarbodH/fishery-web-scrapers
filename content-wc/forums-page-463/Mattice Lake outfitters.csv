I have heard good things about them was wondering if anyone had anything to add. Also has anyone been to troutfly lake? Thanks

Always wanted to do a fly in and it was a great experience. there was eight of us and we caught 930 fish in 5 days. Only cabin on the lake, boats ran great, cabin was good, excellent service. They flew in twice while we were there once to bring fuel and ice second time we needed more beer and smokes. Beer is pricey when you have to have it flown in cost 42 dollars for a case at that time. We went the third week in june if you fished for numbers we could have added another 100 fish easy. Age group was 56 to 12 no one had anything negative to say about trip, lake or outfitter. I would highly reccomend them"

Pringle was great each time we were there. We aren't fish counters, but there were plenty. Good overall average size as well. Each year we got a few decent pike (mid to upper 30""s). As long as we stayed away from the large reef just off basecamp we didn't get bothered with many pike. If we wanted some action close to the cabin that reef was foolproof for decent pike (mid to upper 20""s) and 'eyes on the deeper drops. Don and Annette are great folks. Due to circumstances beyond my control I haven't been able to get back to fish with them for a few years now. First chance I get....I'll be back."
