1351416,Mike Borger,2011-09-20 19:28:00,1554,"My camp is in QC directly west of Val Dor. We have always closed it up and winterized her by our thanksgiving weekend (around mid Oct).When it's nice it's really nice: glorious sunshine, zero people on the lake, good fishing.When it's nasty it's really nasty. More often than not it's nasty in that region mid Oct onwards. Wet snow, high winds, cool temps...If I lived closer I'd keep it open later on the chance the weather turns for the better, but we're 7 hours away. It's just not worth it."
1351428,Golden Eagle,2011-09-20 20:05:00,2642,"I usually see snow both in May and in October, sometimes deep snow. We're going in Saturday morning and flying out October 4. First few days are showing sunny and warm, but snow the last day or two would be okay. Taking my wife along and she'd like seeing about a 5"" snow. I went in around October 16 one year and we were pinned down by a deep snow. Fish turned off, so we sliced steaks from a hind quarter of moose that was hanging in the fish cleaning house. Four of us watched the same two movies over and over and over.Will be above the 51st."
1351443,Mike Borger,2011-09-20 20:43:00,1554,You're an inspiration Connie.You and Norma have a great trip and stay safe.
1351490,vteye,2011-09-21 04:42:00,812,"I've never taken a week long trip in late fall but a lot of weekend 3-4 day trips in Nov/Dec to east shore of Lake Ontario. Wind, rain, snow, calm/sunshine changing all day is common on the Great Lakes that time of year. Truly a great way to extend the season and target big fish.."
1351659,adempsey,2011-09-21 15:02:00,963,"Probably depends on the type of trip, but I fish all year long. Autumn is my favorite season by far, but I always look forward to ice fishing."
1351913,pike50plus,2011-09-22 10:02:00,584,"I would prefer later for Lakers and trophy pike and walleye, may not get numbers but chances for size may increase depending on weather and water levels?"
1352043,SteveJ715,2011-09-22 15:51:00,59,"One perk of going in June is you get the long days, with daylight lasting till 10:30 or 11 p.m. Obviously it gets dark quite a bit sooner now (in September). I think the weather can be equally nasty on either end of the season, early or late. We got snowed on this year out of Sioux Lookout the first week of the season, and I just heard from my Dad, who's up on Lac Seul this week, that they've lost at least a day and a half of fishing due to cold temps, wind and rain. I don't know if it's because I'm younger (30) or what, but I don't care about the weather as much. If I think the boat might sink, yeah, I'll stay back and play cribbage in the cabin. Otherwise, I want to be on the water. The weather is obviously tough to predict, but if you know generally what to expect, you can be ready for it. I've gotten snowed on a few times in June in Ontario, so I packed a winter hat, gloves and the whole nine yards this year. Those snowflakes didn't bother me a bit. What bothered me was my Dad being reluctant to share his Bailey's & coffee, but that's a whole different story. Next year I will bring my own!- Steve"
