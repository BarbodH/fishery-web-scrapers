1351352,Mike Borger,2011-09-20 16:35:00,1554,"Some great input there from v-bay gord.I'd like to add some insight of my own on Eddie if I may.Back in the summer of 09 Eddie had aquired the lease on Beteau and was in the process of rebuilding the old existing run down camp.While browsing WC I came across a post of Eddie's (although I had no idea it was him) where he was describing this brand new camp being built on the Attawapiskat.I was already quite familiar with the fishery on the Attawapiskat through the posts of my buddy Moosebunk who also posts on here occasionally.Bunk had a tremendous trip fishing out of Hearst Airways Pym Island camp about 80 odd km's downstream from Eddie.I sent the poster a pm asking for more info on the newly built camp as I'm always searching and digging for something special.The poster as mentioned turned out to be Eddie. After a couple of emails and a long phone call I booked my group of 6 into Eddies camp for June 2010, his first official year of business and sent him a deposit cheque.Now this is where the true colors of the man show.Later that summer in August we spoke again about my June booking.I casually mentioned to him that I was trying to plan a fishing trip for early Sept...wasn't sure where I was going.Without skipping a beat Eddie says ""Come on up to Nakina and fish the camp! I have a planeload of supplies being flown in so if your group can fit in the plane there'd be no charge""""The camp is still under construction but it'd be nice to see a group in there to check things out for me!""I've dealt with literally dozens and dozens of outfitters over the years and I have NEVER met anyone like Eddie.Who else would invite a complete and total stranger to come up and fish his new camp for free?He had no ulterior motives, he didn't know me from adam, he's just a genuinely NICE human being.I went on that trip with some friends and had a spectacular time. Fishing was off the hook. When I arrived home I felt obligated to try and do something in return for the man, although he had asked nothing of me.I wrote my first detailed Eddie North report and posted it on a variety of internet sites including WC.The response was overwhelming to say the least.I am VERY happy I was able to help Eddie get the ball rolling with his venture.I will continue to fish with Eddie every year god willing, the fishing is world class.Having fished with him 3X now I'm also proud to call him my friend.They say good things happen to good people. In this case it's absolutely true.Cheers, Mike"

I also take with a grain of salt the good and bad comments because they can sometimes be overblown for many reasons. Phish has a point on over abuse of the forum, but in most cases there is sufficient conterbalancing comments that will come into play before too long to end it. For Eddie North this was a positive experience I would think....I even went to have a look at his site. This brings me to another interesting thing I came away with.....or more of a question on ""what appeals to folk who travel to our area to fish""? From Eddies site and the comments he seems to offer great fishing in a rustic setting. From my experience the setting might be too rusic for many folk, yet the positive comments suggest otherwise........which leads me to my own conclusion(s). From reading Eddie North's website I can see that he has the characteristics to be a great host.......I appreciated reading his conservation strategies and how he views them. He's new to the business, eager and obviously makes a great impression with his guests.....hence the willingness to provide the feedback. Good fishing doesn't hurt either. Finally, I find it interesting how we, as posters to this site, are so easily riled by trivial things.

I have fished various outfitters over the years and usually post some sort of report which is based on the experience as I saw it...good or bad. This year I fished at Eddie's and the reason I fished there was largely due to reading some of the posts here and elsewhere. The idea of this forum is to disseminate information to fellow fisherman about experiences that we have all had, the fact that several people have posted positive trip reports about Eddie's is due to the positive experience they had...period. I can assure you that during the week I spent at Eddie's we had no discussion about posting anything on any forum, in fact I am reluctant to post any of my pictures as too many people may want to fish there and I will be hard pressed to get a week.

1350699,phishfearme,2011-09-18 17:56:00,1242,has anybody else noticed the preponderance of trip reports from eddie north?? a new member to this site (and other sites!!) would think that this is the only place where people go and the only place where the fishing is excellent. it may also make one think that there's almost an advertising contest going on here - the most posts on the most sites gets a free trip??? i'm certain that eddie provides a wonderful trip - but i don't think this site or others need ANY additional repetitive reports - what else does one need to know?? phish
1350718,eyemike,2011-09-18 18:32:00,233,I like hearing about the Eddie North trips. I have never been there and still enjoy reading about the trips.
1350751,Mike Borger,2011-09-18 20:00:00,1554,"As someone who's fished with Eddie 3X and posted trip reports of my own, I love seeing the other reports.That said I can see where you're coming from, although it may be a bit off base.How do you curb someones enthusiasm if they've had a great trip?I'm pretty sure if someone had a negative experience at Eddies they'd be sure to let everyone know.Myself I fish with a lot of different outfitters and post reports for each.I always appreciate the reports from other anglers as it helps me when it comes to decision time. I can only hope other people have the same appreciation."
1350787,GOBIG,2011-09-19 04:54:00,126,"I really enjoy the trip reports for all over. Once i get interested in a lake, i ask for details from past guests. I want to hear the good and bad. I also send pm's to others asking for phone numbers so i can talk to them directly. If a place is good fellow fishermen should hear about it, if it is bad, blow it up. I have fished eddies and found it to be the best place i have ever fished."
1350809,TIGHTLINER,2011-09-19 07:14:00,223,[FONT=Comic Sans MS]I also have had the experience of fishing with Eddies North. I found this outfitter on WC along with others that have fished with him. Without WC and the posts others have posted this could not have happened. I enjoy reading WC along with posts and pictures from others. Fishing Eddies was one of the most rewarding fishing trips I have taken. I fished the river system and what a fishery it is. Eddie himself is a person that one can go to for fishing his camp. I believe the posts that have been put on WC are just facts that others have found about him and enjoy talking about him. He runs a great camp and knows how to make the people in camp truly enjoy their trip. He is there if something needs to be addressed and tries very hard to correct the problem. You really have to meet him in person so know what one is talking about. I am in no way connected with the camp and looking forward to a trip back to Eddies in the coming years. Hats off to you Eddie for making not only my trip a great success as others have said the same. :thumbsup:[/FONT]
1350810,Stu,2011-09-19 07:15:00,472,I'm a little confused. I searched the archives and found only 8 posts from him. Am I missing something?
1350811,wallydave,2011-09-19 07:15:00,2151,"Isn't sharing fishing reports, to good and the bad, part of why we are part of this board? Sharing our experiances helps others to make for the best trip we can possibly have. One part of my membership is dealing with my ""trip anxiety"", I have only 38 weeks until my next trip North! Reading about others and thier trips helps with the basics, what color jigs, bait choices, crawlers, minnows and /or leeches, what time of year, what bodies of water, where to stay or not stay. I also like the reports from different anglers, ""some day"" I would like to try some new spots and the posts here, just add to the file I have for those ""some days""! Lastly, if you don'y want to read a thread or post, then don't. Let each person decide what they want to read, or not."
1350822,deputy dog,2011-09-19 07:39:00,305,"i learned of eddie north through solopaddler's trip report on this site as my group was looking for a new outfitter. with the positive postings on this site we were confident with booking with eddie. without the info on this site it would have ben a ""shot in the dark"". this site is an excellent place to gather info, good and bad, on an outfitter. every outfitter's site looks great with all positive reviews so it's sites like this that give unbiased and honest opinions from fisherman not owners. i enjoy reading reports from all outfitters and simply wanted to share my experience. i also believe eddie got alot of bookings from guys who follow this site and also wanted to pass along their experiences at eddie's camp. if there was a contest for a free trip i wish i would have been told as i would've posted waaaaay more times:) there is no conspiracy i assure you, just guys wanting to pass along how their trip went."
1350845,phishfearme,2011-09-19 09:01:00,1242,"[QUOTE=Stu;1350810]I'm a little confused. I searched the archives and found only 8 posts from him. Am I missing something?[/QUOTE] only 8 posts??? find any other flyin outfitter with even half that many - AND did you include the richter lake posts too?? AND - on ANY given day for the last few months you can find an ""eddie north"" report on page one - almost like there's people out there making sure that as soon as an eddie post goes off the front page, it's pushed back TTT (to the top). years ago this board became known as the ""lac seul board"" - report after repetitive report on lac seul. so many that they became meaningless. and there's dozens of lodges and cabins on that lake. fortunatley this lac seul focus has abated and broader more valuable posts exist. and don't call me paranoid - you're not paranoid if people are REALLY out to get you. phish"
1350860,lenray,2011-09-19 09:36:00,467,Phish--is one of da few I take to the Bank when I am looking for super great info.
