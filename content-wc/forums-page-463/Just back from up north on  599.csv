1350856,lenray,2011-09-19 09:30:00,467,Fished in snow on Wed. went up river 12 miles to camp and pork and bean. Ate a few eyes--quite a few. Never bring any home. Very heavy fat ones were being caught. Very good tripper. Only ones on water as it always is.
1350869,Lovetofish,2011-09-19 09:55:00,458,The snow was better to fish in then the rain the day before.
1350889,wallydave,2011-09-19 10:49:00,2151,What camp/lodge were you fishing out of?
1350894,lenray,2011-09-19 11:05:00,467,I never go to a camp or lodge. We just find water that has some difficulty to get into and then portage off that into water that others have not found and fish until our little arms hurt. The water was very LOW up there this fall and it can and will eat a lot of props and lower ends. I was using a 16 ft. bare bones Lund --just using it for the hauling capacity to get food tents motors canoe etc. up the 12 miles and we had to push it off the trailer empty and reload. Thinking it was worth it. Being 66 it was a little work for a geeeezzzzzzzzer.

You were up there last year. I'm still trying to squeezein some time to head up for a chicken hunt and hit St Joe before the snow fliesMike"
1351450,Fishoil,2011-09-20 20:55:00,1277,"It was a good week for us too. We started out in shorts, went to the insulated raingear midweek with the snow, then the lighter stuff by week's end. Did you get much smoke up there Len? We had some for parts of two days but nothing real bad, although the sun sure looked neat when it rolled in above us one day."
1351501,lenray,2011-09-21 06:09:00,467,The smoke was real bad while gassing up in Ignace and the wife had it here in Michigan on Tue. morning. Heard it was coming out of minnesota. The LION will be in Mn. on Sunday---maybe some smoke and heat will be there for the first time in a long time. Ole Fran T. KILLED US FOR MANY YEARS.
