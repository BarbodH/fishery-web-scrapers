1350850,Guest,2011-09-19 09:17:00,0,Has anyone travelled with delta lately and did you have to pay extra for long fishing rods? I have a case with one piece rods that are 7'6'. I am just checking the one bag. Has anyone ran into extra charges for fishing rods?

1351285,pike50plus,2011-09-20 13:39:00,584,"http://www.delta.com/traveling_check...ment/index.jsp Special rules apply to rod cases, they usually count as one piece of checkin Usually by total diameter & lenght combination, you can always call them to double check, they have always been helpful to me on my tips thru the Peg, Egmonton and sask"
1351350,Jigger1,2011-09-20 16:29:00,234,It counts as a regular piece of luggage and the regular fees apply. I pay $60 in fees each way when flying either to Minneapolis or International Falls. Longest rod I take is 7' and I use a Frabill case.
