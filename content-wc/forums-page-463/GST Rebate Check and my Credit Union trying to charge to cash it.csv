1346031,fishmaster,2011-09-01 16:28:00,209,And THANK YOU VBL Gord for sending in our rebate. Recieved it a couple of weeks ago and my bank charged me $3.00 and another $3.80 for a total of $6.80
1346552,walleyeduran,2011-09-03 16:13:00,286,"Frankleigh, you make a good point about how the US citizen is getting a better deal on tax reurn $ than a Canadian citizen. The only problem I see is that in over 30 trips to canada staying in a cabin, (12 cabins in camp) there never has been a canadian staying in camp."
1346562,v-bay gord,2011-09-03 17:11:00,3168,Half the folks in camp this week are Canadians. They are becoming a more important part of the tourism business in the NW...especially now that the American tourists are fewer and far between.....
1346584,FrankLeigh,2011-09-03 19:19:00,80,"I understand what you are saying. Many times we have been the only Canadians in camp or definitely in the minority. I think that most camps in NW Ontario, or even NE Ontario rely on US business. Running a camp is a ton of work and I wish the good guys the best of luck. The HST rebate might help a bit, I guess. The Provincial government could help too, but they seem to have different priorities than helping small businesses.Most of Ontario's population lives around the west end of Lake Ontario and very few guys that I know, would drive the 1000 miles to Lac Seul or area. In fact, Florida is closer than Manitoba. The cost of flying within Canada is ridiculous, so most guys content themselves with the fishing opportunities within a few hours of home.Anyway, good luck fishing and travel safely."
1347166,tv4fish,2011-09-06 08:05:00,2694,"I'm wondering if this is S.O.P. now ??-- I sent in our rebate form on July 6, 2011 for our trip that ended on July 3rd. Just last Saturday -- I DIDN'T receive a refund, but DID receive a ""letter"" saying my request was being ""processed"" and I would be informed later if I DO get my rebate. Anybody else have the same thing happen to them??edit: Guess what -- my rebate check DID show up in today's mail !!! Now- somebody please explain why they needed to send out the first letter ???????"
1347182,HeHooksHimself,2011-09-06 08:40:00,725,I got the same notice and the check was there the next day. That was a few weeks ago for a first week in June trip.
1347194,tv4fish,2011-09-06 09:13:00,2694,"Is that more ""government efficiency ????"
1347214,Bill Krejca,2011-09-06 11:16:00,6107,Re: Canadians in camp - There can quite a few in camps in Manitoba and Sask. The larger metro areas there are probably a factor. I've met some really great Canadian folks from these areas. Bill Krejca
1350720,Strickers cut,2011-09-18 18:38:00,33,does anyone have a link to the form that fisherman can use? I looked on the Canadian gov. website and it was very confusing.
1345865,Bill Krejca,2011-09-01 08:44:00,6107,Gotta love it! Bill Krejca
1345866,Skyraptor,2011-09-01 08:47:00,291,Sorry but the lodge does not need some 'slack' as you put it. Our trip was in August and they have clients during May-July and provided the same 'bad' receipt to them. Then when I requested a revised copy showing the services they seemed put-out that I was wasting their time to get a revised copy. Not knowing changing regulations is not an excuse when you want your clients business back. A lesson learned for me to make sure next time the lodge provides a good receipt before leaving. Choosing a different place for 2012.
1345889,Golden Eagle,2011-09-01 09:41:00,2642,My reply was only a suggestion. You know your lodge owner better than I.
1345890,v-bay gord,2011-09-01 09:43:00,3168,"The lodge where you stay should be interested in providing you with an eligible receipt since the money you can claim back is not insignificant. If they aren't interested in doing this then they are either misinformed on what they need to do, or too lazy to do it. Then again it is no money out of their pocket and perhaps it is just another service they choose not to provide. All it takes is showing an eligible ""package"" that includes accomodation and ONE other eligible service......and, YES, filletting your fish does count. Things are probably slow this year in getting rebates back due to the mail strike we had. ......and by the way here at VBL I take care of the paperwork and mail it in for my guests. It's the least I can do for having them spend their money with me."
1345898,FrankLeigh,2011-09-01 09:59:00,80,"This is an interesting topic. I didn't think our government was still doing that. It is a good idea to promote tourism, but probably only a small percentage of travellers know about it or bother with it.Do any of you guys know if the U.S. provides similar tax rebates? I travel to the U.S., from Canada, at least a couple of times each year, so if there are state or federal rebates available, it would be good to know."
1345914,Skyraptor,2011-09-01 10:33:00,291,"Good point V-bay, in my case the lodge was just lazy to provide me with the correct paperwork. It was only after I sent another request to them asking again for a corrected receipt or that they pay me the rebate due that I received a 'corrected' copy in the mail. They got a 'thumbs down' from me for that type of service, seemed they did not care because it was a after-the-fact that I had paid my bill. FrankLeigh, as far as I know the US does not provide any type of refund to foreign vistors. Minnesota does in fact no charge any tax on clothing that you purchase in the state of Minnesota."
1345924,Golden Eagle,2011-09-01 10:55:00,2642,Would it be too simple to have camp owners collect only applicable tax on fishermen with a nonresident license? That would leave out a lot of steps and save time for several of those involved.I'm fond of camp owners. I'm less than fond of government.
1345935,tv4fish,2011-09-01 11:43:00,2694,"I sure agree with you skyraptor -- I wouldn't cut them ANY slack - they ARE being lazy. Now - the camp that I stay at went the ""other extreme"" (John at Red Pine Lodge in Sioux Lookout). He revised his receipt so that it WOULD qualify for the rebate. Frankleigh: As said ^^^ -no rebate on your purchases down here, BUT -- you're not paying 15% to start with either."
1345944,HeHooksHimself,2011-09-01 12:25:00,725,"This rebate has been in effect for at least two years and my experience in 2010 was quite different than 2011. We spent roughly the same amount in both years. In 2010, the Canadian govt. reviewed my claim and cut it some 70% by simply stating that it had been reviewed and adjusted. I deposited in my Chase bank and they charged me about $6 to cash a $60 check. I was expecting over $200 and of course the other guys thought that would even us all up- you know how that goes. It literally cost me about $145 with no explanation. This year we returned to the same camp and told them about my rebate experience. They were a little perturbed because I was not the only one with this story, but I was assured that I should get back half of the HST, about $200. This year I did get that amount and my bank charged me $1.40 to cash it. More government is the solution!!"
1345982,FrankLeigh,2011-09-01 13:42:00,80,"Hey, Skyraptor and tv4fishThanks for the info on Minnesota's taxes. I have never had the pleasure of travelling there, but I have travelled to about 30 U.S. states, for both business and pleasure. Delaware was the only one that had no sales tax (that I am aware of). Also Pennsylvania had no tax on clothes, the last time that I was there.Most places that I have stayed, though, have taxes on hotel rooms of between 10 and 15 per cent. Rental cars, especially at airports, seem to be even higher. Hotel plus car should be in the same tax category as cabin plus boat. Accomodations and a vehicle usually account for a major percentage of the cost, when you travel, so they incur the most taxes on any trip.I would be happy to get back a portion of the taxes that I have spent on U.S. hotels and cars. Anyway, it would not stop me travelling, if I didn't.It sounds like our HST rebate program is a good idea to attract tourists but leaves something to be desired in terms of administration. I hope that a few dollars or bothersome paperwork does not deter Americans from coming to Ontario to fish. Getting even part of your taxes back, means that you receiving a discount, compared to the Canadian group in the next cabin.Just remember that old saying about "" a bad day fishing........"""
1345689,bellbuoy,2011-08-31 17:38:00,490,Got my GST rebate check from my trip earlier this year and deposited it at my Credit Union's ATM. Then today I get a call from the Credit Union and they tell me the want to charge me $25 to cash this check?!?! Anyone else experience this?
1345692,Bill Krejca,2011-08-31 18:02:00,6107,"No. Last year, my credit union did end up with a diferentional, as I would call it, maybe a week after I cashed the check. I don't remember whether it was a + or a -, but I believe it had to do with the exchange rate. It was a very small sum, maybe $1.50, or so. You could just wait until next year, and cash the check in Canada. Bill"
1345700,LIKEWALLEYE,2011-08-31 18:27:00,70,"This seems strange, i just called the canadian gov for the web site to print out a gst hst tax rebate form,( i informed him that i was a u.s resident). He told me they dont do the rebates anymore. They quit that april in 2007. I must be missing something. Can anyone give me more information if this information is false."
1345800,phishfearme,2011-09-01 06:20:00,1242,"most all banks charge some type of fee for this - either outright or blended in with the exchange rate - or both. it's a real cost to them. so, i'm taking mine back to canada next year to partially pay for the trip - the outfitter will cash it and credit it and there is no fee since it's canadian fund in a canadian bank. it may be worth more or less depending on the change of rates but i think this is better than a guaranteed loss. phish"
1345804,Jarbear,2011-09-01 06:30:00,24,"I went to the web page and found the form needed for the rebate. I am wondering how many guys file for the rebate. I have heard of this rebate, but never applied for it. After reading the requirements, it looks like one can apply for the rebate on tax paid for short stays, provided they spend a certain amount. I am wondering what the average rebate is for those that have applied. I will spend about $85 dollars in tax for my trip package next week. Can I put in a request for $85 bucks? Thanks"
1345806,Skywagon,2011-09-01 06:32:00,1106,"I find some checks up here have to be cashed within certain time limits, or they have to be re-issued. I have not noticied if the GOV checks are that way, but it might be worth looking into, or even sending it to your outfitter now, if you are going back next year. Just a thought."
1345816,tv4fish,2011-09-01 06:46:00,2694,"Jarbear: It is now the HST - not GST (surprise -- it's now a 15% ""combined"" tax).You can only get a rebate for 1/2 of what you paid. There ARE some ""qualifiers"" in order to get it also. I submitted a request back in the first of July - have not heard/seen anything yet. I'm not holding my breath either."
1345840,phishfearme,2011-09-01 07:52:00,1242,"in ontario, the HST (homoginized) is a combo of the old GST (federal goods and services - 7%) and the PST (provincial - 8%) - and you will now get back half of the HST (a much better deal than the previous 1/2 of the GST only) but you need at least 2 services provided and it must be clear on the receipt - for example a fly-in service and short term accomodations qualify. some outfitters will provide ""fillet services"" as a second service if you only have short term accomodations - i'd be leary of this one though - the gov will catch on sometime. i applied last year and got the rebate for our flyin trip and have again applied this year and am still waiting but optimistic. do a search and you'll find a previous thread with much more detail. phish"
1345855,Skyraptor,2011-09-01 08:23:00,291,"Went to Canada in August 2010 and filed my GST rebate and the Gov't rejected it because the lodge did not itemize the services enough for the Gov't. (It was a American Plan). Got the lodge to re-do the billing and re-submitted the form and then was sent a letter telling me that it would take 6-9 months for them to review. This past August finally got a check for 50% of the tax paid and took the check to my Credit Union. They deposited the amount in my checking account and then a week later noticed on-line that they took $1.59 for an 'Foreign Exchange' because it was a check from Canada. Was not happy with the CU for not telling or asking to withdraw those funds without my permission. They said they should of called to tell me. But just know that they will charge some fee to cash that check. My beef is with the lodge, you would think that they would know better and provide a detailed receipt showing all the services they provided that is acceptable for the Canadian Gov't. They sounded putout when I asked them to provide a more detailed receipt. Wonder how many of their other guests just didn't re-file after getting a letter back from the Gov't?"
1345860,Golden Eagle,2011-09-01 08:36:00,2642,I suggest cutting slack to lodge owners who have become victims of ever changing regulations handed down from government. Bad government knows no borders.
