Their main camp is across the road. Some of us on Walleye Central used to stay at Camp Kuha, which is located in the center of Tunnel Lake and unfortunately was sold to private owners that purchased those log cabins a few years back. Had the pleasure of visiting with another Walleye Central member (Gary B) from Zanesville, Ohio who I had met years back at Camp Kuha; as Gary also was at Grand Falls Camp last week. There were (4) of us, and the good news was that a large cabin opened up and the camp owners (Mike and Paulette) let us rent it for the cost of their smaller cabin. Bad news was that they only have two small docks in the cove, and only had one space for a boat (others were using the same docks) so my friends ended up pulling their rig every time they went out and Gary also pulled his Lund up on the rock shore in front of his cabin instead of having a dock (Mike really needs to add another dock in his cove). You can run electric (with your own cords) to the closest dock which we did so were able to use our on-board charger at night). Two of the guys with me came up from Toledo (father/son) and they fish bass - they had a great first few days until the cold front hit with high winds....still caught a few bass, but the bite was down. We walleye fished mainly with harnesses and trolled cranks...caught enough to eat (12"" - 15"") and had one large eye get off at the boat. My friend caught a nice 31"" pike and we caught a few other pike and SM Bass on the harnesses. Marked a lot of fish and bait fish, though only got a double once during the week (other than the day we bass fished early on and had some doubles that day). Bought a small box of crawlers from Cabela's in Dundee, and for the 1st time ever, had a box of dead crawlers when we opened them the next day at camp - I always check the flats at the store, but this time I didn't - on the way back we stopped at Cabela's and they did refund the cost. On the way back home my buddy commented that our trip was average for the fishing, which ain't all bad (ha) - no trophy fish (our group has caught SM Bass up to 7 lbs, an 18 lb pike and a 11-12 lb eye out of Tunnel over the years) this trip, but plenty of fish to eat and considering the weather and fronts that blew through during the week, not all bad. Our cabin was very clean, and Tunnel is a beautiful lake to fish - Grand Falls Camp has a good ramp to use at their cove and it is an easy drive from the Soo. A few trees were just starting to change colors, and very few bugs. As an aside, two good friends of mine were up at Island Ten Camp at Lady Lake Evelyn last week, and they reported basically the same type of fishing we encountered. Enough ""eater"" size eyes to eat, though no trophies brought in (except for 2 guys that brought in over $300 worth of chubs to use and that caught those guys some nice eyes - one over 30"", but if you didn't have chubs, it was eater sized eyes for the guys at that camp - my friends did better than most in camp, with the exception of those 2 guys that had the chubs). They said their log cabin was exceptional, and the food and service top shelf. Their camp boat was a 17' boat with a 25 hp outboard which ran fine for them (I will say they paid a tad more $$ last week than we did - ha). Rich B"
