We usually fly-in but this year with a lot of factors we are driving and going 3 to 4 weeks later than normal. Mostly fish with spinner rigs and minnows. I know we aren't going much later than we normally do but thought I'd see if there was anything major we should change going at the end of Sept vs late Aug/early Sept?Should be interesting either way going to a new body of water. It was nice going back to the same spots year in and year out and catching a lot of fish. But, am looking forward to finding new spots and fishing Lac Seul."

As I'm sure you already know, Lac Seul is huge and can get very rough. My best advice is to hire a guide for a couple days. Good luck."
