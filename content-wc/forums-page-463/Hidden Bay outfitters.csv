1349090,willy0183,2011-09-12 19:54:00,11,Looking at Hidden Bay outfitters for a fly-in next year. From replys from a previous post they come highly recommended. I was wondering how many of you guys have been there and how was your trip? What lake did you stay at? Did you go back or would you? It is a lot of money to go and wanted to get some more input. Thanks

It may be on the pricey side, but they do have thier food plan, and they offer a nights stay before your trip. The last couple of summers they have offered reduced rates for late season trips, that might help bring the price down. I have had a couple of e-mails from them, they seem willing to help provide for a good trip!"
