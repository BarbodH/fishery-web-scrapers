1349227,Bill Krejca,2011-09-13 08:37:00,6107,"Aaron, I never caught any myself. Here's the story: We carried/dragged our canoes through the 5 portages after I had read an article in a magazine that is no longer published. The article told about the terrific smallmouth and muskie fishing in the lake. We camped for a few days south east of the portage into the lake. After setting up camp, we were visited by a French-Canadian who managed a fly-in camp across from our camp site, for Westinghouse, who used it as a perk for their big buck customers. The guy, who also guided, said there were some huge walleyes in the lake, and a few lake trout. As I remember, the walleyes were pretty much concentrated in the sort of north west part of the lake (north of the ""entrance"" portage). This was a long time ago, I remember hearing that the Westinghouse camp closed up some time ago. One really interesting memory I have of the lake, besides the great bass fishing, was drifting into bays and seeing fish cruising around, like one can commonly experience with pike sightings, except the fish were all muskies! A fun lake to fish, and still a great one to be on, as I am told! Bill Krejca"
1349295,Aaron-IN,2011-09-13 12:16:00,500,"Bill,Well, there aren't supposed to be any lake trout in Big Sand lake at Minaki either but I caught one a few years ago right after ice out so I suppose there could also be walleye in Kish, it certainly looks like it could support walleye. I do remember flying into Kish with my father when I was a kid, there were two older gentlemen on the plane with us being flown into another lake. One of the guys mentioned Kish having walleye in it as if he had first hand knowledge. As previously mentioned, Kish is a great Musky lake as well, in fact the largest musky I've ever seen caught was in Kish.Aaron"
1350624,GNO,2011-09-18 11:06:00,153,My family operated an outpost on Kish for years and no one ever caught any walleyes there. Also talk with many of the old timers in the area that have fished all the lakes in this area over the years and never once heard any mention of walleyes in Kishkutena. A smalll lake called Little Kishkutena has walleyes and is nearby. Maybe that is where the confusion is.
1347340,Ten Horse Johnson,2011-09-06 17:59:00,235,"I'm new to this site. I've browsed some old threads and saw people discussing smallmouth, so I hope I'm not out of line in bringing this topic up again on a walleye website.I want to book a Canadian fly-in trip to a lake that is good for smallmouth. By good, I'm referring to a lake where someone with moderate smallmouth experience can catch 35 to 40 fish per person per day on average (7 to 8 hours of fishing), with a shot at over 50 on a good day. I'm not interested in a lake where you have to weed through a dozen 10 inchers just to get one in the 2 to 3 lb range. Bonus walleyes are a plus (even if on a portage lake).I'm considering Rex Lake through Halley's Camps. Does anyone have any experience on this lake, or perhaps have any other recommendations?"
1347424,joeman79,2011-09-06 23:08:00,417,"Check out Big North Lodge near Minaki, they have a Fly in Lake, Roger Lake and there is Great Smallie fishing and many fish 16-19 inches. I think it would be a great choice. Great cabins, great service, nice boats. Alex and Pat are great hosts I highly recommend them. Also good Walleye fishing. Plus the Smallmouth fishing is very good in the Minaki area."
1347527,Ten Horse Johnson,2011-09-07 10:35:00,235,"Thanks, joeman. My understanding is that there are multiple outposts in the same area on Roger that other parties may be using. Is that the case?"
1347651,lassh,2011-09-07 17:04:00,553,"Try Berry Lake with True North outfitters. Excellent smallies on Berry and a portage lake. Only cabin on lake. Fly out of Clearwater Lake near Emo, Ontario. Been there twice and had good fishing."
1347749,joeman79,2011-09-07 23:40:00,417,I sent you a pm
1347869,Aaron-IN,2011-09-08 10:19:00,500,"I've done a number of smallmouth fly-ins over the years (including REX). Rex is an outstanding smallmouth lake and would fit what you are looking for. Having said that, my favorite lake of all time is Kishkutena (Kish), it's a short flight from Nestor Falls. I had my best week fishing ever on this lake. What is unique about this lake is that it's an outstanding Musky fishery as well (sorry, no walleye). If I'm not mistaken Tinker's has a cabin on that lake, the outfitter we used the last time no longer is doing business. You might call Northwest Flying service, they should be able to help you out."
1348406,Hawker,2011-09-10 06:19:00,3967,"Another +1 for Kish! Truly a great smallie lake and as already stated, a great musky lake as well. Good numbers of lake trout there too, but no eyes. While there are several outpost cabins on Kish, we have never seen more than a couple of other boats on the water when we have been there. We use Young's Wilderness Camp who have a cabin that will sleep up to 8, 4 boats, and located at what I feel like is the prime spot on the lake for targeting all three species without having to run all over the lake. Can't say enough good about Kish other than there are no eyes!!"
1348591,Fisherman Ted,2011-09-10 22:46:00,461,I sent you a PM regarding excellent smallmouth fishing. Fisherman Ted
1348602,Bill Krejca,2011-09-11 05:18:00,6107,"I took the 5 portages into Kish and camped some 40 years ago. Very good smallmouth and muskie fishing. There are some walleyes in the lake, but they are very elusive; also there are a few lake trout, presence of these species shared with me by a guide we talked with at the lake. Bill Krejca"
1349122,GNO,2011-09-12 22:06:00,153,"There are no walleyes in Kishkutena, you must be thinking of a different lake."
