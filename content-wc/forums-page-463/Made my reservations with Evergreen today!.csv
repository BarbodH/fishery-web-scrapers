I just reserved a cabin for the last week of July and the first week of August.I have a friend that has never fished walleyes in Canada before,let alone Lac Seul.I'm working on him to commit to another week,the second week of August also.He is wearing down.He's a good fisherman.I got him going pulling crankbaits on Oahe this summer.He's so excited about the Lac Seul trip he's buying canned goods already!It will be interesting between now and the end of July.Bill"
