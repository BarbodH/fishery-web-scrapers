Our hosts Cheryl and Marcel at Birch Dale Lodge treated us like family as we had our best year ever, can't wait till next year."
1338087,NARDA 1,2011-08-07 10:31:00,636,I know it's been hot up there but how has the fishing been up on the north end? I leave in 30 days
1338097,kennedyrec,2011-08-07 11:13:00,108,leaving Friday for the first time to Eagle. Would also like to hear some reports.
1338138,v-bay gord,2011-08-07 14:45:00,3168,"Fishing has been good. Walleyes are being caught off mid lake humps and deeper structure.....18-25'......crawlers or minnows have been effective. There is still a shallow cabbage bite for walleye especially in the evening. We've had some very nice walleye caught twitching Husky Jerks or smaller muskie baits through thick cabbage. There is also a lot of cisco activity with schools of walleye chasing these at various depths.........we've had some folk really tie into them using crank baits and watching for the feeding birds/ jumping ciscoes scenario. Right time, right place kind of deal. Muskie fishing has been great.......most activity seems to be in the cabbage. Northerns seem to be relating to the cabbage as well. All in all last week was very good in my opinion. Things will be right on track for your group Narda come September!"
1338278,NARDA 1,2011-08-08 06:38:00,636,"Thanks Gord, can't wait to get up there. I've seen some pictures of fish caught, especially the Musky WOW!!!!!!"
1338554,Eyes_R_Us,2011-08-08 20:39:00,66,"I was on Eagle last week and the fishing was fantastic. We only fished walleyes and mostly on reefs. We fished a well known 30ft flat and enjoyed watching them slam the ciscos. I wish I would have thought of throwing cranks like V-bay Gord mentioned - I think that would have been effective. I threw out a zera spook a few times but didn't work it too hard. The weather was windy and calm, hot and not so hot, cloudy and clear and we had a pretty good storm go through one morning at sunrise. The fishing was consistent through it all. I think you are going to be happy with your experience on Eagle."
1338635,v-bay gord,2011-08-09 07:34:00,3168,"Eyes.........our guests caught them trolling cranks, not casting them.....but perhaps that would have worked too. Sounds like you had some great fishing. I'm sure the many years you have logged fishing Eagle Lake are paying off.....there is nothing better than experience to produce great results."
1338836,Guest,2011-08-09 18:27:00,0,"I fished the west arm of Eagle Lake the last week of july and they seemed to bite the most on a black hooked lindy rig with mainly leeches but some minnows to. Jigging did work sometimes mainly on the shallower rock reefs (16-22 ft) and I tried pink, yellow, orange, and gold hooked lindy rigs but didnt catch hardly anything with those."
1348624,potsie225,2011-09-11 07:31:00,41,"Good luck. One of our guys said it was his worst week fishing in Ontario ever. We did have 2 fish frys, but did not bring home our limit for 6 guys for walleye. Weather was hot, one day was 86, surface water temp was 70, wind was not a factor. We fished alot with minnows, drifting and back trolling. If you have interent while your there, I will try and give you more info. Tight lines and safe trip, Doug"
1348655,v-bay gord,2011-09-11 09:30:00,3168,"Another post ""What a difference in fishing"" kind of applies here. I won't be glib and say the fishing was great last week.....obviously not for everyone. I think conditions are such right now that there are not as many successful patterns that seem to be working. That being said, one pattern that was working was bottom bouncing with crawler harness's and spinners. The fish were dispersed and it was good to be able to cover some ground. Using the proper techniques (long leaders on the harness's and good size blades.....right depths and speed) and using the locator to your advantage....it was a pretty successful week from my perspective. Experience on a lake is crucial....as is really knowing how to fish walleyes using a variety of techniques. This is not a shot at you Doug, but perhaps a few pointers might have made a big difference in your recent trip........there is always something new to learn, no matter how long we've been at it."
1348998,Pete eer,2011-09-12 15:06:00,14,"Just returned from the West Arm of Eagle lake. The weather was hot and the winds were mostly calm, but the fishing was still very good. We cought walleys off reefs in 28 to 32 feet on lindy rig and a minnow. The biggest walley was 28 and the biggest northern was 42. The only complaint other than to hot was it was tough to catch shore lunch as most were over the min slot. Hope the fishing continues good."
