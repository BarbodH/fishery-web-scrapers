The night we discovered the ""stealer"" was a tough night for sleeping.Schnoodle ""Dace Sushi"" pharts are horrendous stinky.She would jump up on top of my fathers sleeping bag to sleep by him them let fly.He would wake up cussing then the foul green cloud would drift my way.Bad Dog,Bad Dog! The next spring I was underneath the back end of my boat making sure the wires to the battery were OK when I found a dried shriveled up Dace from the trip.I said ""Oh Boy a Schnoodle treat,minnow jerky"",My father said no way she won't eat it.Wrong!!! Crunch,crunch,gulp with much lip licking.Bill"

Just one more reason why trip to Canada are special!"
