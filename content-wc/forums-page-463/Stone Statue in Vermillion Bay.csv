I believe that years ago this place was known as Bratland's. I know its Native Tribe related. Can anyone clear the air about this? The postal clerk in Ear Falls tried, but I had walleye on the brain, so I wasn't paying attention. I believe its the same reason that we find piles of stones along the highway."

1351065,Hawkfan,2011-09-19 20:25:00,237,I think this is what you are talking about.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuksuk
1351066,Campcountry,2011-09-19 20:26:00,164,You beat me to it by one minute
1351070,v-bay gord,2011-09-19 20:35:00,3168,"Actually, I was told by a ""reliable source"" that the piles along the highway are in fact stashes of open bottles of liquor left by returning US citizens on the way home from fishing. Since you can't bring home open bottles these are stashed and marked by the rock piles for the return trip back the following year. So, like the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow, you may find a half opened bottle of Jack Daniels by those piles...... Check it out!"

1351087,Hawkfan,2011-09-19 21:12:00,237,We usually meet at my brother's house NW of the twin cities on the way up north. A couple years ago he moved to a new house we hadn't been to yet. We took his directions and noticed our last few turns were marked by little rock piles on the side of the road. We got a kick out of it. But now when we go up in a week it's going to take us forever to get there. There are a lot of rock piles to check for booze. Thanks Gord!
