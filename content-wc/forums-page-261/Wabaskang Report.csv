4105385,JIGSTER,2015-08-05 14:52:00,30,"Well we had an interesting trip to Wabaskang. Broke a leaf spring on the way up, cost us 10 hrs to locate parts and get back on the road. As it always seems the case mine wasnt the ""common"" size. lol Any how the weather ranged from 92 and no wind to 62, rain, and 40 mph wind! We had our best luck at the ""big lake"" around devils point and doe island. Seemed like everywhere on the lake for walleyes the smaller fish were right at 16 ft. and the bigger fish were at 20-22 ft. Not many bigger fish but did get a 26,25,24,23 and 8-10 fish between 20-22"". All fish over 20"" came from deeper than 20 ft. Didnt spend much time fishing weeds. Didnt catch any good northerns but didnt really fish for them either. Only spent a couple hours perch fishing and only found small fish, nothing over 8"".Construction was light and the border crossing extremely easy both ways."
4105577,sheepman,2015-08-05 16:24:00,98,Jigster...sounds like the Perch were few and far between...where did you try for them? Hope the weather is better in a week.
4106585,JIGSTER,2015-08-06 06:24:00,30,"We stayed at Kingfisher, we did most of our perch fishing in that area and inside the first narrows near Sleepy Dog Resort. Mostly fishing for perch when the wind was blowing hard on the bigger lakes. Didn't really give it a good hard effort. Good luck!!"
4106761,Big Mike,2015-08-06 07:31:00,35,Thanks for the report. I'm headed back up real soon. The latest report I've heard is that the shallow bite is starting to tail off (except for late evening) and fish are moving out to the deep structure...exactly like you stated. I will give a report when I return...
