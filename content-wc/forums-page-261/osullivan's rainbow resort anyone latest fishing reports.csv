It got pretty good the remainder of the week, lake was down 3 ft, less weeds than normal. This is the first year that we didn't get a bunch of 25-26"", but did well up to 22"". We could have caught 25 walleyes or more /person, but didn't stay in the same area very long, looking more for the big mommas. We also didn't ever make a complete day of it, part of the fun is not making an endurance activity out of it. This was about the 10th year going to O""S Rainbow, we know there are some large fish in there, a 32"" was released the week before we got there. We did catch more pike than normal, largest was 5-6lbs, but we didn't target them at all. If we had, we would have used larger crankbaits and would have fished deeper, but no one got really excited about targeting them. It is a good lake, and the wilderness is all around you. You can email me at [email protected] if you want to discuss more. Bill"
