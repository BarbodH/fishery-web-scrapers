4109713,Guest,2015-08-07 10:37:00,0,"No they don't !!! only the MNR states the rights and laws, anything else from lodges has no legal standing and quite frankly they would not be able to legally remove you from their lodge"
4106665,BreezyPoint,2015-08-06 07:08:00,1581,"This is a tough call, but as one poster suggested, probably against game laws to waste the fish. After hearing this story, I think if I ever went to a place with those rules, I would have a conversation up front with the lodge owner, to be clear on his expectations. I would hate to waste the fish. Frank"
4106873,forgop,2015-08-06 07:59:00,880,"I'd take the lodge ""rules"" as nothing more than suggestions/requests. If it were me and it would result in a law being violated, I'm going to cover my own butt."
4106961,zman8701,2015-08-06 08:25:00,100,Any time I go to a new lodge I always ask up front if they have any special camp rules that differ from MNR regulations. If I think they are to unreasonable I don't book. I'm not out to rape any system I fish but some Lodge owners go a little over board.
4107169,MrSimon,2015-08-06 09:29:00,922,"One thing I don't like about this particular lodge is that they use the word ""mandatory"" on their website when it comes to their camp-imposed restrictions. And nowhere do they actually explain that their rules go above and beyond the law. They also don't advertise anywhere what happens if you break their rule ... although if you ask them in person they say that you won't be welcome back and you might be asked to leave. Essentially, they have carefully written their website to lead guests to believe that their camp rules are actually the law. And when you check in, they tell you the rules as if they are the law. While I like their rules and appreciate their commitment to conservation, I think they are being a little sneaky about it."
4107529,Frankm,2015-08-06 12:00:00,154,"Very simple for me. If a lodge thinks they are above the law with their 'own' rules. That is not a lodge I would ever stay at. Canada has whats called the MNR that is in charge of all the fishing regulations. They do studies etc and set limits based on their findings. In my opinion they are strict enough with minimum size and slot limits. As you know its a major ordeal setting up and going on a trip to CA. Passport, border crossing, long drive etc. Last place I would go would be a place with an owner on a power trip. No need for that when I'm on vacation. I follow the rules and like every sportsman set my own personal limits. Biggest problem I've seen in Canada is cheating. I've seen fisherman using more than one rod, keeping slot fish, having more in possession than allowed. I stayed and Ciancis for years and one year the warden busted just about every cabin at the lodge next door. Pretty shocking when I heard that. In WI a lot of the fishing guides like to have rules in their boat. Again very simple not a guide I would hire. If the law states I can keep a pike up to 27.5"" if I catch a 27"" I'm keeping it. Just my opinion."
4107537,tparker,2015-08-06 12:10:00,100,"Shellback, Was the lodge you were at up north in zone 1? Most of western Ontario is in zones 2,4, or 5. I don't believe a 32"" pike is legal to keep in those zones."
4107553,Shellback,2015-08-06 12:21:00,8083,"Zone 7, none over 33.9""."
4107577,tparker,2015-08-06 12:23:00,100,Got it.
4107641,Shellback,2015-08-06 12:40:00,8083,"I knew the camp rules before I left and didn't have a problem with them. I've spent 3 weeks fishing Canada this year so far, and am going back for at least 2 more. So far I have kept a 1/2 dozen 10"" perch and 2 walleyes under 17 inches. I'm certainly not a meat hunter, but I don't like to waste fish either. There was a sign at the lodge stating that you would be told to leave if caught keeping fish out of their slot limit. I understand lodges concerned with conservation, and wanting to improve fishing, but maybe they are over stepping their bounds. Here in the states, there can be private property preserves where fish and game is owned by the property owner, and they can make their own rules. Making up your own rules to fish on public lands, seems like over stepping the law. Hated to release a dead fish, but in reality, I'm sure it didn't go to waste, something had a meal off it."
4107809,SinOrSwim,2015-08-06 14:13:00,1528,"The lodge has the rights on those lakes. I'd rather go to a lodge that sets limits like that. If someone is legally able to take ONE big fish and a whole bunch of people do so, there are obviously less big fish to catch. I'd rather catch a big one than a bunch of small ones. Hawk lake lodge is catch and release only. I'm assuming that is a lodge rule. But, the chances of catching a trophy walleye there are much higher than other places. So, I spend the money to go there. Just because the MNR says you can keep one trophy fish doesn't mean you have to. Legally or not. Thats the great thing about all these different places. You can find something for everyone. If catching 100 fish is your thing..........so be it. I'd rther catch 2 fish and both be big. Just my preference."
4105241,Shellback,2015-08-05 14:00:00,8083,"According to ON regs, you aren't supposed to waste fish and game. A couple weeks ago I fished a lodge in western Ontario. They recommended light action rods and 6# test line for walleye. They had their own set of limits, no walleye 18 inches or over could be kept. Any pike over 26 inches couldn't be kept. While walleye fishing with light tackle I deep hooked a 32 inch pike. It was wore out when I got it to the boat and after getting the deep hook out, I spent close to 30 minutes trying to revive with no luck. Following the lodge rules, ( being kicked out keeping an undersize fish) I finally had to let it float away belly up. A gull soon had it. ON laws about wasting game has me wondering, that was a legal pike to keep according to ON regs, but basically I had to waste it due to lodge rules. I'd have to think ON rules trump lodge rules. So what's the correct answer for the fish in question, keep it and risk being asked to leave, or waste the legal size fish?"
4105257,Golden Eagle,2015-08-05 14:04:00,2642,"If it were acceptable to keep injured fish, the number of injured fish would increase a bunch. Wish you would have been able to observe an eagle grabbing your fish instead of a gull. With that size fish an eagle might have used all the runway when taking it to his babies and have to circle to gain altitude. They know how."
4105273,Jimmy Jig,2015-08-05 14:11:00,1905,Don't know about camp rules versus DNR rules but if a warden had of seen you do that you would get a ticket! And I woudn't blame the warden.
4105297,Lovetofish,2015-08-05 14:16:00,458,I cut the line.
4105305,MrSimon,2015-08-05 14:17:00,922,"That's a tough call. But knowing those particular lodge owners, I think they would have understood and supported you if you kept the fish and quietly let them know what happened. Their rule is designed to promote catch and release and preserve an environment of conservation at their lodge. But they are reasonable people as well and most likely would see that you were doing everything in your power to adhere to their restrictions. Personally I support and appreciate lodges that go even further toward conservation than the provincial laws ...... but it does create sticky situations like the one you were in."
4105345,ftfarms,2015-08-05 14:38:00,444,"That's right cut the line leave the hook in gut. He will be fine. Don't ever try to get it out if it's that deep. I caught a 261/2"" walleye that had a line sticking out of his mouth. I cut it a little shorter and released it. You could tell the line and hook had been there a while. So the fish was really fat and still feeding appeared the fish was doing fine."
4105361,SinOrSwim,2015-08-05 14:42:00,1528,That is a tough call. I'd probably let it go just like you did.
4106233,Yaba,2015-08-05 20:56:00,88,"Lodge owners implement those rules to help maintain the fish population, size and quality...it goes above and beyond MNR limits. The fish you describe sounds legal, so you could have kept it despite lodge rules. However the lodge is only trying to protect its future fishery. Next time it would be better to just cut the line."
4106369,roscoe33,2015-08-05 23:11:00,653,"I would not have dumped it if it was a legal fish where you were fishing. I appreciate and follow the lodge invoked rules, but not gonna waste a fish like that. One option would be to clean it in the boat, stick it in a bag and under your coat, package it in your cabin. No one need know about it. What did the lodge owner say when you told him this story?"
4106553,Shellback,2015-08-06 06:16:00,8083,"The fish was caught on a stickbait, so cutting the line wasn't exactly an option. The hook removal really didn't take much time, but the fish was spent from the fight. Water temp was 70, so that didn't help. Lodge owner more or less shrugged her shoulders when I told her the story. Keeping with their policy of releasing trophy fish, I'm sure she wouldn't have said to keep it. We all realize what would happen if they allowed you to keep any dying fish. Anyhow, it's a done deal, fishing and hunting is a deadly business, sometimes the outcome isn't what you'd like. ."
