4108313,fishron,2015-08-06 18:53:00,317,"I have to agree with outdoorsron. After many shore lunches, I've come to the conclusion that a pan full of wonderful walleye filets, in a wonderful setting of the far north, taste just as good fifty feet from your cabin, cleaning station, and outhouse."
4108433,Slab Seeker,2015-08-06 19:50:00,14,now that's what I was looking for! Thanks For the pics guys
4108481,jkaup,2015-08-06 20:16:00,56,"If you ever make it to Kenoji lake, there is an awesome lunch spot north of camp. Has a datum marker from the 1920s. Rocks for fire already set . Parking for boats and is elevated about 10ft above the water. I'll look for a pic."
4108945,SinOrSwim,2015-08-07 06:50:00,1528,These aren't great pictures but this will make you hungry. One with the fried tortilla shell
4109209,Jakerides,2015-08-07 08:18:00,223,"Thats why I love Rainy Lake, lots of shore lunch spots. All have fire rings, picnic tables, and a latrine. Some even have small docks. Many have sand beachs that are great for a cooling off dip. And catching fish for lunch never seems to be a problem. Best of all it's in the U.S.A. ( well a big part of it is). And for those over 65 a hospital that excepts medicare and your insurance is very close by, 10 to 25 miles depending where you are on the lake."
4109281,Slab Seeker,2015-08-07 08:33:00,14,I am sensing there will be a few additions/changes to our shore lunch menu next time. The fried tortilla looks very tasty.
4109417,SinOrSwim,2015-08-07 09:02:00,1528,"We have been going up for 20+ years. We will typically take a couple new batters with us to ""test"". But, every year it isn't even close. The favorite is Zatarains seasoned fish fri. They have a ton of different kinds so you have to make sure it is the ""seasoned"" fish fri. A couple years ago we had a guide with us. We did a combination shore lunch since we had a big group. His for those of us being guided and ours since we had so many people. We all just teamed up to do stuff. He said he was a little taken aback because his fish wasn't really getting eaten. Then, tasted ours. He absolutely loved it. It's the batter. No more, no less. You can find it in SOME grocery stores too. But, like I said you have to be careful whether you just get the brand zatarains or the specific kind of zatarains.http://www.mccormick.com/Zatarains/P...soned-Fish-Fri"
4106649,Slab Seeker,2015-08-06 07:04:00,14,We aren't heading North this year so I have to live vicariously through posts on this forum. Who's got pics/descriptions of their best Shore Lunch spots? We fished Nungesser last year and need to do a better job of planning that part. We ended up pulling in to whatever was closest when a short drive might have been a little better area. Thanks for sharing.
4106689,johnboat,2015-08-06 07:17:00,2014,A sandy beach is always a good place to start.
4106785,SinOrSwim,2015-08-06 07:35:00,1528,"Sandy beach is okay but I think messy. I'd rather have an island or a point that has little crevices to pull the nose of the boat in. Makes getting in and out easy and you don't get sand in the boat. Plus, cleaning a fish can be done on the rocks or using an oar a lot easier than on the sand. It is just a lot cleaner. Having a big area of flat granite with some boulders around to sit on too. An area that has areas that are open for wind an trees to block the wind for the cooker too. Also you don't get sand blasted when you take off from all the sand that inevitably gets in teh boat and then blows back at the driver when you get up on plane. Clean the fish, cut in strips or chunks. Batter, fry and put in a tortilla with a little lettuce, onion, tomato and bacon. Top with our baja sauce we take with for baja walleye tacos. OMG. about another month and that will be happening"
4106825,Hawkfan,2015-08-06 07:43:00,237,"A lot of lakes will have spots that are fan favorites already set up. Keep an eye out on the trip out for points and islands with the stacks of rocks for a fire pit and/or rocks set up for places to sit. We used to fly in and even the low traffic on that lake, there were spots you could tell people regularly did shore lunch. Most were like what SOS described, point or island with good drop off, ample boat parking and an area with a wind block.We go to Lac Seul now and Manitoba point is about ideal because one side is almost always blocked by the one line of trees to make for easy parking and not messing with the fire. It would b even better if it wasn't all beach so you didn't get sand all over your boat and in your face."
4106881,Slab Seeker,2015-08-06 08:01:00,14,We had always brought a loaf of bread but I like the fish taco idea. Alot less room to pack than the bread that sometimes gets crushed.
4106921,SinOrSwim,2015-08-06 08:20:00,1528,"This is exactly why we started. Buns were a pain in the neck. We first started doing just fish planks with beans etc. then moved to fish sandwiches and then to the tortillas. They travel much better. Then, it sort of morphed into the fish tacos. You can also fry the tortilla, folding it over with a tong and make a crunchier shell. Those are really good. Takes a lot more time if you have a big group like we typically do though."

4108137,outdoorsron,2015-08-06 17:07:00,843,"Hello: We used to do the shore lunches but now go back to the cabin for fish lunches. A lot easier to do with the same results. Maybe not as rustic. A nice place to clean fish, cook, sit and eat, bathroom facilities available. I hear some fishermen have even napped after lunch. Good Luck. O - R"
4108257,walleye88ia,2015-08-06 18:37:00,35,"hi Slab Seeker.I am also from central Iowa. I love Nungesser lake. when you select a spot for shore lunch,make sure waves are not coming towards you. your boat(s) may fill up with water.have a terriffic trip!!!"
4108273,Live to jig,2015-08-06 18:40:00,159,"This lunch spot is 30' up on a perfect Island with a great view and breeze. I Have access to McD's McRibs patties, so I cook them over a open fire with with BBQ sauce and soft buns with beans... seems to go over very well"
