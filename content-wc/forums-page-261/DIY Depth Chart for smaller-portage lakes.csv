The lodge we go to has a walleye portage lake we expect to spend a fair amount of time at this fall. We have a decent map of the lake but it has no depth information. The lake is small Â– maybe 1.5 or 2 miles long and about a mile wide at the widest. We have fished this lake many times in the spring but never in the fall. It occurred to me that we could try to create a depth map of the lake using our depth finder, and that this might help us find fish that week and also in the future. But I'm guessing this would also require a fair amount of effort. The way I assume we would do it would be to print out a bunch of copies of the lake map and mark them up in pencil as we're on the water, and then try to create sort of a master map at the end of the week. Granted we would have the depth finder, so we would know the depth at any particular spot, but not how it relates to the rest of the lake; not the big picture. We'd know it's 10 feet deep where we're at but we would not know that 20 yards away, it drops off to 20 feet or that there is a major hump that could hold a big school of fish 100 yards away. Has anyone tried to make their own map like this, and what did you learn in the process? Was it worth the effort, or not really? Thanks in advance for your two cents (especially if you've tried this before!)- Steve"

4097945,bthomas3333,2015-08-03 09:01:00,465,Yep. I was going to say there is technology to do that. Whether I would want to pay for a new depthfinder then cut it up to make it portable and carry it into a portage lake is another thing. I would hate to lose bait in the zone time making maps but maybe I think too short term.B-
