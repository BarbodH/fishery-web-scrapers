4111570,Hump,2015-08-08 08:16:00,578,"Adventure Sports Outdoors and click on the show ""Fishing Lac Seul"". Notice that this group is the only one in camp. an outhouse by one of the camps. Mostly small northerns. I rarely see anyone fish where this group did, by the Chinese Rock. This camp has now been sold to a great family. I'm sure they will bring it up to standards."
