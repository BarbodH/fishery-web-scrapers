4099241,Guest,2015-08-03 16:30:00,0,"Our group has stayed at Gold Pines Camp and find the owners very friendly and the price seems a bit lower than other resorts but, I'm curious about how good the fishing is at some of the other named resorts? Because of my 76 year old Dad we usually stay within 5 miles of the resort and while we catch wallleyes( just got back Saturday) most boats scream by us from Evergreen, Goose Bay and Gold Pines for Steamboat Bay or further which is too far of a boat ride for my Dad, especially with last week's winds of 25mph and more( the lake was ROUGH, even with my 18' Navigator). While it's hard to complain about catching 6-10 walleyes over 20"" a day along with numerous eaters, maybe other resorts are closer to even better fishing? Not disappointed in Gold Pines but maybe there are better options? Thoughts?"
4099873,MikeinMN,2015-08-03 19:49:00,190,"Our group has stayed at Gawley's Little Beaver resort near Ear Falls for around 10 years now. It's a little smaller than most with only 3 cabins. Super clean cabins, grounds, and fish house, free unlimited ice, and top notch owners. I also think it's on the less expensive end of resorts in that area. The Ear Falls area is what it is, I will stay at Gawley's until either I can afford SWW, or somebody builds an affordable resort on Manitoba Point."
4100169,Aspencreek,2015-08-03 22:03:00,2911,"Badger....there is good reason those boats are heading past you to points further south. Although what you are catching seems adequate to you, I and many others have done that in a couple hours in the spots further down lake. If you have to restrict yourself to your area so be it. But camps like Onaway, Lac Seul Lodge, & Fisherman's Cove are situated in much more prime water that gives you many more options on where to go and explore."
4100529,ftfarms,2015-08-04 06:39:00,444,If you go before 1st of July I'd stay at whitewing. If your going in the summer I'd stay at any of those mentioned by aspencreek plus scoutbay resort. We used to go to whitewing first week of june and down in scoutbay in the summer. Worked well for us.
4103457,Guest,2015-08-04 20:16:00,0,"Aspencreek, how far away from your resort do you travel to get to your better areas? While I would venture further if the fishing was much better, my Dad simply can't take the pounding of the rough water on windy days( and last week was VERY hard on his back and such and we stayed behind numerous islands to stay out of the rolling whitecaps) And to be honest, it seemed like we did as well as others in camp, we joked that on Monday we had 9 20""+ walleyes before 9am, so it's not like we weren't catching fish. Also, how much boat traffic do you deal with? With most boats headed to Steamboat, we have several spots to ourselves which is relaxing, instead of fighting for the ""perfect spot"". I'm intrigued by other resorts closer to better fishing but I have to consider our entire group should we try elsewhere, we've been to Gold Pines 4 times now and have several ""spots"" we've had success at and I don't know how patient my Dad would be trying to locate fish. Thanks for your advice !!"
4103625,Aspencreek,2015-08-04 21:57:00,2911,"I stay at Onaway. It is located in Scout Bay, a decent sized area with easy access to the Bay of Islands. When the weather is bad and the Lake turns ugly I stay close to home too, it's just that in the Scout Bay/Scout Lake/Bay of Islands area we have many more spots to get to and stay out of the wind and waves. And when the Lake is mad, fishing generally is not the best and nobody is catching much. But when the lake is calm it is easy for us to get to Manitoba Pt, Stoney Pt, South Islet, MacKenzie, the sand banks, etc. etc. To get to those prime spots from up in Ear Falls it is a HAUL. And when the lake turns ugly it can be a really LONG and back breaking trip. You talk about Steamboat being your limit or close to it, you aren't even to the Bay of Islands yet, Manitoba Pt is another hour by camp boat, and MacKenzie and the sand banks are a good 30-45 min depending on waves! And you get to negotiate Shanty Narrows, (not my favorite place, for eluding the underwater obstacles).That said, the boat traffic is getting more and more each year, at least that's what I think. And a lot of that traffic is coming from the Ear Falls area, it's amazing how many boats from Evergreen or Goose bay I see around MacKenzie and Manitoba. That has to be a 2 hour ride one way. From Onaway I can get to MacKenzie in 30 min, Manitoba in 40. But I would rather not fish around too many other boats, so I do a lot of exploring. Trying new spots, finding hidden gems, getting away from the crowd. I'm fishing but numbers are not my thing. When I find a ""secret spot"" that produces, that is my reward, and I have several.PM message me, we can talk more."
4105817,yoopertrout,2015-08-05 18:45:00,1172,"Last year my wife and I did a fly out with Kabeelo and loved it. We asked for a mostly walleye lake. We caught lots of walleyes to 27 1/2"". We didn't target northern much, but caught some to 40"". The whole operation was run extremely smoothly. The cabin was nice, clean and well equipped. I highly recommend Kabeelo."
4106793,worthsr,2015-08-06 07:35:00,52,"One more vote for Lac Seul Lodge, great people, great cabins, great boats and great fishing."
4106937,eyegator,2015-08-06 08:21:00,29,"Which outpost did you use with Kabeelo? We went up there about a month ago and they did a great job. Fishing above average, but nothing out of this world. We caught mainly walleyes up to 25in and northern up to 35in. We were on Betty Lake. The best part of Kabeelo is the level of service. They will do everything to make sure you are happy."
4097145,btyreprich,2015-08-03 04:27:00,1067,"Looking for recommendations on lodges on Lac Seul in the Ear Falls area. We are at a camp in this area now that might not be a match for our group. As long as we are in the area, our thoughts are to visit one or two recommended camps on our way home this Saturday. Thanks for the input."
4097177,wallydave,2015-08-03 05:05:00,2151,"I have fished out of Goose Bay for years, great boats, docks, and the cabins have been kept up. Just a satisfied customer.PM me if you have any questions."
4097257,Stringbean,2015-08-03 05:39:00,279,"As long as you are in the area, stop over at Gold Pines Camp. Stop in and say hi to Bill and Helen, Peter and Christa. We had never been disappointed there. Just find the intersection in Ear Falls where the 4 season sport shop is located and take that road (Hwy 657) to the very end."
4097289,WalleyeWally28,2015-08-03 06:08:00,298,Whitewing Resort. Headed there Friday for my third trip this summer.
4097393,vaquero01,2015-08-03 06:35:00,101,"Check it out online and stop by. New cabins, good boats and motors, good owners."
4097409,Yaba,2015-08-03 06:37:00,88,"Plenty of good resorts just south of Ear Fall on Lac Seul. Onaway and Fishermens cove are on Scout bay....Fishing cant be beat! The Rainbow is nice as well, on Perreault Lake, no access to Lac Seul but conected to several other lakes as well."
4098385,Steve Ediger,2015-08-03 11:09:00,97,"Don't book anything until you have visited Lac Seul Lodge. It is south of Ear Falls about 12 miles. Rod and Lorita have a great camp and it is close to the good fishing - Mckinzie Bay, Manitoba Point, etc. Steve"
4098473,Knoxabilly,2015-08-03 11:30:00,225,Evergreen- Pat and Moose will take care of you! Great cabins and amazing boats.

4099065,Mark R,2015-08-03 15:30:00,1538,I have been going to Evergreen for the last 20 years or so and have never been disappointed with the accommodations. They have nice large boats with 60hp Yamaha motors. I would recommend this camp to any one.
