I mean, I tore the transducer off the boat.......I was a LOT nervous showing up without some sort of protection. Gord will have to report on the beer cap tournament standings as he was the official coordinator of the first ever Canadian Beer Cap fishing extravanganza. I will say that ""fabulous"" prizes were given to the winners last week while we were in camp. Our cabin received a LaBatt's lure for the week.......it didn't go so well as some cabin members modified my original design ( I know it could have caught a trophy bottle bass without mods ). Hopefully ,there is another tournament taking place this week with the inventory of lures Gord has. PjShorthorn"
4103473,v-bay gord,2015-08-04 20:31:00,3168,"Two young anglers had the fortune to catch fish on the ""Bad #ss Lure"" that PJ created. One was a smaller walleye and the other a smaller pike. Glad to see the lures put to use........and yes, they were lavishly rewarded with VBL bling, I'm hoarding the remaining stock for a week when more young anglers are in camp. The interesting part of the lure that PJ creates with beer caps is the fact he must drink one beer for each lure created. Perhaps that is why he looks like the side profile of a grand piano when he walks down to the dock........"

I left out the ""Don't try this at home"" disclaimer re: dam jumping. I also left out several choice skunk encounters that you might be willing to try on your next sojern north. Bill"

4105657,Mike Kansas,2015-08-05 17:06:00,1463,Sounds like a great trip and it's good to see you reached out and tried to even the score with Gord after he tried to ruffle your feathers a bit. Mike Kansas

4102825,rnnonmt,2015-08-04 17:39:00,992,"Man oh Man Pat. That is some rather extraordinary adventures! Glad you had a great time and no one lost any teeth or appendages. I cant wait for the full report. Now I'm going to have to think again about your offer and idea of a second fishing trip on a house boat in the NE section of Lac Seul. Sounds like it will be filled with reckless abandon. Its looking even more appealing now. By the way, my bet was on the Labatts cap lure! Brian"

You pose a good question.....what should be in store for next year??? My favorite part of any trip is knowing that every one will be an adventure. I'm going to wait to see what next year's trip brings because I'm sure someone will top this year's hijinx . The thing that bothers me a little bit is that I may be the guy to be the top goof on the trip next year PjShorthorn"

4100025,pjshorthorn,2015-08-03 20:42:00,5654,"It took me awhile to wade through all of the insightful posts on Walleye Central since I left for my trip at V-Bay Lodge on 7/23. I was fully expecting some sort of post on this forum that would require myself to provide a corrective response upon my return.First off, I'm actually 6-6 1/2 "" (it sounds better when you round up a bit ) and a touch under 260 lbs ( or at least I was before the trip). Yes , I'm Samsquatch size and I run an older model Skeeter that has hardly any freeboard left when trolling with oars. Thanks for the tip Gord, I'll try those fishing kites you suggested to get us up on plane next time......there seemed to be some logic in that suggestion.......I'm not sure why yet, but I'm going with it for the time being.We had a "" fabulous"" trip at V-Bay Lodge with many new Canadian experiences that included jumping beaver dams in a boat ( yup...a new sport -- Uuummmhhh, Gord sorry about tearing off the transducer ), beer cap fishing lure tournament for all camp anglers ( debate is still out whether Labatt's Blue caps catch more vs Molson Canadian caps) , mud infested beaver dam jumping boats requiring power washing at the boat ramp in camp, chopping down trees to retreive lures from errant casts, deciding to remove old line from reels using the boat motor ( not advised), burning your partner's fishing line with an errant cigarette ash; creating a backlash on a baitcasting reel , so severe , that a group member is now immortalized as Big Bird; running over a person's marker buoy ( who was nice enough to say....fish here with us ) not once but multiple times; snagging a different person's marker buoy and moving it from 20 fow to 35 fow....Ooopps; not recognizing that the cap on the pee bucket was missing and which said pee ended up in their boat ....now requiring a full shampooing of the carpet.Through it all, we actually caught some quality fish.I do have to say that the fishing cleaning service at V-Bay Lodge is excellent. Although not a big deal, there were some eyebrows raised by many guests on the full biking attire worn by Gord when cleaning fish. I think many of us are still trying to figure out if the bike helmet with the spandex jersey and shorts offered some sort of protection when cleaning fish.If I could offer one suggestion Gord; if you have to wear the spandex bike shorts while cleaning fish.....tone it down a bit. There is no need to sport a Canadian Maple Leaf on each cheek. For cripes sakes, we knew we were in Canada when it took a Loonie to get in the coined operated bathroom in our cabin.PjShorthorn"
