4090818,bassnblast,2015-07-30 19:55:00,56,"Fished out of Ash Rapids Lodge on LOTW in June. Smallie fishing was excellent and the lodge is 5 minutes from Shoal Lake. The waterway between the main bodies of LOTW and Shoal is a great area -- highly recommend! Also had amazing smallmouth fishing at Hawk Lake Lodge, Crow Rock Lodge (LOTW), and on the north end of Rainy Lake at Camp Narrows. I think you would enjoy any of these lodges..."
4090882,ftfarms,2015-07-30 20:23:00,444,I will have to add another lake Cedar lake has been a awesome smallmouth lake for many years. I caught 38 smallmouth and over 100 walleyes one day (July 24th 2013) that whole week was awesome. We stay at cedar point resort when we fish cedar. Good luck. And god bless.
4113889,Bob_Loblaw,2015-08-09 12:33:00,109,Thanks for all the suggestions. I've got a good list started to research a bit more!
4077122,Bob_Loblaw,2015-07-26 11:03:00,109,Can anyone suggest best options for Ontario bass adventures - either drive or fly-in is fine.
4077154,Ogoki,2015-07-26 11:27:00,291,"Last September my canoe buddies and I fished Quetico . Don't know if you want to rough it that much or not. Absolutely AWESOME smallmouth fishing . Lots of 18 to 21 inch fish. Since you have to canoe in the fishing is catch and release except for the walleye we ate. Caught walleye, pike, lake trout and smallmouth. There is an outfitter on the east side of Quetico , who takes you and your camping gear in to the edge of the park by ATV . He has big aluminum canoes stashed there for your use. Trip cost is $500. I was told the park camping fee is covered in that too. We did not use him but spoke with a couple who came in , using that outfitter. We are going back again this September . Took us 2 1/2 days to get to that lake , but we fished our way in . Somebody looking for great fishing and don't mind camping its a pretty good deal."
4077634,ftfarms,2015-07-26 16:48:00,444,"Lake of the woods. You got large and small mouth bass. Last year the small mouth bass fishing was just stupid good. Haven't made it up yet this year. I will be be there in 13 days. We caught so may 16-20"" ers last year your forearms would be sore at the end of the day."
4078858,Thompmd,2015-07-27 07:44:00,320,"I am primarily a Smallmouth fisherman when we visit Canada but have only fished LOTW out of Nestor Falls/Sabaskong Bay. There is another lake very close called Kakagi(aka Crow Lake) that is very clear and very good smallmouth fishing. Another called South Narrows but the fishing hasn't been the best for us there. We always went in June and have been their on the 1st week sometimes and the 3rd week sometimes. I love the area on LOTW we stay at. We typically fish 4-5hrs in the mornings and 5/6hrs in the evenings and generally average 20-30 in the mornings and slightly more in the evenings. We have had a few days where we probably caught nearly 100 but those aren't the norm. Most average 12-15"" and always a few longer than that. Be wary of those telling you how many and how large theirs are.I have done a lot of research on different lakes but have never visited Shoal Lake, Rainy Lake. If I were to fly-in I would likely choose Kishkutena Lake. Feel free to PM or ask any questions you may have. Good Luck"
4081970,Stu,2015-07-28 07:31:00,472,"Some of my buddies go to Shoal Lake Lodge. If is just east of Kenora, near the Manitoba border. It is supposedly one of the best smallmouth and pike lakes on Ontario, but I have personally never fished there."
4082138,Obabikon,2015-07-28 08:12:00,2370,Kishkutena... pretty cool fly in. Give Shane at NW Flying in Nestor a call... or Tinkers has a cabin on the lake too.
4082162,SinOrSwim,2015-07-28 08:18:00,1528,Take a look at Hawk Lake Lodge. Great smallie fishing there
4082946,Guest,2015-07-28 11:38:00,0,Staunton Air north of Toronto flies in to some lakes that have largemouth and smallmouth fishing. I have fished with them a couple times and caught many nice fish.
4088322,Baseline,2015-07-30 05:20:00,3207,"If you want to rough it then the Quetico is the place to be for a bass adventure. Otherwise my recommendation is Vic and Dot's resort on Whitefish Bay LOW. Best largemouth fishing anywhere I've been. From there you can drive to Crow (5 miles) for smallmouth. Another bonus of Whitefish Bay and Crow is that over a week you will turn some big pike and maybe take on a musky. It a lot of fun trying to land on with that bass gear. The Resort is modern, well cared for and run by some great people."
4090010,Sean,2015-07-30 14:07:00,160,Lots of Smallmouth in Goshawk Lake North of Kenora. We stayed at Halley's camps Caribou Falls. I think Babe Winkleman may have done a few shows there.
