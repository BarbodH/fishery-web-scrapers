We went from July 30th to August 3rd leaving in the morning.It has been posted in the past but I want to re-affirm: this is a truly 1st class organisation starting with owner and ownser's family, pilots, camp keeper, boats,motors, camps etc... everything is top notch.We were right on the full moon, rain and a lot of wind; so all thoses conditions have made fishing a little tough. Next time I will ask Mr. Blanchard (the owner) to take care of those elements (lol)!Even with those reverse conditions we manage to catch our share of walleyes and one 27"".Definitely a trip to repeat."

4107721,Andre (wallyandre),2015-08-06 13:11:00,2274,Forgot to say that I travel from Mt-St-Michel to Parent a few times per season for over 30 years and I never seen the road in such a good condition!! It was like a carpet. For coming down it wasn't nice like that but very good.
4108105,fishron,2015-08-06 16:47:00,317,"Andre, I'm glad to hear you had a good trip to Hebert. The variances in the weather can make any trip more challenging, especially if it's your first trip in. Personally, I became aware of the trials of being in the front of the boat in rough weather for the first time. I usually drive but my partner had the tiller that day. We made a run back to the cabin in high seas and at 71, I wondered if I should be restricting myself to farm ponds. My dentist will be reseating my fillings on my next visit. I'm glad you found as I did the quality of the operation. Were you on the island or uplake? Hebert is a great lake as are many that are reported on this site. Hope you get back next year."

4108737,octanehi5,2015-08-07 03:43:00,1104,"Good to see you had a great trip, Weather has and always will be a factor on Hebert,Some of the best fishing is during the rough weather.So far everyone that I have talked to has had a good week this yr. with the exception of groups that went in early,late iceout and very cold weather The lake never warmed until the last week in June, and averaged 8 to 10 degrees below normal. 2016 is already booked"
