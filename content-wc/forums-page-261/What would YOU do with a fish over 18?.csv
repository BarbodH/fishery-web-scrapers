4105105,youngknight,2015-08-05 12:49:00,228,"I guess I eat too **** much...my son and I would eat 1.5 16-18 inch walleye each...lemon quarters, fried potatoes....a cold beer for me. Part of the experience of a fly in trip for us...Don't feel guilty about it at all. Well within the limit - completely ethical. Brought a few fish home in order to share a treat with my wife and daughter who did not come. Again, completely legal and I feel no guilt about whatsoever. Others at camp were going the last day or two to fill their quota on pike - all sizes that were legal, any perch they could catch. I scratched my head at that....just meat hunting, but again, entirely legal and well within their rights and tons of small pike so resource still healthy...so I didn't judge."
4105129,youngknight,2015-08-05 12:56:00,228,"As for the question posed by the OP...an interesting one at that...think I would fillet and eat if a mistake was indeed made...we had some walleye this year that were right at the 18 inch mark and had to measure a few times to see if just under or just over...some days there was hardly a fish obviously under to keep for a meal...so had to do some measurements...I could see with a live fish sometimes not wanting to lie still an error being made despite your best efforts.in terms of legality...darned if you do, darned if you don't. The Ontario Fish and Game Act makes it an offense to waste wild fish or game so if it is too big then you got a problem, if you throw a dead or almost dead fish back you are wasting wild meat and so you got a problem. (Waste includes wild meat that will be consumed by other wildlife even though we could argue philosophically about that....the Fish and Game Act makes it pretty clear)."

4105433,bigwalleye1,2015-08-05 15:11:00,2632,"Since I'm one of the ones that referenced a chewing, perhaps an explanation... I think a lot depends on whose boat the fish is in, On the experience in going or newbie status, whether we're in for shore lunch or at camp at the end of the day. Our short timer is 5 years in, all at the same boady of water. by now, everybody should know the rules. I want to hear the size before a fish goes in my deadwell. My boat potentially implicates me in a fine situation, so if the violation occurs with me, we've got a different problem that if it's in the other boat. Given the choice, I'd rather eat it now. 2nd choice is feed the gulls. Last choice is carry it around all day and chance a warden encounter on the water, on the road, or in the lodge."
4106625,MN_Moose,2015-08-06 06:58:00,964,"A lot of variables. Is the 18.1 fish still alive? Was it in an aerated live well? If so, I would release the fish. If the fish is already dead. Eat it. Life lesson. And from experience everyone needs to know the rules in metric. A c/o once scolded me for not knowing how close to the limit 18.1"" walleye is. 46 cm the parentheses are a reference."
4109737,Bakefish,2015-08-07 10:39:00,1077,"Number of centimeters x .3937, so a 46 cm fish is actually 18.11""."
4104057,vteye,2015-08-05 07:08:00,812,"We had 6 this year including 3 newbies. Rules were explained early and discussed multiple times on the 20 hour drive. Discussion started with beers in the boat and lake limit of 1 over and 1 under 18.1 with conservation license. Two guys decided they wanted a full license as a result. Another discussion was about 1 limit of fish per day including fish eaten at lunch time etc. We stressed importance of keeping the daily count accurate and also knowing how many filets where in the fridge and who takes responsibility. Glad we stressed and reviewed time an time again. We were checked last evening by fly in Ont wardens and accurately checked out. An illegal fish goes back in the water along with a chewing out. If I had any sense that it could repeat, the invite is gone for next trip. I am there to fish an not baby sit.."
4104121,SinOrSwim,2015-08-05 07:26:00,1528,"I'm sort of amazed at how many on here have mentioned chewing the others out. First, this was a hypothetical to ask what the better solution was. Keep or toss?? But, if I made a mistake and someone in my group ""chewed me out""???? lol That would NOT go over well."
4104337,ftfarms,2015-08-05 08:17:00,444,I'm with you sin. I wouldnt tolerate someone chewing me out for something I did that didn't hurt them any.
4104433,Hawkfan,2015-08-05 08:39:00,237,"Yeah I'm pretty sure I wouldn't need that invitation for the following year if I got scolded like a dog that just peed on your floor. It's always been pretty obvious to people that know me I'm a rule follower, but I also understand everyone makes mistakes. Look at some of your parents... Hey-ooohhhh."
4104457,SinOrSwim,2015-08-05 08:41:00,1528,"LOL well played. And, I know for a fact on a scale of 1 to 10 you are NOT even the funniest one in your group. 2nd or 3rd......maybe?"
4104601,Mark R,2015-08-05 09:53:00,1538,"Everyone in our group knows the rules so it is unlikely that this would happen. However, if it did I would suggest to the person that kept it to feed it to the next eagle he sees. ( we don't do shore lunch) I doubt there is very much that actually ""goes to waste"" when it comes to dead fish floating on the water. If the eagles don't get it the gulls will Evergreen Lodge sends out a ""slot box"" with each boat it has a measurement cut at 18 inches and is painted red to indicate the slot and the box is 27 inches long so you can see if the walleye or northern is in the slot or over. Very handy to measure the fish."
4104841,roscoe33,2015-08-05 11:12:00,653,"OK, I have not fished out of zone 6 for probably 40 years. Our lakes are ""1 over 18"" lakes, so the situation has less chance of happening for us. Our resort owner stresses non over 21"" please. I don't think we have every kept an eye over 20 in Canada, but a few 18-20, when everything we caught was over 18. Yet every year, we see groups bringing in a pile of fish, 22-27"". They whoop it up in the cleaning shack, high giving and clinking beer bottles. Then the resort owner walks in, and writes down their names. I'm not sure if he really doesn't let them come back, but they seem to get the message. As for the question at hand, it would be gull/eagle/northern food. Heck, I made the long ride back to the cabin last year, to get the license that my nephew (35) forgot to put in his wallet. Chewed him out good for wasting 2 hours of my time, and $45 worth of gas."
4104913,38bill,2015-08-05 11:37:00,331,I always make sure everybody in the group knows the rules. Especially if they are inexperienced.
4104969,strength22,2015-08-05 11:59:00,49,"I catch and release. if I want a walleye to eat I will keep ONE walleye and in the 14-16"" range. Throw the fish back. One walleye gives me two nice fish sandwiches or whatever. plenty for me or anybody else unless you eat too darn much."
4105089,Hawkfan,2015-08-05 12:45:00,237,Oh boy. Now we are judging how much people eat.
4102673,sept61,2015-08-04 16:58:00,91,"It should NEVER happen, know the rules before you hit the water to fish. No excuses!"

If we got pulled over I guess we would figure that out when the time came. No arguing, no fighting, and no lectures. Life is too short to lose friends over an 18.5"" walleye or 200 dollars.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
4102897,bigwillies,2015-08-04 17:46:00,515,"Was going to ask if they were slot size lakes ( lac seul, eagle) but big walleye one is right. Tell them the rules and demand they abide by them( What ever lake)If not, they r on their own."
4103665,Aspencreek,2015-08-04 22:22:00,2911,"Sin.....we have some pretty self righteous individuals on this thread. This did happen to me. I had my brother in law with me for his first trip to LS. It took him 2 days to finally catch one over 20"" (I know...how does that happen?? Answer: old junk fiberglass rods, until I made him use my stuff) He was so excited, but after trying to unhook it, insisting on doing it himself, dropping the poor thing, then posing for holy pictures I could not revive the fish. It was late afternoon, had a good hour + boat ride back to camp, and a strict camp rule on slot/overslot fish. The momma Eagle and her babies ate well that night. There was a lesson on how to unhook, hold, and release, taught and learned that very afternoon."
4103729,roscoe33,2015-08-05 01:31:00,653,"Pardon my ignorance, but what zones or lakes are you fishing that have this 18"" max size limit or slot?"
4103769,kzoofisher,2015-08-05 03:52:00,5144,"The lake I'm heading to in two weeks does, Windermere. I have one of those aluminum fish rulers and we always pinch the tails but we do 15 1/2"" - 17 1/2"" just in case. Not hard to get four in that range and it gives us some slop factor. I've got a measurenet too and nothing comes out of the net unless it is getting double checked for the livewell or is a picture fish. As for the hypothetical, it would go in the lake. Watching that fish become turtle food helps the lesson sink in. I've killed fish I couldn't keep and culled a 17"" for for a badly hooked smaller fish. It sucks sometimes. My son is in the boat though and teenagers can have a much broader view of ""situational ethics"" than old men, especially about things that their friends say are OK, so I think the rigidity of my stance is justified as an example. I'm at least partly responsible for everything that goes on in the boat, whether it's my boat or yours, and I'll speak pretty freely there especially if the deed isn't done yet. If the fish is discovered back at camp and the offender genuinely made a mistake and really feels bad about it I'm not going to be a jerk. I will hand him a drink and make sure he knows how to measure and what the rules are. If he's unrepentant we won't fish together again. I don't need the stress of wondering what that guy is doing and if I'll get dragged into something with the MNR because of it."
4103889,bigwalleye1,2015-08-05 06:02:00,2632,"Lac Seul has a release slot, 18.1 to 21.4 (or thereabouts). To me, anything over 17 3/4 goes back."
4103913,Aspencreek,2015-08-05 06:13:00,2911,"Correct...now the lesson is taught to newbies on the first fish, and nothing over 17"" make it to the cooler. If we are keeping fish for shore lunch or dinner we can fish all day for a couple between 16-17"". Try it, it's not as easy as you think!"
4103921,SinOrSwim,2015-08-05 06:19:00,1528,"We fish Lac Seul and it has a slot. Our camp I think also has a rule that nothing over 18 is kept regardless of the rules Also, for the 17 years prior to that we flew in. All the lakes we went to were conservation only lakes. We never took a single fish out of those lakes longer than 18"". And, I agree if you only take fish between 16 and 17 or 18, it is not that simple. We try but if it gets too tough we will take some smaller ones. Then we mock the people that kept them while we are cleaning them. lol Awwww, who caught this ""cute"" one??????"
4104017,fishron,2015-08-05 06:50:00,317,"The only Ontario lake I fish at present is in Zone 18. 15.7 to 19.7 are the keeper sizes so 18's are the preferred fish and if the run a bit larger that's okay. I always familiarize myself with the regulations and don't care to take the chance of breaking the regulation and getting fined. The province puts a lot of time in developing fisheries that are sustainable and as a guest its my job to obey the rules. If an under or over fish in the fishing group is discovered and it's dead, I would suggest to give it back to the environment immediately."
4102169,SinOrSwim,2015-08-04 14:11:00,1528,"The MNR ticket thread got me thinking. Say, you went to Canada with some guys who have very little experience fishing. You pull over for lunch and find they have fish that are over 18. Maybe 18.5 or even 19 inches? Would you dump that fish so you/they didn't get caught or risk it so it doesn't go to waste?"
4102201,JOE WALLEYE,2015-08-04 14:26:00,753,At that point I think the only ethical thing to do is teach them so they don't make the same mistake again. Filet the fish and eat it.
4102209,bigwalleye1,2015-08-04 14:27:00,2632,"Lots of looks and no bites so far. I'll try: If I'd have pointed out the rules beforehand, CHEW on somebody. If I had not, I wouldn't chew as hard. I would, though, point out they better fess up if MNR shows up, and I'd get cooking, but it better be only one fish. Otherwise, here guys, this is the shorelunch box. I'm not that hungry, and I'm going back out fishing, and you are on your own."
4102217,SinOrSwim,2015-08-04 14:28:00,1528,"I guess that is part of the question. Would you carry it around with you all afternoon? Say you found out at lunch when you stop for sandwiches? I can see both sides to be perfectly honest. I agree, ethically I wouldn't want it to go to waste, but I'm not sure I'd risk a $200 ticket for it either?"
4102225,wallydave,2015-08-04 14:29:00,2151,"You have to tell them the rules!! Before you hit the water, trying to explain the rules after they have caught, maybe the first big walleye will be pretty frustrating for all involved! Been there, done that! Its better to tell them ahead of time, than have a MNR guy seperate them from some money!"
4102233,MrSimon,2015-08-04 14:30:00,922,"I assume they are in a different boat ..... and in that case, I'd tell them the rules and let them make their own decision. If they were fishing in the same boat as me, that fish would never have been kept in the first place."
4102401,pjshorthorn,2015-08-04 15:36:00,5654,"Every year I research the regs and make sure I understand them regardless of the lake we are fishing. If I need confirmation of my understanding, I'll ask the outfitter. Did that this year. I make sure everyone in the group has a clear understandiing of the slot requirements and possesion requirements for each species. If I'm in the boat with a person, they continue to be educated as each fish is caught.....had to do it with my Dad this year as his short term memory isn't the best. I haven't ever been in a position to have to decide what to do with a slot fish or quantities of fish over the possession limit. I would like to think that it is because I try to pay attention to those details so no one is put in an awkward position if checked on the water or in camp. Some people I know would just say it is because I'm a terrible fisherman I guess if a person made a mistake, I would allow them to decide what they feel is the right thing to do . If their decision was really against the grain, I would step in and give them my opinion and have an open discussion. If things headed south during the discussion.....you are on your own including me providing full disclosure to a CO if they were to check the group. If I made the mistake myself or allowed a person fishing with me to keep a fish illegally, then I am fully accountable. That is just how I roll. I've had a few arguements with my Dad on this exact subject over the years when he has suggested keeping a questionable fish on the low end of the slot or one way over the slot that didn't make sense. The option given to him was throw it back or keep it and swim home with it on the stringer. So far he hasn't swum home yet. PjShorthorn"
4102417,SinOrSwim,2015-08-04 15:43:00,1528,"Okay, take out the ""this will never happen in my boat"". This is a hypothetical. What WOULD you do????? You HAVE a fish over 18 in your boat. What would you do? Keep it to clean later because you don't want to waste the fish knowing you might be pulled over and it is an almost $200 fine? Or, would you dump the fish and let the eagles have at it? Honestly, I'd dump it and let the eagles have it. It is already dead. Nothing I can do about that. But, I'm not risking a $200 fine to make sure I didn't waste one single fish. It's a lose lose situation."
4102545,rnnonmt,2015-08-04 16:21:00,992,Tough choice! If it were me I would feel disappointed in myself for allowing it to happen but I certainly wouldn't want the fine that goes along with it. Eagle food is my choice. Circle of life. Somehow I wouldn't feel as bad knowing it didn't go completely to waste.
4102665,jimirjr,2015-08-04 16:57:00,1149,"Big PROBLEM in Colorado this season... In MY lake.. (Chatfield Res.) ...
