4103961,JIGSTER,2015-08-05 06:36:00,30,"Just returned from Wabaskang on the 30th. I dont fish for trout but there was a group in camp that did. They caught several nice ones, they were fishing at Aerobus Bay up in the northwest corner. They would boat around and mark trout suspened in deep water then troll. They used big rods with what looked like 2oz.-3oz. bottom bouncers with a long leader with some shiney spoons. Hope that helps a little, good luck!"
4104481,Stu,2015-08-05 08:54:00,472,"I have fished for lakers in Aerobus Bay too. He fish with ciscoes on the bottom. Run your line through their vent and pass it through the mouth with a treble hook attached to the front. It's impossible to anchor in deep water, so we free-spool our reels and motor to the island in the middle of the bay. Then it's just a waiting game (Kinda like catfishing)."

4105369,SinOrSwim,2015-08-05 14:44:00,1528,We were up in late June/early July. There was a guy in camp who fished for nothing but Lakers. These big dipsy divers and all this bling. It was pretty neat. Looked sort of complicated and expensive. LOL
