4101377,ftfarms,2015-08-04 10:16:00,444,I heard there spots on 621 to morson that is rock and some windshields are getting cracked. Is this still a problem should we still go 600 up to 621??? Heading up Friday. Thanks

A lot more gravel on HWY 600 than first reported the previous weekend. Be careful. SLOW DOWN. I'd avoid 600 as there's less traffic and probably not packed down. I'm heading up Friday, too. It was pretty much a gravel road a couple weeks ago."
