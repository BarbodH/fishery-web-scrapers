4094585,jab,2015-08-01 15:54:00,12,"We have been going to a camp in the Ignace area that is part of the English River system. The walleye fishing has been good at times, but not huge numbers of fish by any means and really no big fish (over 25""). Would like any input or suggestions of lakes/camps in Ontario for a fall trip with the opportunity for good numbers of walleyes along with the chance for really good size. At this point , we would take large walleye over numbers of fish. Any suggestions are appreciated. Thanks!"

4094705,jab,2015-08-01 16:59:00,12,We are really open to anywhere in Ontario. We are looking for a drive-in camp where we can bring our own boat. Typically have our own cabin. A boat in camp is also ok. Thanks!

4097745,strength22,2015-08-03 07:53:00,49,Been fishing Ontario for 35+ years and been all over Ontario. Other than doing a private fly in the best walleye fishing I have found is in the Gullrock/Red lake area. Gullrock in the fall is darn good. Wrights camp is a great place to stay. Closer to the fishing than the other camps on the lake. Not much pressure in the fall. Just my opinion.
