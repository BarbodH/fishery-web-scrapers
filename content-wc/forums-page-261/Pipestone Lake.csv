It will be our first time to this lake. It's been difficult to find much info online as there are very few reports and minimal lake maps. We have some info from the lodge of course, but I just want to cover all my bases. Any recent reports that anyone knows of? Any special tactics I should prepare for on this lake? Any general info you feel to share? You can PM me or post here. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance, KC"

When the lake is ""on"" its great fishing. We fished mostly walleye. Very deep lake in places. Very clear water. Nice lake. Good Luck."

4093337,KC Walleye,2015-07-31 22:58:00,274,Cool. Thank you. That's about my luck with info on this lake. Lol. Thanks again guys. Will post report in a week or so.
4113002,KC Walleye,2015-08-08 20:55:00,274,"Recent trip was a bust.....very tough walleye fishing to say the least. 5 very experienced walleye fishermen caught 30 or so walleyes in a week and none over 25"". Not complaining I guess as it beats working, but still frustrating with all the effort that was put in. Other people in camp caught basically 0 walleyes each day so I guess we did better than most. I won't post much more as I don't want to dissuade anyone from trying this lake. But be forewarned, fishing for walleyes on Pipestone is very tough.....VERY! Haha. Happy Fishing y'all, KC"
