Coming from Thunder Bay there appears to be two routes. 1. 17 west to 72, then 72 right into Sioux Lookout2. 17 west to hwy 599 then hwy 642 into Sioux Lookout Which way should I go? Option two appears slightly shorter but is it slower going? Thanks guys!"
4102865,redryder,2015-08-04 17:42:00,33,17 west to 72 and half an hour later you are in Sioux. Don't do the other route. 642 is narrow and twisty and i think maybe some reconstruction happening. Good luck.It's 1.5 hrs from Ignace to Sioux and no gas stations between for your info.

4104153,anglerjake,2015-08-05 07:39:00,57,"Red is right. We stayed at a little lake on 642 just east of Sioux Lookout first part of July. Took 642, 599, 17. It was pretty, but slow, and there was quite a bit of road construction. Gravel truck threw a rock and chipped the rental car windshield. Had good fishing thoughJake"
