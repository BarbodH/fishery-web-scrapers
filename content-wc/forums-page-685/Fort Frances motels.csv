559405,Guest,2006-07-14 20:39:00,0,My wife and I are going to be in Fort Frances on July 21st and I was hoping someone could recomend a motel in or near town. Everything in International Falls is booked for that night. Any help would be appreciated.
559411,Guest,2006-07-15 09:33:00,0,I have stayed at both the Adventure Inn and the Super 8 (which has a pool but no bar or restaurant) either one is about $85 per night US) Both are adequate...Super 8 is a little newer. Have a good time!!
559412,Guest,2006-07-15 10:45:00,0,We stayed here one night: Reasonably priced and they have a restaurant and bar over looking Rainy.http://www.rendezvoushotel.com/

We got our licenses that evening at the sport shop several blocks away, and were on our way East on 11 bright and early the next morning. Already booked there for next July. Dave"
