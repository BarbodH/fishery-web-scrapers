560061,Guest,2006-08-07 11:22:00,0,Frank Studley...Cass Lake Minnesota. Frank Guided on Cass for years. He left us for the Big Lake in the sky back in the 80's but the man could catch Walleye. He fished by watching markers on shore and memory. He could keep you on a ledge just because he knew it was there. In about 1966 I bought him a depth finder and than he nreally became good. His kind set the mark for others and the path for fisherman to follow. May he ge Guiding the Lord today...if he is they are catching fish.

559898,Guest,2006-08-01 13:06:00,0,"When they're jumping in the boat just about anyone can guide but when the fishing is tuff, that's a guide who can make a difference. That man for me is Dean Tate, Denare Beach, Sasketchewan. I had a trip normally scheduled for the last week of August get delayed until the last week of September & first 3 days of October due to a wedding. It was snowing the day we pulled into camp. We had no trouble filling our limits of walleye at the river but catching pike was different story. After three days of no fish we called Dean Tate. Dean told us that the shallow weed beds that produce pike in August where pretty sparce in October. Dean took us to rocky points off of deep water and had us fish with large jigs and deep crank baits. He told us to fish slow like we're fishing for walleyes. We all went home with limits of pike. Would of been a pretty sorry trip otherwise."
