560082,1shooter,2006-08-07 20:59:00,1493,I bought the large ones. As far as keeping them cold they came packaged in a cooler. I bought the small packages which were $.85 each. About 12-18 large shiners in a package. I believe I bought around 30 packs. I then froze them and transported them in a cooler.

559708,cincymike,2006-07-24 14:11:00,8,looking for experience/opinions on using salted minnows vs night crawlers and live minnows. going into the sioux lookout area in a week i heard several people speak very highly about the frozen salted minnows.
559711,mwal,2006-07-24 15:32:00,151,I used to always salt/borax my own minnows. However this year we had graduations and weddings so no time to properly prepare minnows. We tried the Cabela's preserved emerald shiners in bulk. We will be using them next year as well. The worked very well for us. They held up on bottom bouncer rigs and jigs and are not messy. Otherwise salted boraxed minnows work well. I take a 50 50 mix of salt and borax put a inch or so into a pail put a layer of minnows making sure they are not touching each other and are reasonably dry then cover them with a inch or 2 of the salt/borax mixture. I let them sit for a day or two then remove them from mixture they should be shriveled up and starting to dry out. I put them into zip lock bags usally 2 dozen to a bag and freeze them. That way I only thaw what I need for the day. The can get mesy in your boat but work well. Mwal
559713,Jimmy Jig,2006-07-24 16:01:00,1905,"I do about like mwal does. This year I cut the borax down to about 30% of the mix. Use canning salt. I use an ice cream pail cover the minnows, I don't really care if they touch, but spread them out good. I leave them in frig 24 hrs. and then I do it over for another 24 hrs. Then I put them in a snack bag with a little salt. I do not freeze them, only put in frig. I use about 2 dozen in each bag. I keep them in a cooler in the boat and there is no mess except the salt. They worked on L.S. in June and July. Used with jigs only. They beat $4.00 a dozen live ones. Good Fishing! 5"
559717,MoWalleyeguy,2006-07-24 16:50:00,409,Just thought I would chime in... this year they asked when we crossed the border if we had any bait including Salted Minnows or Salted baits... we said no. Are they not allowing them now?
559736,mwal,2006-07-25 08:14:00,151,Thats one of their standard questions. If you say yes sometimes they will ask if they are smelt which are not legal dead or alive. This year they asked me that I said no. Then they asked do you have any bait I said preserved minnows from Cabelas. They had me pull over open boat cover I got the bag half way out of the cooler and they said thanks you may leave. They didn't even see the whole bag or get close enough to read it. Oh well. Mwal
559739,1shooter,2006-07-25 09:21:00,1493,I was prepared to salt my own this year then I found this website.http://www.bestbait.com/ I bought the large ones for $.85 a pack. Couldn't justify doing them myself for that price. The shiners I received were of nice size and worked great. I bought the smaller packs for ease of use.
559765,Guest,2006-07-26 21:19:00,0,I called Best Bait to inquire about taking natural vs. salted minnows to Canada. The person I spoke with said you cannot take salted minnows into Canada but the naturally preserved ones are OK. I did not debate this with her.
559769,1shooter,2006-07-27 07:21:00,1493,They told me that too. They sold me what they called the Canadian pack. They worked great. Would like to hear the officail word on if you can bring salted or not.
559770,Guest,2006-07-27 07:48:00,0,"1Shooter, What size did you use and do you need to keep them refrigerated? What is in a ""Canadian pack"" and how much was it? I appreciate the help."
560076,Guest,2006-08-07 19:14:00,0,According to the border crossing general information provided by the Fort Frances Chamber of Commerce. Frozen or Salted Minnows are allowed. Information can be found @ WWW.canadianbass.com Does live bait out perform salted preserved? Any info would greatly be appreciated.
