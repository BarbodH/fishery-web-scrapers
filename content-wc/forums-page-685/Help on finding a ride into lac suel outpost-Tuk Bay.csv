I need to find someone who would be able to transport 2 possibly 3 non-flying fishermen(father and father inlaw)into outpost cabin in Tuk Bay june 29 2007, and out on July 3 2007.The camp we are renting cabin from fly's its guests in.I have stayed at the main camp on minnitaki over the last 25 years.They run a great camp and have many outposts, so last year my wife and I tryed their outpost at Tuk Bay.It was incredible!!.Now we are in the first stage of planning a trip of a liftime for both of our fathers.They do not fly.Talked to Lee at camp he suggested calling Lac seul outposts.I just got of the phone with a female who answered.I can tell you that they must not run their business to make a profit!!I explained my situation and then she asked why I was calling her and not the camp the outpost belongs to.I then explained to her that they were not able to boat in guests and I was just inquiring about the possiblity since there camp is close to Tuk Bay if, for a fee they would drop off and pick-up our non-flying party members.She then got a attitude and said ""were not a bus service"".WoW!!!, Considering I was going to pay $$$ for a service that I truly believe would not be that far from there normal run to their camp I was shocked.I have over the years bought items in their gift/tackel shop but never again.Sorry about the rant but thought they might like some easy money.So I am still looking for someone(outfitter or guide)or fellow fisherman who might be able to help.My party could meet boat at hudson landing or deception landing.If anybody has ideas please let me know. Thanks !! :bowdown:"
