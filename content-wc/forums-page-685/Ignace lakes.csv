559631,Guest,2006-07-22 07:42:00,0,We used to stay at Flayers for the past 35 years. however I haven't been at camp since 2000. I now stay at Russells place. We will be going next week so I'll let you know how we did.
560030,Guest,2006-08-06 09:47:00,0,"Just got back yesterday and did we have a good time. Fished Elephant (kukukus) did very well and had a fish fry on fishermans island. We also fished Smirch, Paddy, English River and Wintering. I caught alot of big walleyes on Wintering. My biggest was a 23"" walleye and a 32"" Northern and my husband caught a 8lb. trout on Paddy. Lots of fun!"
560039,Guest,2006-08-06 16:11:00,0,How did Russell get the boats to Kukukus? Did he use the north landind?Where is his camp located?Does he have a web site?Thanks for all your help!!! Terry
560043,Guest,2006-08-06 19:13:00,0,"Russell is now ""Born to Fish"" and is right on hwy 17 across from Agimac Lake. He doesn't have a website but I can give you his phone number if you want it and I also have his business card. I have known Russell since we were 5 years old. He is so good to us but we are like family. When we fished the Elephant we rented boats from Brent at Flayers. I told him that I had replyed to someone asking about the lakes around Ignace and he thought that was pretty cool. Where are you from? If you were at Flayers befor 2000 maybe I have seen you there? Kim"
560065,Guest,2006-08-07 13:00:00,0,"We are from Chicago. Some of the guys have been going to Flayers for 25 years.We took a couple of years off.Went to Erie(never again)and this year we went to seine river(could'nt get used to anchoring and jigging)so we are going back to Flayers,we almost always limit out by lunch time on Kukukus, the only bad thing about it is that ride and hump down to the lake, I'm the youngest at 40 and it gets rougher on the old bones every year but the fishing is worth it!!!

560088,Guest,2006-08-08 06:01:00,0,"I remember a group of guys from chicago and one of them was a police officer is that your group? We are from Appleton Wisconsin and have been going for a long time, (we usually went last week of July or first week in Aug.). I stoped going when Marion kicked Judy and Russell out. It was just too hard to be in the middle of that mess. We are like family to them all and thought is best to stay away for a while. Things are getting better but whith Brent owning the camp now and we can only hope soon that Russell and his Mother will be back. When we went to kukukus the walk down was still a bit rough and your right the older we get the worse it is. We went right to the north end and fished the weed bed and the point to the south of the weed bed and did great had enough for a shore lunch in a couple of hours. Russell sure nows how to do it up! Did you ever fish Wintering? We always do very good there and it is much easier to get to. We go right to the big island and usually fish there all day for walleyes and northerns. Kim"
560106,Guest,2006-08-08 14:06:00,0,"Thats us!I have not fished Wintering yet.The other guys have fished many other lakes. I don't know how they remember what lakes they fished,who they fished with and what fish they caught ten years ago but the stories end up with something funny happening to someone. I have fish Kukukus, Cecil(SP)Arathusa and Paguchi.We wanted to go to other lakes but the roads were washed out or we ran out of time.We tried other places but are more comfortable at Flayers."
560117,Guest,2006-08-08 20:08:00,0,"I knew it was you guys. I remember the officer the most, he showed us his stringer with some big fish one day on kukukus and told us where he caught them from and we went to the spot but I cant remember if we caught anything or not...it had to be 10 years ago. My husband and I would always bring my Mom with us. I think if we saw each other we would know who we are. I just got done talking to Russell on the phone and I told him about the conversation we are having here. He thinks its pretty cool and says he knows the Chicago bunch of guys. Anyhow... what week do you have at Flayers next year? Kim"
560129,Guest,2006-08-09 04:54:00,0,"I think it is the 3rd or 4th week of June.It will be good to be on the old lakes again,but first we have look forward to another cold, snowy winter,WOW I just got so depressed--- I have to go and reorginize my tackle box for next year,Bass Pro Shops here I come.lol"
