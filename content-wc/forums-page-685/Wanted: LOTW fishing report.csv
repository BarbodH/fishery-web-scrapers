560009,woogie,2006-08-04 18:21:00,63,We are staying at Crawfords in Sioux Narrows. I am bringing my own boat so we can travel almost anywhere. I also want to know if it is worth to bring your own crawlers?
560013,Guest,2006-08-05 07:32:00,0,I fished Long Bay and never made it W of Whitefish Narrows. Normally we run out to Deadbroke. I'm sure all the areas out there are good esp. the reefs!! Crawlers were probably better than leeches. DL
560015,downriverbob,2006-08-05 09:32:00,880,"Here is the website for the place you are staying:http://www.crawfordscamp.com/, they have some articles about lures and areas to fish and also a forum. You probably can get good information from there. I don't live bait fish when we are up there, mainly am fishing for musky, pike, bass, and trout. You will want to buy a map for the area when you get there. I use a map in conjunction with a map chip I have for my GPS. People get lost up there every year because they get out away from the area that they usually fish. Good luck ! BOB"
560017,Flip Silverlake,2006-08-05 10:32:00,645,Ok thanks. I've heard that the fishing has been good from where you were at and further north.

559970,woogie,2006-08-03 06:05:00,63,Anyone have any fishing info for the Sioux Narrows area. This is the first trip to Canada for my family and it would be nice to get into some fish and be able to bring the right gear.
559973,downriverbob,2006-08-03 08:24:00,880,"What type of fish and or fishing are you going to do, or want to do? I have been going to the area for about 8 years. BOB"

559995,Guest,2006-08-03 21:15:00,0,"Just got back from S.Narrows. Fishing was great and able to find eyes in 12-25'. Also got some nice smallies in same areas on reefs. Water came up 5"" w/ a downpour all night on Sunday. Need couple more of them! Water temps were approx. 77 but dropped to approx. 75 w/ rain but fishing stayed good. Good luck-DL"
559997,Flip Silverlake,2006-08-03 22:54:00,645,"Where were you fishing and what bait did you use. Heading up to Kenora for 2 weeks on the 11th. We were up in June and did really well. Heard that 18 to 25 feet seemed to be a good depth. I use mainly leaches but have had trouble finding them in late July. Were you fishing close to Sioux Narrows, or did you head up to Yellow Girl Bay and further north.???"
559998,woogie,2006-08-04 06:14:00,63,"We will fish primarily for Walleye but would like to try Perch and Crappie as well. I am bringing my wife and 3 daughters 14, 12, and 11. It's rough to keep them entertained in the boat. If I can't find fish I may be forced into water sports or worse yet...sunbathing and if it gets really bad I may have to go shopping. I would like to be prepared with the right gear and bait. Any intel would be greatly appreciated."
560000,Whitewater,2006-08-04 08:44:00,6,"Woogie, cherish every second you can spend with your daughters. Remember what's really important in life."
560002,downriverbob,2006-08-04 09:03:00,880,"Where are you staying ? The perch and crappie fishing isn't too good in Sioux Narrows area in the summer, you can try in Snake Bay but with the warmer weather and amount of boat traffic in the bay it can be tough. Outside of Snake Bay you are in Whitefish Bay, this is very clear trout type waters, you can catch bass both smallmouth/largemouth, northern pike, musky, in the shallow areas and lake trout in deeper waters. If you let me know where you are staying I will try to help you out. BOB"
