560052,thunderatwork,2006-08-07 07:16:00,79,"varies by time of day as well as day of week. when we went thru going up on the 31st no wait both ways. when we came back on the 5th (afternoon) it was right at a hour wait to come south thru fort frances, but still no wait going into canada."

We came back to the US on Saturday, July 22 at about 10:30 am and the line going north was unbelievably long. I don't know how long folks had to wait, but my guess is that it was at least an hour. I think the earlier you can get there, the better. Good luck! Dave"
