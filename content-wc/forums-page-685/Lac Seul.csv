560074,Guest,2006-08-07 18:08:00,0,Kind of a general question but i'm heading to Lac Seul this coming weekend for the first time. Any tips - hot spots - bait used - depth - troll - drift - jig or any general information for someone who hasn't fished here before? From my understanding we are staying on the south end near Hudson. Any info would be appreciated.
