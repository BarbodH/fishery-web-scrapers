559978,Guest,2006-08-03 09:39:00,0,27 hours til we leave for gullrock!!! anyone have any recent reports?
560023,Guest,2006-08-05 16:18:00,0,"Fished Gullrock July 22nd through July 29th. Stayed at Wrights Wilderness Camp. Nice camp, clean and very comfortable. Lee and Stephanie are Red Lake locals and are very knowledgable of the area and are very hospitable. I have fished this lake at least fifteen times and the fishing was as consistent this time as I have ever seen it. A lot of fish under the 18"" slot this year, but we caught a fair number over 18"" also. Had a great time fishing, and had beautiful weather. We booked the same week and same cabin for next year. Can hardly wait to go back. Good luck to everyone going up in August."
560045,Guest,2006-08-06 19:23:00,0,"Just got home last night. Had what I would consider pretty good fishing. Lots of fish! Doubles were very common. A lot of small fish though, but this is what I expect during the summer months. Biggest was just under 27"", then we had a couple 25's and numerous in the 20"" - 24"" range. We are not counters, but I would guess that out of our 8 guys, we would catch an average of 12 - 15 over 20"" each day. We fish with slip sinkers and use either plain snells or spinner rigs. Crawlers were our best bait, but we did have good success with minnows and leeches occasionally. Especially if the leeches were good size. We even experienced with Gulp. I can't confirm the saying that ""Gulp out fishes live bait"", but I can confirm that it works. I would guess Gulp might perform better for jig fishermen. Our best spot easily was the Rock. Usually in calm waters, which is contrary to how we catch them in the fall. We just fished the edges of the drop offs. The heel of the boot was our second best spot. Also had some luck at Henry Island and on the last morning, we did well at the small island SE of Burnt (the island with the red bouy). Went up into Keg one afternoon and caught only one fish over 15"". All in all, very satisfied with the trip. Now I have to wait another 6 weeks before I get to go back. Gas prices were a killer ($3.199 in the Falls, $1.199/ltr at Vermillion Bay and $5.00/Imperial gallon at our camp), but we talked ourselves into thinking it's a vacation and it only actually amounts to about $30 - $50 per person more than last year's trip.

560047,18Fisher,2006-08-06 19:34:00,59,where did u stay at?
560062,Guest,2006-08-07 11:31:00,0,"We stayed at Poplar Point. In the fall we stay at Wright's. Both are very good hosts. Our fall group has stayed at Wright's/Weaver's for over 20 years now. I have heard nice things about your hosts as well. Interesting to see your depths were 25' - 28' range. I wish I could get into jig fishing, but you know how fishermen are, they get stuck with a certain presentation that works for them and as a group, we have always used a slip sinker method. We caught most of our fish anywhere from 10' to 25'. Pat T"
559737,GullrockMan,2006-07-25 08:16:00,2,Anybody been to Gullrock recently? How is the walleye bite? I will be up there next week and am wondering if the bite is getting better yet.
559742,Renn,2006-07-25 10:44:00,87,"We leave August 4, but I had a good friend who was there last week, July 15 - 22. He didn't do real well. Most fish were in the 15-17 inch slot. They brought home thier limit and they ate all the fish they wanted. But he also mentioned they didn't have ideal ""walleye"" conditions. Sunny, flat water, with some thunder through the nights. He also mentioned there were still some mayflies around. Most of the fish he cleaned had mayflies in thier stomachs. Hopefully, things will start to pick up for you. Have fun. 9 days and counting! Renn"
559761,GullrockMan,2006-07-26 12:59:00,2,We will be coming back about the time you are heading up there. I will let you know how we did. Thanks for the info!!
559763,Guest,2006-07-26 16:41:00,0,As mentioned in a previous forum.....a buddy and I did well on Gullrock this past weekend. We were successful with jigs/minnows....changing colors until one worked. Caught several over 20 inches with the biggest being 26 1/2 inches. We worked Henry Island and the boot. Good Luck
559767,Guest,2006-07-26 23:30:00,0,Why do I not know where Henry Island is???
559771,Pat T,2006-07-27 08:33:00,221,I'd have to say that I don't think I have ever heard of Henry Island either unless it is the small island that has one or two bouys on it approx. South of the toe of the boot? We are leaving tomorrow afternoon and I know fishing has been sporatic this summer. Glad to hear a good fishing report for a change. I knew this great fishery would kick in sooner or later. Pat T
559773,Guest,2006-07-27 09:41:00,0,"What we consider Henry Island.....is an island located near one of the beaches. It's an island that an older gentleman fished for some 30 years....apparently he passed away and his children/grandchildren named the island after him. Let me think......second most northernly beach (eastern shore). Some folks identify the islands by number....but this one all I know it as is ""Henry Island"". We attempted fishing the entire boot but had most of our success near the heal. Any idea how fishing is on Two Island Lake!?!"
559791,grt1,2006-07-27 18:12:00,259,"as far as i'm concerned Henry Island is the island across from the clay banks, just north of Stevensons'point. a little island that is just off the sunken island."
559810,Guest,2006-07-28 14:54:00,0,Could there be two Henry Islands!?! Regardles.....the area your referring to is an area I have yet to fish. Maybe this weekend perhaps.....
559831,Guest,2006-07-29 10:31:00,0,"just got back from gullrock. This is no lie, my arms are tired from setting the hook on so many fish last week that i need the weekend to rest. Between 3 guys we went through 33 dozen minnows. Sometimes you would catch 3 or 4 fish on one minnow! The walleyes seemed to be in the 25'-28' range right on the bottom and i mean bottom! The proven method was a gold 3/8 oz. jig that you hit bottom with and slowly lifted up your rod to take tension out of the line and then BAM! fish on! anchoring was the waqy to stay on top of them and nobody else on the lake seemed like they caught on as we were the only one's doing it. sunken island and burnt island were the hoot spots for us but marker island produced some fish but not as consistant. good luck and grab a handful of gold jigs!"
