514304,Guest,2001-08-06 21:17:00,0,"Take a look at Rainbow Point Lodge, I've fished there 6 times so far and have no complaints, good fishing, nice cabins, great people, took my family there when my little guy was 3 months old. They have wallies, northerns, muskie, small mouth, perch, whitefish. Planning on another trip there next year. Prices are about 300-350 per person, includes cabin, boat, motor, gas, bait, conservation lic. If you have any questions e-mail me and check out there web site."
514305,Skyraptor,2001-08-09 16:12:00,291,You might also want to check out Kingfisher Lodge located on Wabaskang Lake which is at the town of Perrault Falls. I have been with this owner when he ran Keystone Lodge on Cedar lake for years and have had great results. I am thinking of going there next year with my son. Check out his website at: http://www.kingfisherlodge.com/

I've always caught fish on Perrault and had a great time. It's definately not the dead sea. It's just that fact that if you can't catch fish here, you just can't catch fish worth a ##### anyhow."
514308,Guest,2001-08-13 08:10:00,0,The best place to take your family in the Perrault Falls area is Rocky Shore Lodge. It has by far the best accomodations I have ever been to. There is plenty of fun available for you and your family. www.rockyshorelodge.com
