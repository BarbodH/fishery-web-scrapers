Friends got stuck in there for some time one evening, due to the water rushing back in after the wind drew it out during the day. The low water and swift current created a mess getting out - they used big motor as much as they could, also electric, paddles, ropes, etc. I didn't want to spend the night in there, although I have spent many nights there, except in a tent, much more comfortable than spending the night in the boat. I figured there would be a potential for that situation, and stayed away that year. Sure would like to get there this year, though. Last year was a snap. The good thing, maybe, is that in ""03 the crappies bit like crazy in Stevens Bay, where we will be staying at Young's. Are you going to be up there?"
559629,Guest,2006-07-21 21:12:00,0,"Hey Bill, We're heading up next Friday (28th) for nine days and back in mid-Oct. for nine more days. I remember '03 well and I know exactly what you mean about the water flowing into Obabikon with a strong south wind. That year I had a camp boat and one time I had to turn it around and back out with the main motor. Worked great but you can't do that with a big boat with console steering. Now I'm running a Crestliner 192 have 76 lb. thrust on the bow trolling motor. I'm pretty sure that will pull me thru even in strong current. If not, I'll let you know what it's like spending a night in Obabikon in a boat. Have a great trip in Sept. and post a report."

559648,Guest,2006-07-22 18:07:00,0,"It's 1058.4 now and at this time in 2003 it was about 1057.9. Also, the long term forecast is for continued dry weather, so by the time Oct. gets here it could be quite a bit lower. In Oct. of 2003 it was still about 1057.9, same level as it was in July, because there was some rain in August and Sept."
559649,Bill Krejca,2006-07-22 18:37:00,6107,"I forgot to mention that my friend ruined his electric getting out of there. He ended up buying a new one, hit too many rocks fighting the current getting out. It was not one of his most favorite excapades."
559743,bronzeback77,2006-07-25 14:36:00,97,I spoke to friend who owns a lodge on Snake Bay near Sioux Narrows. She said the water is a low as she has seen it in 20 years and the long range weather forecast is for more dry days ahead. Watch out for those rocks!!!
559753,GatorGuy,2006-07-25 21:41:00,15,Yep. That's what I said. Trust me.....I live here. LOL
559806,voyaguer,2006-07-28 11:22:00,54,"Can be a bit convoluted to get thru, but the Lake of the Woods Control Board (LWCB) has pretty good factual information on water levels including the connected river systems. go to : www.lwcb.ca what they don't have directly, but you can derive by inference in some cases, is water quality."
560004,bronzeback77,2006-08-04 10:08:00,97,Any changes? I hear that LOTWs may have gotten a lot of rain in the last week.

559544,Guest,2006-07-20 08:34:00,0,IS it true that the Lake of the woods is three foot to four foot low. IF so better make sure boat ins. is paid.

559608,Guest,2006-07-21 11:00:00,0,"Hey Bill, It's about the same or a little bit higher now compared to the summer of 2003. It's going to be fun getting into Obabikon, eh? You going up in Oct.?"
