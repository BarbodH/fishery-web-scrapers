559886,Rich B,2006-07-31 20:59:00,1081,"Have a extra week of vacation yet to use this year, and am looking at booking a week in early to mid October up North at a camp/lodge (probably Ontario). Am located in East Central Ohio, and have fished up north up thru mid Sept in the past, and have heard many camps close early to mid October most years due to the weather. I have fished LBDN over Thanksgiving a few years (some trips were better than others - ha); and am considering a mid October trip back to LBDN if I don't find a Canadian camp. If anyone has a camp they fish in central Ontario (up thru the Soo) into October, would you post their website/info ? OR if you have a suggestion for another location, that would be appreciated as well. Thanks, Rich B"

Does anyone know any camps where you can dock boats on the eastern or east/southern side(s) of Lake St Clair, other than the Basshaven camp ?(the Basshaven area is too shallow) Am checking out the Bay of Quint suggestions though still open to any other ideas/locations ? Thanks, Rich"

About 90 minutes north and east of Winnipeg, stay at a motel, and fish out of your own boat, with up to 400 other boats. Search for Greenbacks migrating to the mouth and into the river channel. Many of us go every year. My only over 30""'ers come from Pine Falls. Bring the warm clothes, just in case..."
560081,Rich B,2006-08-07 20:11:00,1081,"Burr, I would love to be fishing up there this fall, though from eastern Ohio it's too long a haul for a long weekend or even a week (ha !). Am looking for somewhere in mid-Ontario or the mid-west. Have heard about the great fishing up at Pine Falls, Mb; and appreciate your suggestion. Rich B"
560086,Mike Kansas,2006-08-07 22:18:00,1463,"Rich, Take a look at Little Canada Camp at Ear Falls. There is a Dam on the English river at Ear Falls. This is the Dam that holds Lac Seul Lake. We have been fishing there the last two years in the fall and have done very well. The camp is only 5 minutes from the dam and there is good fishing down river also. Check it out and let me know if I can answer any other questions or help you in any manner. Be happy to send you a map of the area. I just fish for fun and dont own any Resorts.www.littlecanadacamp.com Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
