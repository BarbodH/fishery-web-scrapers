I got a map of the area and plan on fishing Sabaskong and trailering to the lower part of Whitefish. I was wondering if anyone would help give me a jump start on good areas to start with, or give me a fishing report of how fishing has been in the area and what they are bitting on. Thanks in advance!!"
509776,Guest,2000-09-13 19:58:00,0,you should hit the crappie fishing just right. weve fished the area for years that week but cant make it this year.normally the crappies are hot right near the falls in the deeper water.Be sure to look for them on your electronics you will be able to see them on or near the bottom . As for the walleyes i always do real well then on nightcrawlers with a spinner /bouncer or plain snell.fish the deeper rock to mud transition 25- 30 ft for better fish. the smaller ones should be shallower.good luck. email me for more details if you like
