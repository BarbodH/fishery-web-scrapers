509615,TM,2000-08-23 10:28:00,76,Planning a long weekend (9/8/00 through 9/12/00) in Canada. Would Last Mountain or Rafferty be the best place?? Are there other lakes in that area that would be hot?? Any help would be appreciated.
509616,Pikeman,2000-08-23 17:31:00,93,"It depends what you want to catch...if you want to catch 100 fish in a day, go to Rafferty, the thing is, all the fish you catch will be 10-15 inches with maybe a 20 incher mixed in.If you want to catch maybe 30 fish in a day, plus a great shot at a 10#, go to Last Mountain. There are lots of big ones in the mountain, and the average fish size is better.Pikeman"
509617,Russ,2000-08-23 20:03:00,17,There is going to be a tournament out of Rowan's ravine on Last Mountain that weekend. But if you want big fish it would be the place to go. I do not know a lot about Rafferty other than it was a recently stocked reservoir with lots of fish. The only down side to Rafferty is that with the fishing pressure over the past few years fishing has gone a bit down hill. If you want a chance at a ten or bigger I would definately go to Last Mountain.Good Luck and Great Fishin'Russwww.getfish.net

509621,Guest,2000-09-13 11:15:00,0,30 in a day on Last Mountain is a great day. If you catch 10 it is a good day. But if you want big Walleye Last Mountain is the place. I have had some big fish in my boat this year.
