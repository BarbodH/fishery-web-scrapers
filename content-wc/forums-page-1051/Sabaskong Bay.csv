Monday we got 18 14-18 inch crappies at the elbow on Obabikin(sp) Lake. Tuesday got blown off the lake and Wensday filled out our possesion limits for eyes. spent Thursday and Friday just messing around doing only catch and release. Got a few more eyes. The lake should be good for this coming week. Target the weed lines in about 10-15 feet of water using chartruse(sp) lead heads with big minnows.Keep your rods bent!!Pops"
509737,Guest,2000-09-11 15:15:00,0,"Tell me more about the crappies. Were you specifically fishing for them or did you get them by ""accident""? Were you staying in Nestor Falls or an island resort? Thanks in advance for any info. I'm really into crappies and consider walleyes a bonus."
509738,Pops,2000-09-11 18:58:00,61,"We were staying at Mylie's Place just out of Morson.Yes we were after the crappies. Got them in Obabikin Lake at what is called the ""elbow"".Got them in 15-20 feet of water on crappie rigs with small minnows. They should also be hitting up on Thompson Creek on the northeast side of Miles Bay. We did not try there because there was already a bunch of boats there. I do not like to horn in.Keep your rod bent!!Pops"
509739,Guest,2000-09-12 17:23:00,0,"Pops, how was it getting into the elbow? Is the water high or low. Also when you were at thompson creek how many boats are you talking.More boats in the elbow or at thompson creek? Thanks and good fishing. PS going to run up on the 29th Sept and fish crappies for the day the go back to the riverfor those big eyes."
509740,Pops,2000-09-12 18:14:00,61,There was about 4-6 boats a Thompson last Friday when we were there. The water level is a little high. We had no trouble getting into Obabikin Lake with a Lund Barron 2100. Just make sure to raise the motor to get over the rocks.Only 2-3 boats at the elbow. We were the first ones there last Friday.Keep your rod bent!!Pops
