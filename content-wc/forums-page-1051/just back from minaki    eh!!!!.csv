The walleye fishing was the best I have ever seen in my 9 years of visiting the winnipeg river. We had a tough time getting fish under 18"". The fishing expedition began on Saturday for when we arrived it was hot and no wind. We caught around 40 fish for the half a day. The biggest was 29.5"". On Sunday, weather was still stable and caught over 150 walleye using spinners - again the same - tough catching fish under the 18"". Largest that day, 31.5"". Then the weather decided to make that ""big"" change and the winds picked up and the temperature dropped. Lightening, thunder, winds and temps in the mid 50's. Still caught really nice fish, but the frantic fish frenzy began to slow. Tuesday started to use the downriggers to depths of 45' and trolling cranks. Lots of 18"" to 20"", actually became boring catching the same fish over and over. Biggest that day - 25"". Remainder of the week, found new fishing ""hot"" spots and used spinners, jigs and lindys. Averaged 50 fish per day with the average size of 19"". The northern fishing was slow due to water temperature being too warm and the weeds were still in bloom. Caught a couple of 14lbs and a lot of little ones. Muskies really did not fish for because the Walleyes were so heavy. Had a nice one on and lost him, raised one ""dandy"". Returning on September 15th for another adventure in the ""Great North""! Thanks. Bill"

509687,iamwalleye1,2000-09-03 13:35:00,1589,"I have to put out a special thanks to mike @ lowrance, he shipped me a new unit the next day and only charged me $10.00 for shipping. I only used the radio if the lowrance was turned off. I am going to get somw ferrits from radio shack this week."
509688,Guest,2000-09-03 22:12:00,0,"Sounds like an outstanding trip!! Our group of us 4 will be up there at Birch Island Sept. 9. I like to bottom bounce alot. If you don't mind, what were you pulling your spinners with, what bait did you use, and at what depth? What areas were most productive? This will be my third trip this season, and I really enjoy Minaki. Did you all catch any smallies? Don (from TN)"
509689,iamwalleye1,2000-09-04 05:47:00,1589,"Well don, I am glad to see you enjoy fishing maybe this will make it a little easier for you. I have found once the water warms up the fish move deep. The best day we had was sunday, It was great, I pulled off wisky in about 37 to 45 feet. I use bottom bouncers almost all the time, except when my arm was so tired, then I will jig if the wind allows or troll. The 31.5 came off wisky (relesed), the 29.5 came off the hat rack (I tried relesing her she was bleeding very bad).I would say the best size fish you will find in big sand in about 40 feet. pickeral, green, and burnt. I have found you will not get any small fish off these location, all the fish are good sized. Have a good trip. please post how you do so others can use this message board. thanks bill"
509693,IaCraig,2000-09-04 22:57:00,434,"Super, I am always glad to hear of others successes. I live about 14 hours from Minaki, so I can only justify 1 trip per year (until the boys are big enough to go with). We had a great trip the 1st week of august there too. Sounds like we fish alot of the same areas, and we had tons of 18-21 inch fish too. But the 29+ inchers eluded us. I already have my reservations for next year. IaCraig"
509694,BobEaton1,2000-09-05 23:15:00,106,"Sure sounds like you had a great trip. We leave for minaki on thursday Sept 7th at 7 am. There are 14 of us this year. This will be 16 years in a row for me. I stay at Paradise Cove in house #1 right north of Jack's bait shop, can't miss us always hang a huge Nebraska Husker flag, white with red N on it. I run a Targa 2000 boat, White, red, and black and my name is Bob Eaton from Omaha,Ne. Last year I caught a 11.6lb Walleye and many smaller. We also caught tons of nice Northers and 5 Muskies, biggest 26lbs. So if any of you guys are up ther look me up, we monitor channel 61 on marine radios. Till later Good Fishing To All. Bob Eaton"
509690,Guest,2000-09-14 19:00:00,0,We just returned from Minaki today and had a good trip. The largest walleye we caught was around 28 inches. There was a 33 inch one caught in camp while we were there. Thanks for the tips. Don
509691,iamwalleye1,2000-09-14 19:51:00,1589,DONhow was the weather?? did you get any pike/musky? were the walleye's still deep? 'thanks I am leaving in the morning!! eh!!
509692,Guest,2000-09-15 07:11:00,0,"The walleye were 35 to 50 feet mainly. We caught 3 muskies, the largest was 45 inches. The weather was in the low 70's to upper 60's. One thing that we did that was different was to use a Wolf River rig with a 4 ounce weight and pull a bomber or rapala in 40 to 60 feet. This produced a 31 and 34 inch pike in short order. Good luck, Don"
