509727,Guest,2000-09-08 13:51:00,0,You might be out of luck for a lake in Ontario. Ice is usually forming at this time and may not be safe enough for ice fishing except in the northern areas. Early safe ice varies year to year. Try Rainy River between Lake of the Woods and Rainy Lake.

509729,Guest,2000-09-08 16:06:00,0,"Hi, I hear that the walleye fishing is quite good at this time of year on the Bay of Quinte as they come in from Lake Ontario to spend the winter. There shouldn't be any ice this early in November.Good luck, Mike."
