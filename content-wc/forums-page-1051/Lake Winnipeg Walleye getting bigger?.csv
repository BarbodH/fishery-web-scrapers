These large walleyes make an annual run up the Red & Winnipeg Rivers every fall. Apparently, biologists & commercial fisherman are confirming that the Walleyes are indeed getting bigger. As a matter of fact, the commercial catch on Lake Winnipeg was up 30% last season. The reason you say? Rainbow Smelt! Biologists suspect that they were introduced somewhere in Ontario years ago, and have slowly made their way down the Winnipeg River system into Lake Winnipeg. The past few years have seen their numbers increase dramatically, and the result could mean larger Walleyes in the coming years. One local , well-known, sportsman guessed that we could be seeing 15 -18 lb fish with increasing regularity in the future. While this could be a mixed blessing, it will be interesting to see what the long term impact of these non-native fish will be on the entire ecosystem."

Whatever the means, they seem to be correct in their assumption of the fish size increasing. As for the winter nets, all we can hope for is a high winds during freezeup creating an endless wall of jagged ice and lots of snow to insulate the thin ice making it very difficult for the people to get out on the lakes to net!"

509723,Backwater Eddy,2000-09-09 18:17:00,3871,"What is the report for the Winnipeg river, and the upper Red?I hear a few fish are in?On the smelt run, we used to key in on this on the Big Mo with deep diver Swithwick's Rouges in smelt patterns, anyone try these yet?Thank's..[email protected]Backwater Eddy...............><,,>"
