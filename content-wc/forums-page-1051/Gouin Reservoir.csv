509754,Guest,2000-09-11 20:20:00,0,Has anyone been up to Gouin Reservoir. I have heard rumors that the walleyes are fantastic!
509755,Guest,2000-09-12 13:41:00,0,"The walleye fishing on Gouin Reservoir IS excellent all season long. You will also catch some nice size pike. For a different way of doing things, rent a house boat rather than a chalet. Comes all equipped ; kitchen, bathroom, etc. Either way you will have a great time. Good luck,Mike."

509757,Guest,2000-09-12 20:08:00,0,"The Gouin res. is about 120 mi northeast of ValDor,Quebec. The Dore' fishing is very good, as is the Northern pike fishing. I dont know for sure, but I think fishing there in mid-late Nov. would involve an ice auger."

Gouin is a huge body of water dotted with thousands of islands with sandy beaches. Have a look at ""www.reservoir-gouin.com"". This is one of the many outfitters who operate out there.
