509779,MNNICK,2000-09-14 20:28:00,42,"hoghunter, was up there in the third week of July. Fishing wasn't real good but did alright. Lots of eaters and few pigs. Best one was 29.5, a few 25-27's. Had a tough time finding them. They really hadn't shown up in any numbers on the reefs and really didn't find any concentrations on the shorelines either. Fished Kilvert most of the time and quite a bit in Echo. Should have went a couple weeks later but this work crap gets in the way you know. Fun lake to fish but it can be cruel when they're tough to find. Have you been there recently? Would like to try it in the fall sometime, but where would a person begin to look for them?"
