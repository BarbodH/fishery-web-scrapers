Interested in basic fishing report, bait choice, key spots and anything else that may help make our first trip there more enjoyable. Is trolling allowed there? Any input would be great, Thanks - Dick"

Jigged alot with success also try harnesses with either bottom bouncers or egg sinkers. The walleye fishing can be tough at times, I think it gets a lot of pressure, however the northern fishing is usually good. Try the bays in the evening for northern use suicks or zarra spooks for some fun top water action.... Good luck and let us know how you do. I always stayed at Huber Lone Pine resort, which is an excellent place to stay it is in the channel btween the two lakes. Good Luck Sweed"

My wife and I caught over 200 fish during the week with many trophy size fish. We used walley divers, worm harnesses and jigge leeches. We stayed on the western end of the lake at Indian Point Camp which is run by a energetic owner. His site is at www.indianpointcamp.com. Comfortable, reconditioned cabins with modern docking facilities."
