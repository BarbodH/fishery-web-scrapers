Not as luxurious as the TETU but hey, your there to fish. It was funny.. all the guys from TETU came down by our camp, and we went up by there camp. go figure. white 1/2oz. jigs with minnows worked the best. Lots of small pike and gold ""silver minnows"" worked the best for larger Pike. disreguard the stories of Misquitto bay, the Pike are huge back there. Lots of small mouth at the falls. Use rattler crank baits for good action.I think you should consider KCR Camp. Last I knew it will cost about 500 for the american plan, and the food is really awesome."

Kinda frowned on using the indoor toilets...wanted you to use the outhouse's. If ya go...deffinetly talk to Rodney about the fishing...forget what anybody else says. He was really the only one who really tried to help us catch fish...he's the owner's adopted son (kind of?). We got guides all week, but they were a dispointment...never put us on walleyes, and shore lunch could have been better. Walleye fishing was terrible, but pike was good (our group caught 4 30"" that week) and smallmouth was OK. The weather was HOT and sticky and no wind...Never saw a drop of rain the whole week, so that kinda hurt the walleye fishin I think.Anyway...for the money...KCR is a nice place. there is a ton of water to fish, so the first time can be overwhelming, but I didn't think much of there guides...Good luck to ya!GOOD LUCK!!"

Always good action on the flats, by the point on the opposite side, and by Bass rock.Where is Mosquito Bay??Can't wait - be up there in a little more than 3 weeks!"

The cabins are great and the meals, can you say New York Strip or Prime Rib. If you ever have a chance to go you better do it. Its a trip of a lifetime."
