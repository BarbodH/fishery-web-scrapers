568033,Guest,2007-08-02 13:16:00,0,I have only seen one post on the condition of the 502. I presume that is a sign the 502 is in good shape.
568038,Guest,2007-08-02 14:08:00,0,best every. still some rocky patches about 1/2 way but just slow down a little. This road gets better every year.
568040,Guest,2007-08-02 15:28:00,0,Does not matter what the condition is--as long as I am on the road it means I have am going fishing or have been fishing in canada!! Grandpa use to go up when it was all dirt roads for 700 miles.
568041,Guest,2007-08-02 15:51:00,0,A group of guys just went through there last week with no problems. Just slow down where you see that the roadway needs work.

When we went thru in July, the northbound lane was fine the whole way. The southbound lane was rough for about 15 miles, about in the middle of the run, although it was not as bad as in the past, and the stretch of bad road was shorter than in past years, as noted above. This year was our 3rd trip with our boat up/down 502, a total of 700 miles each way on I-35, MN 33, US 53, 11, 502, 17 then 72. We had no more than 6000 miles total on the trailer, and we needed new tires when we got back. One was so bad it almost blew out on the road. Is it unusual for trailer tires to be so wimpy? Incidentally, parts of I-35 southbound north of the Cities are almost as bad as 502, in my opinion."
568049,Guest,2007-08-03 10:29:00,0,"The question....""are trailer tires wimpy"" answer ....YES. If you can replace a trailer tires with a 13""or 14' car tire on your trailer with slight modifications it is definately worth the effort and $$$$$."

Don't know whether it's that stretch of 502 or the few miles of gravel I have to travel, but twice now I've had one or both side bunks loosen up from the vibration. Someday I'll learn and bring more tools. :( :( Dave"
568058,Guest,2007-08-03 14:29:00,0,"You may want to think about getting a pair of Goodyear Marathon trailer tires. They cost a little more, but the end result is far better. I know what you talk about. I had a pair of bias ply tires on the trailer and you would not believe how these things wear out. The new tires don't even show the same wear patterns. If you had Carlisle tires on the trailer, forget about it. No more Carlisle for me and I don't care if they are on sale."
568060,Guest,2007-08-03 15:01:00,0,502 isnt all bad. Most sections are good except for all the curves. The middle section for about 20 miles is the roughest. Ive done the trip many times with and with out a trailor this year and the most concerned issue I have is the moose on the road. Keep an eye out for them esp during the night. 1 trip from Dryden to Fort Frances saw 8 moose during the evening hours. Acouple weeks ago even seen a wolf that wouldnt get off the road.
568061,Guest,2007-08-03 18:37:00,0,The rule for trailer tires is 5 years period even if they have zero miles.I change mine every 4 years. car tires on a trailer are a no no. if your car tire on a trailer causes an accident you could be in deep doo doo.
