Housekeeping rates are slightly higher than most but the facilities are superb and worth the small differential. American plan strikes me as very, very costly for what you get. Personally, My wife and I are changing venues next year and going back to housekeeping at a different resort which will save us about 60% over what I paid this year. A bit more hassle but I just can't justify the additional $1600 for 2 people under american."

If you like to fish with guides, the Wiley trip would be good for a family. If you want to explore on your own the Fireside trip is more conducive."
