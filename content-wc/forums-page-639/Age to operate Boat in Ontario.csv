I think you need to ask somebody in the MNR, but I don't think a 14yr old american can operate a boat in NWO. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
567309,Guest,2007-07-11 17:11:00,0,Hi. I think they are rewriting the boat operator rules and for some a license of sorts is needed depending on age. you can probably google the answer pretty quick.
