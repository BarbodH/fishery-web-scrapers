567911,Guest,2007-07-29 21:16:00,0,"It is gonbe, but a new program has replaced, very similar, but slightly different. Here is the site explaining ithttp://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/gi/no...tml#P399_52754"
567918,Guest,2007-07-30 08:10:00,0,The lodge we go to gave us the forms to send in.

The appropriate form to complete (to apply for the rebate) is available on the CRA web site, the form number is GST115 - see http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pbg/gf/gst115/gst115-e.pdf Non residents have 1 year, from the time of GST payment, to apply for the GST rebate. It is pointless to request a rebate of the GST at a border crossing because those employees are not empowered to deal with GST rebate issues."
567923,Guest,2007-07-30 10:52:00,0,"Skimmed this admittedly quickly, but is there a start date? We went in may, would that qualify?"
567935,Guest,2007-07-30 17:56:00,0,"can you still stop at the building in fort frances where they use to give out the gst rebates as in previous years, or do you have to fill out this form and send from home??"
567945,phishfearme,2007-07-31 07:43:00,1242,"kruger - the lodge should've only charged you half the GST in the first place - assuming you gave them a 20% deposit (see section 7.3 of the detailed FAQ page listed above). many outfitters did this under the previous program - maybe they haven't caught up yet - our outfitter charged us the full GST also. AND - when you fill out the form saying that you paid, say $60US in GST and request a $30US rebate, you'll get a check for $30CANADIAN. THEN, your bank will probably charge you a fee to cash/deposit a foreign check - so we loose twice. however, if the US continues it's weakness, we may be at an advantage here but i'll bet that'll change when to two dollars swap their strength. phish"
