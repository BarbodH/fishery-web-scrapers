568025,Guest,2007-08-02 08:48:00,0,Did anyone out there fish Obashi with Northern Outposts this Spring/Summer? I was just curious as to your experiences.
541876,phishfearme,2004-07-21 10:43:00,1242,"my four man group just returned from a 10 day ""week"" with northern outposts out of armstrong to their obashi lake outpost. the two groups booked before us cancelled so we had a relatively ""fresh"" lake. best way to summarize the fishing was jumbo perch! (we caught 70 over 11"" with 13"" being the largest), lots and lots of pike (pike to walleye ratio - no matter where you fished - was 8 to 1 on obashi and 2 to 1 at the portage lake, steel leaders were essential - notable were a 39.5 incher in obashi with the next largest at 29 inches and 36 and 35 inchers and 5 over 32 inches at the portage lake) and small, scattered walleye (average size is about 15 inches with 21 inches the largest) - not as good as we had hoped. one day at the portage lake, my buddy and i caught 55 walleye from 45 different spots with the largest being 18 inches. we couldn't find concentrations except when we walked to the next lake downstream (no boat) and waded into the water navel deep, but still nothing over 18 inches. the large cabin, boats and motors were excellent (best equipped cabin we've found) and the outfitter did everything you'd expect from an outfitter. this trip was abit on the expensive side (about $1400 for 10 days) due significantly to the long flight. more details? just ask. - phish"

No concentrations of walleye? Have you heard/had any experiences with the outpost since your 04 trip? We've been to several outposts in Ontario and simply enjoy the experience of new outfitters and places."
566117,Mr. Walleye,2007-06-10 09:22:00,74,"Hi Phish I'm wondering if you hit the post-spawn. We were at Obashi about 5 years ago in mid-June and had awesome walleye fishing; very few pike would bother us although we did catch several in the 35+ range while walleye fishing. Average size walleye was 17-18 inches with countless fish over 20. We probably averaged 100-150 walleyes per boat per day. Ryan and Kathy run great outposts! We're trying something new out of Red Lake this year. As you mentioned, price has gotten a little too much for us. Thanks for the report!"
566174,phishfearme,2007-06-11 19:38:00,1242,"mrW - glad to hear you did well there. we were there in early july so it wasn't post spawn. if anything it was weeds. some of the bays - which are pretty shallow anyway, were pretty thick with weeds and we had abit of a tough time finding open water that held fish. it seems to me that obashi is an early season lake - like when you were there. the perch were pretty special though! so where you going outta red lake? we always look for additional options. phish"
566226,Mr. Walleye,2007-06-12 20:26:00,74,Hi Phish I didn't realize yours was an old post from July of '04. I thought you just got back from there. Our trip to Obashi was in mid-June of '01. We're flying in to Hy-Vee Lake with Medicine Stone Resort & Outposts this year. I'll post a report when we get back. Leaving in 2 days!
566227,Mr. Walleye,2007-06-12 20:27:00,74,S You'll love Obashi in June. Was there in '01. See my other post.
566710,Guest,2007-06-27 15:18:00,0,"Mr. Walleye, Thanks, I'm sure we will love it! We have heard only good things concerning Northern Outposts! Tough question, have you run into any patterns for larger walleye in these way north Canadian Lakes? We've been to many fly in trips where we catch lots of good walleye (18-20) but seem to have problems finding the bigger/biggest fish in the lake. We have picked up some good fish over the years but have never found a concentration of big fish like some people speak of. Any suggestions from anyone?"

566713,phishfearme,2007-06-27 17:50:00,1242,"S - some thoughts about your question. it's my opinion - and i think most MNR studies confirm this - is that these way north lakes just don't hold large numbers of large walleye - let me define large here as a true 24incher (not a 22incher that is commonly called a 24incher). the growth season is just too short and typically there's not alot of deep water to maintain a large population of large fish in the winter. also, a true 18-19incher is typically about 10 years old - old age for a walleye - can't imagine how old a 24incher would be but 20 years old wouldn't surprise me. i've never fished lac seul but it seems that lake is about at the northern limit of where larger+ walleye can be reasonably expected to be caught. it is also hugh and deep as it's a manmade reservoir. we've been doing flyin trips for over 20 years and have hit dozens of lakes and we're always happy to tie into a few true 23-24inchers (accurately measured with a bump board) and when we got two 27inchers and a 26incher from bow lake a few years ago we were elated. these jumbos were caught mixed in with a mess of nice 16-17inchers and we were doing nothing special - just plain old twister jigs. at obashi we got very few eye's over 18inches and we thought that we'd may be able to find some larger ones in the deeper areas (which aren't that deep maybe 12ft) trolling some diving lures - but no luck - just more 15-17inchers. just my nickels's worth, phish"
