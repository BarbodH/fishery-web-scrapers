It depends if your gonna stay on the American side or the Canadian side, which is the side I am on. I fish mainly Manitou Rapids and the Long Sault Rapids and I don't know some people who don't know the actual name call it Birchdale Rapids. Both are very good but I have to admit, Manitou is better. If you stay on the Canadian side, Emo Inn has rooms in Emo which is 5 minutes from Manitou. Emo has a boat launch as well as Barwick. Jig and minnow usually do the trick but sometimes I go over to Baudette and buy frozen shiners. Crank baits work as well as berkley power baits. email me for more info [email protected] or [email protected]"
567947,Lovetofish,2007-07-31 09:11:00,458,I fished up there the last weekend in October last fall. We satyed in a motel off the water by Baudette. All we did was anchor in the river and at the gap. Used a verticle jig (gold) with a dead shiner. Bring your long underwear. I hope to go back this fall.
567950,ii4me,2007-07-31 10:57:00,20,We will be there on the weekend of Oct. 6th. Can't wait as fishing is usually pretty good that time of year. From the mouth of the river all the way up stream.
