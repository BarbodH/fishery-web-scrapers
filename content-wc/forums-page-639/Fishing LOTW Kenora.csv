567804,bigbuck,2007-07-26 12:00:00,69,My father in law lives up there and has said that the fishing is fantastic. All depends on what you want to fish for and where you are. Good luck.

567895,Guest,2007-07-29 09:33:00,0,Any Walleye Fishing Reports ???????
567931,bigbuck,2007-07-30 16:31:00,69,"What sort of contacts are you looking for?? Lodges, camps, guides?? I have the number of a couple of guides, depends on what you want to fish for. As for lodges, Witch Bay and Smith Camps are good places from what I've heard, we've gone to Smith Camps for dinner and drinks a couple of times and the food was great. There is also Redden's right on Highway 17 outside of Kenora that is a great campground but it's on Longbow Lake (you can access LOTW). Good fishing."
