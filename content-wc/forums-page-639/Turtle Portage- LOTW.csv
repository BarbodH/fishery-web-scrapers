568010,Guest,2007-08-01 19:26:00,0,We drove down to check it out. Anyone know if you can get a 21' Pro V over it? Looked pretty good just don't know if a couple people can crank her over. If so would like to make the loop next year from Sioux Narrows. Thanks!! Dennis

One problem in the past has been when the water is low, the wheels on the ""trolley"" may run beyond the track, i,e., the wheel stop is not very functional. The jammed condition then makes it very difficult to use. This then makes it inoperable for the next guy; just don't be ""the next guy"". I haven't seen it for several years, but that is what I understand. I've read that smaller boats have been using it this year. Good luck,"
