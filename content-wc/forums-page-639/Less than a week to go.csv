We go up with two families and always have a great time. Some years the fishing is pretty good and others we have a harder time finding the fish. We always seem to get enough for a couple of dinners and a pack of fish to bring home. The lake we go to has nice walleye, perch and bass in it. There are a few pike that we catch once in a while. We are on the 4th set of owners. The place has fallen into disrepair the last few years but we still go back. We have seen the less than full problem the last 3-4 years. I hope the owners put some money and time back into the cabins. Even the web page has 2005 specials on it still!! I can see the lake now, fresh cup of coffee in one hand and the worm container in the other. Can get a few drifts in before everyone else in camp wakes up. How many days till we go again?"

They are stuffed in there good. Clears up needed floor space on the boat by eliminating the need for tackle boxes. Sometimes I wonder why I take enough jigs to outfit 10 guys, but you never know what the hot color or size might be. I also have an ample supply of worm harness materials as well. I used those pool noodles to make holders and now have 4 of them. They work pretty good. I also have a large supply of small ziplock bags full of harnesses. Then there are the boxes of crankbaits and Rapelas. A guy can never have enough of them. Saturday morning cannot get here fast enough!!!"

Nothing beats that first cup of coffee in the morning except maybe the stories at the end of the day. We also went to a camp that began to fall into disarray. We continued to go there for many years because the other families became our friends and we`d look forward to seeing them. But the lake became more developed, the competition for fishing spots went up, the fishing went down and the owners were thinking of selling so we moved on to a new camp. The new camp owners were aiming to please and the facilities were much better for about the same price. We were afraid to try someplace new because we`d been burned before but I`m glad we did. As long as you`re happy with it, thats what counts. BTW, what size and color spinner blades do you use? We always had best luck with silver, thumbnail size using nightcrawlers. And if we caught more than two, the jigs came out. Good luck next week. Lazyk"

Some years bright chartruse, green or orange seem to catch a few fish. Last year it was red/orange beads with copper blade with watermelon tape in green on one blade and red on the other blade. Medium sized blades a little larger than a thumb nail. I have not had much luck with the hatchet shaped blades to date."
