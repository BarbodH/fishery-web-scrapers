566965,Guest,2007-07-03 21:31:00,0,I am going to fish cedar lake in manitoba in aug.I have been there before looking for new spots to fish walleye thank you.
566980,Guest,2007-07-04 09:34:00,0,"great place to stay. I think I have some coordinates still. the best spot to catch eyes on cross bay is a place called sugar island. its right where cedar lake dumps into crossbay, its where the original river chanel is. the northwest corner of that island has been really good to us for nice eyes.but be carefull on the way down there for floaters and reefs.also try seaplane reef, gull island, and a bouy on the south end of the bay."
