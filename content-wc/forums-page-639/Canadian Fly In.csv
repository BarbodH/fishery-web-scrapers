Prefer to fly from just N of the border(within 100-300 miles or so). We are mainly after Walleyes, but wouldnt mind othere species too. Prefer to be the only cabin on the lake. We would prefer an outfitter that will fly our ""beverages"" in in advance, maybe bait and food too. Would like hot showers, and decent boats. We are leaving from Nebraska/Iowa so would probably have to be In Ontario,Manitoba, or Eastern Sask. would like to keep price(outfitter) under 1300 per man. Thanks!"

My kids like lots of pop, L & M is willing to take my beverages in before our arrival. They also said they would do the food too but I think we'll be good on weight as long as our beverages are in ahead of time.www.lmflyin.com"

Great fishing for walleyes and northerns; I have fished Kapikik, McVicar, Bertrand and Antenna lakes. My group of 6 caught and released 1,742 walleyes in one week on Bertrand, I don't know how walleye fishing can get any better. Call them 807/222-2197 or you can ask me any questions [email protected] Terry"

Sometimes we have them bring in sodas or potatoes, etc, mid week on the camp check. They will bring in ice mid week also. Let them know your wishes and they will do what they can to help you out."
568066,Guest,2007-08-03 20:21:00,0,We have used Excellent Adventures for the last six years and have had great service. If you're there for a week they will also bring in more in addition to taking items in advance. Most of his outposts are the only one on the lakes.
