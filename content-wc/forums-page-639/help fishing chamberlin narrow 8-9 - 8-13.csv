I was in there and I was in map heaven. There is no way I will ever use all the maps I bought but, just in case, I'm prepared."

A few weeks ago in the Chamberlain are, they were in about 15 to 25 feet, but spread out because there was little wind and when it blew it was from a different direction each day. The walleye were everywhere in that water depth on the flats near structure, but in smaller numbers than usual. We got a 26, 27 and a 30."
