I've been going to western ontario for some years now but next year i want to take my sons 12,10, and i could drive to that area in about 9-10 hrs versus 20 or more. By looking at the map it seems the closest area for decent fishing? We are in wv, and yes these are my kids and not with my sister!!! Would like to cast for northerns, bass and jig some walleyes to eat so any help on areas, fishing methods or camps is greatly appreciated and mostly camps that either offer kids discounts or activities, thanks."

Its 110 square miles of semi-wilderness islands with campsites. Its adjacent to the town of MacTier, ON. Do a search on ""Massasauga"" and you will find more info at the Ontario MNR website. I camped & fished there last year & loved it. Its very similar to NW Ontario. The park is south of Parry Sound. Also, there are many nice resorts & motels near Parry Sound & Honey Harbour. Can't go wrong there either. Also, there are many fine fishing resorts at all price points on the French River. The lower French is my favorite but, its on the high priced side due to the limited access. Good pike fishing on the lower French. We stayed at Bear's Den Lodge. Be aware that all of these areas are within a few hours drive for sportsmen living in the metro-Toronto area. Getting early reservations where-ever you go is crucial. Parry Sound is a busy little town during the warm weather months."

There are only 7 trailers there and 3 are owned by people from Buffalo NY. On any given weekend you will see plates on cars parked outside the cabins from Ohio, Penn, Ill, Ga. Bass, Pike, Walleye and Musky are in the waters there. You can see the website here http://www.bayfieldlodge.com/ Dave"
