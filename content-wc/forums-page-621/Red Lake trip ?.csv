571779,AllenW,2008-02-29 14:23:00,11482,"Thanks all for the suggestions, resorts have gotten a bit spendy haven't they? :) Fishing buddy and I decided we're gonna camp at Ralfs, not fond of it, but temp wise I figure it can't be much different than the last week in Sept and we have enough cold weather gear incase it snows. Anyway, if your in the area the last week in May, stop by, we'll be the two old farts huddled by the fire...:) Al"

Private cabin. http://www.cottageads.com/index.php?page=out&id=387 I've stayed there a few times when friends come up to visit. Nice place. A fisherman's paradise... But only room for 2 maybe 3 people. CHEERS, Mista W"
571795,AllenW,2008-03-01 08:40:00,11482,"Thanks Mista W, but the guy I'm going with is pretty tight for funds right now and the $18 a day plus $6 docking is a lot cheaper, we still have a whole summer after that and a fall trip is possible. We'll keep it in mind though, once again, thanks. Al"
571797,Pooch,2008-03-01 09:56:00,4619,"Mista Walleye.... Is this cabin just past Green's about a half mile? It looks familier. Shoot me an email MrW, I've some questions for you and the Red Lake area. Pooch"
571799,Bill Krejca,2008-03-01 12:14:00,6107,"well, one thing about camping that time of the year is that usually the bugs are not as bad as alittle later on."
571808,Guest,2008-03-02 12:00:00,0,"Yes Pooch, That's the cabin. Georgeous view. Mista W"

571681,AllenW,2008-02-27 06:27:00,11482,"Our late fall, now early spring trip to Red lake has run into a snag...:) Last time we were at Red lake we stayed in a RV the the Chukuni River campgrounds had for rent, they no longer have this option and we're not to fond of camping anymore, (I'm 60) so we looking at possibly staying somewhere else on the lake. Any suggestions on a reasonable place for two guys to stay? We won't go to Howie Bay, but are up for most anything else. I'll check the web also, but nice to get a recommendation from somebodies who's been there. Tia Al"
571684,freespoolin,2008-02-27 07:25:00,472,"Sunset Lodge, we've been staying there for 11 years. Rene and Adele are great people. They have a website. Google will find it."
571687,AllenW,2008-02-27 08:39:00,11482,"I had forgot about sunset, we stayed there many years ago and was a nice place, thanks Al"
571689,Goldeneagle,2008-02-27 08:45:00,78,Rene is a super camp owner. Better than most. What's going on with Ralf at Chukuni?
571691,Guest,2008-02-27 08:58:00,0,I would look into Bow Narrows Camp. It's a boat in camp on the west end of the lake. It's on the west side of the narrow between main Red Lake and Pipestone Bay so you never loose fishing day due to wind. The owners are great and the price you can't beat. I believe the web site is www.bownarrows.com. John L
571693,Guest,2008-02-27 09:05:00,0,"If you are just looking for lakefront accomadations. there was info in our Fall classic package, about a place right on Howey bay That offers overnight and extened stay for people coming to Red Lake. They have a website www.onredlake.com my wife and I are thinking about staying there to prefish before the tournament."
571723,Guest,2008-02-27 11:36:00,0,I've been told in the past that Ralf was renting out RV that belonged to Americans that is a NO NO! up here. Somebody might of turned him in.
571724,AllenW,2008-02-27 12:13:00,11482,"I talked to Carol and she says the RV's got to be to much trouble with having to run the nursery (plants, not kids) and they got rid of them. Late May is just a bit to early to camp for us old folks...:) Thanks for the suggestions Al Thanks Bigjohn, but boat in resorts usually have to many restrictions for us, and this one does too, looks like a nice place if I didn't already have a boat though."
571726,Goldeneagle,2008-02-27 12:34:00,78,Maybe give Dave another try at Howey Bay. Bev's getting too old to cause you much grief. Tag your fish though. Surely someone wouldn't steal a tagged fish with your name on the tag.
571728,AllenW,2008-02-27 13:30:00,11482,"Ya, been long enough I should just forget it, could happen to anybody, it was Bev's attitude that really PO'd me off. btw we had our names on each package of fish, they helped themselves while we were out fishing. Funny thing is, we ain't all that hard to get a long with and if they were having trouble catching fish, we'd have taken them to a spot or two, or we'd of filled their limits for them worst case. All they had to do was ask..go figure Buddy wants to camp at Ralf's, personally I think he's nuts, but it would be cheaper.. We'll see. Anybody up at Red the last week in May? Al"
