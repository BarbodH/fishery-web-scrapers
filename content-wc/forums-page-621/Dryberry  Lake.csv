Supposedly no walleyes, ""just"" enormous muskies & numerous lake trout & smallies...http://www.walleyes.org/muskies/dryberry.htm"
571419,Guest,2008-02-14 21:18:00,0,"Hi Robert, I fish Dryberry a lot. It is a tough nut too crack but it is a great lake to fish. Like skin said no walleyes and it does have a great trout fishery and as for musky and smallies. The proof is in the pudding. Just be prepared to put your time in. Also access is a road on the west side of the lake will take you about 45mins to an hour to get in. If you have anymore questions shoot me an e-mail."

I should have posted on the Musky board,so, I'll just say thank you to all the walleye guys."

It would be interesting to talk to you about how you fish the lake. We've done really well there everytime we've went. Send me an e-mail sometime ([email protected]). Cory"
