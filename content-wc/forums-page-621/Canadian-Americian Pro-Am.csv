571757,Guest,2008-02-28 17:40:00,0,Your wrong check out the PWT.
571766,Guest,2008-02-29 08:21:00,0,"I'm not sure, but this is what I based my comment on. Checking the PWT site, I don't see anything definitive otherwise.... ""I've just got off the phone with Jim Kalkofen and wanted to get this out as soon as possible. There have been all kinds of rumors about the PWT and whether or not they would have a tour. The reason for the late news is because of high powered contract negotiations between long term companies, Mercury Marine and Lund boats. It sounds like final decisions have been made and remember that I'm reporting what I've heard and there will most likely be some final tweaks of the details as this progresses. Here goes. Mercury and Lund, have decided not to participate in the PWT. In and of itself, this would most likely be reason for the PWT not to proceed, however the decision has been made to go ahead with the tour. There will be four regionals (dates have already been announced) and instead of the Super Pro in Dryden, Ontario there will be a Super Pro Can Am tournament. The Can Am will consist of 25 USA Anglers and 25 Canadian Anglers. John Butts is the Canadian team captain and he will chose those anglers. I've been chosen as the USA Captain and will choose the USA anglers. I'm sure that some guys will be happy and some guys will get really mad at me. Fortunately the team Captains will be voted on by the members for subsequent years. Kind of like the Ryders Cup in Golf. Entry fees for the Can Am are proposed to be $1500. Paybacks will be posted shortly (I've been promised). Regional tournament will have a proposed $1550 entry fee. There will be no Championship, however Angler of the Year will have significant money paid down a number of spots (as soon as this is finalized I'll post) Angler of the Year will be based on points from the Regional tournaments only. They are shooting for a payback in the 115% range with cash payback instead of boats. I've heard the proposed payback and over all it's pretty good. I'll post as soon as it's finalized and that may be as soon as this afternoon. This means that the PWT and their owners (InterMedia) have decided that the PWT is very important to them... enough to put in their own money. Overall this is good news for those of us who have fished this tour for a long time. Also the word is that Mercury will be offering an incentive to their Mercury Anglers. I actually know the amounts, but need confirmation with Mercury before I can post. Now I know that this news is going to spread rapidly and I'll try to answer as many questions as possible, however I'm only going to do it on this site. For those of you that frequent Walleye Central and Walleyes First, please realize that I'm not slighting those sites in any way... I only have time for monitoring this site. So again if questions arise please direct to me here. I'll update with information about paybacks, etc as soon as it's official. Also I would like to field the strongest USA team possible. That means that I'll be contacting some of you heavy hitters on the FLW. Thanks and let the gossip begin!!! Best Fishes Gary Parsons"""
