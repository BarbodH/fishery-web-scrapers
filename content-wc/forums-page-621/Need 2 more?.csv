Great place, though we did not get to meet the new owners who took over the year after we quit going. We had some great days fishing off Devils' Point there. My brother and I would love to take you up on that, but the week you go won't allow it. We got to Pakwash now 2 weeks later."

571690,Goldeneagle,2008-02-27 08:48:00,78,Good luck filling a hole on the internet. I did it one time with one guy and it was a monumental blunder on my part. Lots of good luck to you.

571727,Guest,2008-02-27 12:36:00,0,"Try and get together to discuss the trip or at least several phone calls to make sure everybody knows the ground rules. I could easily see a disaster on the horizon, or a fishin buddy for life."

One last thing I'd recommend is to check them out on CCAP. In WI almost all municipal code violations, criminal and civil activities in the state are recorded there. Nice to know if you're going with an ax murderer, or somebody with a DUI history that could mess you up at the border."

That must make for some fun stories now that its behind you goldeneagle. I can just imagine being at camp for a week with some moron that everyone wants to kill and you invited him!! LOL
