571897,Guest,2008-03-07 12:03:00,0,"Wow! You're gonna eat those words. Are the Cyclowns a dynasty now? Must not have heard about that one. Of course I live more than 20 miles from Ames, so I guess I wouldn't have.:boxing: JohnB.O.A.T."
571902,Filson,2008-03-07 13:33:00,10,"Come on John!! You have to be more clever than Cyclowns, don't you? Clown Little Brother Catsup & Mustard Lames Give me something I haven't heard before!! :cheers:"
571914,Guest,2008-03-07 16:03:00,0,"I've got it but this is a family site. I'd hate to get the boot from the big bad administrator. Besides if you've been a 'Clone since the Donnie Duncan era you've had enough abuse. So, be nice or I'll send the division II UNI panthers over there to give you guys a whoopin...........again. Good luck in your games.......except for the one in Iowa City. JohnB.O.A.T."

571916,Filson,2008-03-07 16:44:00,10,I'll give you one last shot and it is weak. UNI would have kicked Western Michigan's a$$. Great fishing to you. And sincere thanks for the info about the border crossing.

571943,Hump,2008-03-09 09:26:00,578,"I agree with UNI in football!. I got my masters at Drake, so..go dogs. I believe the Hawks are 1 ahead this spring over ISU. We have kicked two players off!"

571838,Obabikon,2008-03-04 08:01:00,2370,ALmost all two lane highways... won't be the worst ride... Very little traffic in the area all the times I've been through.
571839,Obabikon,2008-03-04 08:01:00,2370,"Oh, and the roads themselves are usually in pretty good shape."
571843,Filson,2008-03-04 18:34:00,10,Thanks for all of your input and information. 15 short weeks to go until our trip.
571844,Bill Krejca,2008-03-05 06:47:00,6107,"I now always cross at Baudette when heading to the Nestor Falls area. Last fall was the longest wait- we had 4 cars ahead of us. Usually there are 1 or 2, sometimes none. The official folks on both sides of the crossing are friendly, but business-like, perhaps they don't get the hassles they get at IF, or else they just handle it better."
571846,Guest,2008-03-05 11:19:00,0,"End of June of 2007, the cars were backed up all the way to U.S.A. soil."
571847,2746,2008-03-05 12:26:00,3206,"Have been going up to Lac Suel or Gullrock 2-3 times per year for the past 10 years. Trips are in May, August and September. We cross at Ft. Frances going up late Friday afternoon and cross coming back mid morning on Saturday and have never been in a wait more than 30 minutes and most are shorter. Last year in august we left on Friday and crossed back into U.S. mid morning and still no wait. Is it just the Friday PM time that creats the long lines? As to Baudette, we have tried it a couple of times and it adds about 90 minutes for us back to the twin cities and about 80 miles. Nice change in scenery however."
571850,Filson,2008-03-05 12:47:00,10,"I think that it is the month of June that does it. It has been 2-3 hours the last 3 years on the 3rd Friday of June at the Ft. Francis crossing. It was 3 full hours last year. Going 3 times per year would be way too cool. We used to go twice, but I got tired of missing ISU football games in the fall."
571853,2746,2008-03-05 13:39:00,3206,"Wow, an ISU fan! I'm an alumni as well but not a season ticket holder although I do go to several. Our trip last fall was in Sept and we missed two games......but the fishing on Lac Suel was excellent. It's a tough choice!"
571870,Filson,2008-03-06 08:55:00,10,"Excellent!! ISU '89 for me. I am quite involved in Cyclone football these days. If you ever need assistance with tix, parking passes, info, etc...just shoot me a note. I love to help anyone I can get back the Jack."
571885,Hump,2008-03-07 07:22:00,578,How is ISU'S baseball team going to be this spring?
571804,Filson,2008-03-02 06:25:00,10,Does this back up like the Fort Francis crossing? Last June we took 3 hours in line to cross at approximately 2 in the afternoon on Friday. We are willing to take the scenic route home through north central MN if the crossing is worth it. Thanks in advance for any info.
571805,Obabikon,2008-03-02 06:57:00,2370,"No it doesn't. I've been crossing there my entire life, and have never seen it more than 4-5 cars deep."
571806,Guest,2008-03-02 08:08:00,0,"I agree with Obabikon. Every year our wait has been at least 2 hours on the way back home. (no matter what time of day) Very early or late, it doesn't matter. Figure 2 hours minimum. Last year I went on a 2nd trip with the whole family and a buddy's family. He has always told me I was nuts for crossing at Ft. Francis. We got to Baudette and the ""line"" was 2 cars deep going up and we drove right up to the window on the way home. I have now got the ""guys' fishing trip to at least try it on the way home this June. If it works we'll use it both ways. It depends on what lake you are going to, but if it's about the same way at either crossing I'd choose Baudette. Plus you won't get tempted to run into Border Bob's and blow another $100.00!! Keep'er on the bottom......... JohnB.O.A.T."
571815,bpetersen,2008-03-02 19:41:00,251,Baudette in June is the way to go. I can ditto everyone else's response. Not as many motels and places to eat but crossing is fast and painless. Pete
571822,Obabikon,2008-03-03 05:45:00,2370,"To add about the hotels... the Americ Inn is a very adequate hotel. Clean, pool, hot tub... But, without a doubt, there Baudette is a smaller town than International Falls."
571828,Rose_Cliff Lake,2008-03-03 12:16:00,116,I've crossed there once. No vehicles except ours. AND they were FRIENDLY!!!
571829,Glenman12,2008-03-03 13:12:00,762,That crossing does sound inviting..but it seems to me that it would probably save time for those going north on 71 but not those going north on 502..maybe Im wrong..has anyone figured out how much time was saved versus how many more miles travelled?
571830,Mohleye,2008-03-03 13:35:00,368,"That's kind of hard to do, because the time saved depends on how long you would have to sit in line at Ft Frances. We tried it for the first time last year, and I'd say it added about an hour of travel time, but there was not one car in line, we drove right up to the customs office, mid-morning on a Saturday. We enjoyed trying something new, seeing some different country, and not sitting in line. We will probably do it again this year."
571833,Guest,2008-03-03 17:08:00,0,"from Itnl falls add an hour going to baduette and then add another hour to go back to fort francis. so do you want to sit in line for 2 hours or drive for 2 hours. the folks definitely are friendlier at baudette going and coming , but you dont get the ambiance of the paper mill odor. boy I miss that."
571837,Filson,2008-03-04 07:15:00,10,"First of all, thanks to all of you for the information. We will be using the crossing coming home. Now, I have a question about the roads in Northern Minnesota. We will take Hwy's 72 to Hwy 1 to Hwy 46 to Hwy 169 and the crash for the night at the Grand Casino Mille Lacs. Any information of the condition of these roads? Thanks in advance."
