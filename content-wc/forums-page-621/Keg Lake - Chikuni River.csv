I'm not privy to the details. Anyone want to share a few hotspots on Red Lake, Keg or the Chikuni River? I'm getting too old for this."

Few more details may help, like kind of boat, how far ya want to go, what your fishing for, etc. Red is a big lake and you can spend a lot of time traveling it. Places like Forestry Point can produce nice walleys and northerns, but it can get a bit rough if its windy, There's also the dam on the Chukuni river, but get there very early, it'll be crowded in July, as your looking at the dam fish up close to it and on the left side, we use jigs and minnows. imho Also from Ralf,s go under the bridge and out maybe a couple hundred yards and fish to your right, not sure about July, but in Sept it produces walleyes, mostly under slot, but you'll hit more of them, good for kids I guess.
