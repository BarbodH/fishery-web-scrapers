I'm not filled up for the opener... but I am filled the end of May. You're right about May being more difficult. But, your original post said May and the first week in June. Seems in our area, the last week in May and first two weeks in June are by far the most popular weeks of the entire season. Maybe it changes lake to lake, and camp to camp. I'll take the ""I highly doubt that you are filled up to capacity for May"" comment as misreading my post. My last week in May is full, not all of May... if you don't believe me, you can call and try to book under a fake name. I will regretfully have to decline your business. Just a couple more months and we'll be on the lake... I'm getting some cabin fever!"
571763,Obabikon,2008-02-28 21:21:00,2370,"I'll also show some honesty... the last two weeks in June, I'm not even at half capacity."
571782,Rich J,2008-02-29 18:36:00,65,"Heck, thats not hearsay! I figure if your not going or not coming back with fish there is no reason for me to go. Rich J"
571682,jigman 2003,2008-02-27 06:28:00,981,"If you ever try booking a fly in trip the first week of June, you better get lucky. It took me 6 years to work my way into the 3rd week of June with my previous outfitter. Probably would have taken another 4 or 5 to get the first week."
571685,Guest,2008-02-27 07:33:00,0,"I don't go to this lake, but the lake I do go to also has openings in May and June. I have never seen this before, they are usually full. Maybe less people going up because of the prices."
571688,Goldeneagle,2008-02-27 08:41:00,78,"Have been flying in the third Saturday of May every year beginning in 1984. I usually go in a few days or up to a week earlier when there's a ride. The rewards have been great. Scheduled to go in May 16 and out May 31 this year, but will probably make it earlier since I'll be traveling alone and will meet another group each week. I hope to be on the water while there's still a few hundred acres of ice floating around. It's a time of change, mostly great changes."
571695,Hump,2008-02-27 10:01:00,578,"Just curious: Where do you normally fish for Northerns on that end of the lake. We had consistantly been hit by big northerns around the mouth of the Wenesaga, that was in late June. We are coming up late July this year."
571710,Guest,2008-02-27 10:39:00,0,"I have talked to lots of outfitters in the area and I agree it is not odd at all. Depends on the lake you're on for one thing. Some lakes just do not produce in the early part of the season. People worry about the weather (it is Canada you know), want to come when their kids are out of school - many factors."

571732,Rose_Cliff Lake,2008-02-27 16:05:00,116,"I'm quite pleased with May and June so far. Even July is doing well. I have some openings, but these months ,so far, are booked best."
571735,Rich J,2008-02-27 19:26:00,65,"Hump It is really weather dependent. We often fish the back door (bay before the sancturary), Sawmill, Iron Creek. Shallow bays that get sunshine work well. If it stays cold then it becomes tough. Usually we don't go much past Goose. Mostly we use spoons or 6"" white paddle tails on a 3/4 oz jig head. Sometimes the weather doesn't cooperate but the good times make up for the bad and I always enjoy going. Rich J"
571738,Guest,2008-02-27 21:26:00,0,There is a rumor about camp that he doesn't go out until about 10:30 in the morning on good days. I've even heard there are some days he doesn't untie the boat from the dock at all. This is all hearsay though.
571759,walleye54,2008-02-28 19:20:00,8,We spend the first two weeks at Evergreen every year. Great fishing with great owners and camp. They have always been booked in the past.
571664,Guest,2008-02-26 13:39:00,0,"Just confirmed my reservations for the last week of May at Lac Seuls Evergreen and was told they have several openings for that week and first week of June. I always preferred that time, big fish are hungary after spawn, family vacations hadn't started yet. Camp is for hard core fishermen at that time, no bugs! Am I missing something by going early?"
571668,Guest,2008-02-26 14:25:00,0,Nope....best week to go...very few paople around.That is my favorite week in the spring...Also last week in Sept. for the same reason
571669,lacseulwalleyeguide,2008-02-26 15:54:00,32,"I agree with Peepers. There has never been a big rush to Canada for May or the first week in June. I have established my dedicted hardcores, and they are rewarded with trophies each year. This is the most exciting time of year...hunting big walleyes in shallow water. I feel that it is the fear of late ice out, or weather that deters people away from this time frame. I just think that in this day and age, and the incredible clothing and equipment that is available now, weather should not matter. I have not experienced too many openers in which the weather was too brutal to fish in my time. I do appreciate the peacefulness of it all for now...one day they will all discover how good it is!"
571671,prov1900,2008-02-26 16:39:00,544,I'll be on Minnitaki that same week. Same time last year. Awesome time to go. Of course I am sweating a little with ice out.
571672,Hump,2008-02-26 16:44:00,578,"if you have never stayed at Evergreen, you will enjoy it. Let us know how you do."
571674,Obabikon,2008-02-26 17:38:00,2370,">I agree with Peepers. There has never been a big rush to >Canada for May or the first week in June. That's odd, because almost all resort owners are full the first week in June. Infact, the last week in May and the first two weeks in June, I'm completely full already. Most fishermen know that's right after the walleye spawn. Also, the kids are right out of school, and you beat any chance of major heat. Some people don't like to come up for walleye opener, because if it's a cold spring, you may be there a little early. Also, the weather can be very unpredictable. Just my 2 cents."
571675,v-bay gord,2008-02-26 19:05:00,3168,"Obabikon......""thats odd, most camps are full""......well, Gary at Evergreen is obviously one of the honest ones. Don't believe half of what other camp owners tell you, and you will almost have the truth. There are plenty of openings, don't kid yourself."
571676,Rich J,2008-02-26 19:25:00,65,"Never too early, we will be coming back from two weeks at Evergreen that weekend. We like to go the week before opener and fish for Northern, then hit the walleyes opening week. Rich J"
571678,Obabikon,2008-02-26 20:12:00,2370,"I'm sure there's openings at a lot of resorts right now for those time slots. But, it's my understanding that the last week in may, first two weeks in June are infact the most popular weeks of the season. And, I've heard that's true just about everywhere. Maybe I'm wrong, but that's what the ""that's odd"" comment was about."
571679,lacseulwalleyeguide,2008-02-26 20:33:00,32,"June is packed for us as well, and yes the first week, but I highly doubt that you are filled up to capacity for May, as this is one of the tougher areas to market, although there a quite a few trips, definetly not full."
