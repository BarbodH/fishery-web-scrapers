571811,Guest,2008-03-02 14:25:00,0,the zealots are out today. they are almost as bad as the litterbugs.
571813,Guest,2008-03-02 19:06:00,0,"Anti-smokers like smokers. We are a target for their rage. Can't fight the main polluters but you can scream at the little guy huddled in the cold with his smoke and blame all the world's problems on him. I have not smoked in a year but there are still self-righteous people I will not tell. Sure some smokers are slobs and throw their butts around. Some non-smokers dump their garbage on back roads rather than wait for the dump to open and pay. Lots actually. Don't judge people by one habit. In fact, don't judge people (it is Sunday after all)."

571820,rembrandt100,2008-03-02 23:15:00,3,When you get to Ontario remember that there is NO smoking inside any building unless there is a smoking room vented seperately to the outside. Dave

571861,Rose_Cliff Lake,2008-03-05 19:43:00,116,"Wow, what a bold statement, smokers are slobs. I know I'm not perfect and I've never set a boat on fire, but I do smoke. Yes, I'm working on quitting, trying to cut back, but I'm NO SLOB!!! How dare you make such a bold statement. That's like saying, ""people with green eyes [mine are] are stupid! My 3 cents! Oh yes, I am registered."
571864,Obabikon,2008-03-05 20:35:00,2370,"Go get 'em Rose! Smoking is just like any other bad habbit... it's up to you, until it affects everyone else. If you're a considerate smoker, then you have the right. I won't post on the otherone, but I've met Ed... he's a nice guy. They have a loyal customer base, and that always says something."
571865,Capn Hooker,2008-03-05 22:00:00,333,"I'm a smoker AND I have green eyes. Now I feel really bad. Dejected and rejected. It's bad enough that I have to go out in the freezing cold at least 15 feet away from any wind blockage to have a smoke, but now I have to do it with my eyes closed.

571872,Obabikon,2008-03-06 10:48:00,2370,"How many offensive stereotypes are out there? It's funny that when certain groups are on the bottum of the totem pole, some people find it socially acceptable to use offensive comments. I'm not saying smokers are lower, I'm saying that right now they are having a difficult time, and it's compounded by dumb stereotypical comments. Anyhow... glad you're back on here Rose, I hope things are going great. It feels like a year since St. Louis! Also, off topic, but the Schaumburg IL show I did stunk."
571786,Guest,2008-02-29 21:15:00,0,I think youll find that 99% of the smokers and chewers are a bunch of slobs that dont care where they throw their butts or spit. Ive seen lots of them on the lakes just throw their butts in the lake and keep on fishing. There probably the same ones that are always pissing in the water too. Hope they get tickets. T.G.W.

571800,Guest,2008-03-01 12:59:00,0,I remember when i was a kid the smokers ruled the world and they could/would smoke anywhere and everywhere. well the tide has turned and just this past year out here in nevada the citizens passed the law that anyplace that serves food is a no smoking place.

571802,Guest,2008-03-01 20:53:00,0,Back in the day.... everyone did that. People aren't boneheads really - they just don't think. But my black lab taught me you CAN teach an old dog new tricks and my guests taught me that people can be taught not to throw their butts around

571807,Skyraptor,2008-03-02 08:56:00,291,"Don't feel sorry at all for the smokers who have boat fires, they smoke and then think that it is ok to throw the butt out the window. When I'm following someone who throws a butt of the window at night I make sure that I flash my lights and honk my horn to let them know that I saw it. Once I even saw a cop pull a person over after he saw them throw a butt out. Would like to see the fine a lot higher for littering and yes it is littering and examples need to be made. But the tide is turning and soon smoking will be banned in all public areas. I once saw a women dump a whole bunch of butts in a parking lot and leave her car to shop, picked them up and dumped them back into her open window with a note that I picked up her litter."
571809,Guest,2008-03-02 12:07:00,0,"Way to go skyraptor. Too bad she didnt throw out a hot one ,you could have been lucky and caused her a car fire."
571644,Guest,2008-02-25 20:15:00,0,"Hi. I like to look through the post to remember the good times we had going to canada for the last 40 years. I particularly remember a couple trips where when we got close to the border driving down the highway on wonderfully bright sunny days that off in the distance we could see black smoke rising up. with the kids in the back seat we would try to guess what it might be, forest fire, garbage dump or whatever. As it turned out in each case it was a boat. on one occasion it was a fiberglass boat blazing and the next time it was an aluminum boat just about burned down to the trailer. The guess was that a smoker had thrown out their cigarette butt still lit and the draft pulled it into the boat where with the right unluck and the 60mph breeze it erupted into a real disaster. Its probably something people dont think about to much. As a kid I remember my father smoked and we pulled and aluminim boat to canada many times. I am thinking we were very lucky. I am just curious about people that haul smokers to canada with a boat in tow. what do you do to make sure this does not happen to you and your boat?"
571645,Obabikon,2008-02-25 20:33:00,2370,"That's why there are ash trays in cars. Honestly, it should be criminal for smokers to throw a lit cig from their car! That's how a lot of forest fires start. Just smash it out, and then throw it out."
571647,Guest,2008-02-25 21:56:00,0,OK I'm not trying to start a battle but I spend time every week picking up cigarette butts around our cabins. What is wrong with leaving the butt in the ashtray? Does it need to be butted out and then thrown on the side of the road? As a college student I had a job cleaning up roadsides so MY answer is a resounding NO!!!. I did just quit but I smoked for 41 years (and wish I still could) but I did not throw my butts around for others to pick up. Nor do guests need to throw cig butts or peanut/pistachio shells on the ground around the cabins. These items will not disappear of their own accord (biodegradability is highly overrated). Our guests know that throwing these items on the ground will result in them getting picked on big time by the rest of their group (99+% of people are totally happy to follow the rules if they know them). Pails on the decks for butts and shells do wonders!
571648,Kilroy,2008-02-26 05:34:00,59,"Nobody smokes in my rig, if they have to have one that bad they get one when we stop. I always offer a little Copenhagen, but normally there are no takers. :-) Kilroy"
571649,Obabikon,2008-02-26 06:21:00,2370,"You're right, it's littering. I'm definately for people keeping them in the ashtrays. However, if they're going to throw it out, make sure it's not lit."
571652,Guest,2008-02-26 09:04:00,0,"if you ever had to crawl on your hands and knees policing up the grounds around the barracks, you would quickly learn to field strip your smokes and put the filters in your pockets. but, alas, those days are probably over and gone. i was born and raised in the midwest, left for 20 years and returned. i never saw such littering in my lifetime. you never saw this kind of crap out east, except for maybe the inner cities."
571662,Bill Krejca,2008-02-26 11:57:00,6107,"Back when some of my friends smoked in the car on the way up north, I started carrying a small coffee can with sand in it. Guys were used to just flipping the butt out the window, and not used to having a boat behind them, nor miles of dry pines along the road. This worked very well."
571677,Guest,2008-02-26 19:32:00,0,"I was following a car pulling 2 boats ( a 14' upside down on a 16') enroute to Canada in Northern Wisconsin about 3:00 am. Suddenly we saw flames lapping out from between the 2 boats! We got them to pull over and I extinguished the fire with my new $60.00 Halon extinguisher.( They had none ). All of their luggage plus 2 small outboards were burnt to a crisp. The paint was burnt off 2 metal gas tanks, but they never blew up. We quietly left as the four guys were arguing as to who threw the butt out of the window. My buddy said I should have asked for reimbursment for my extinguisher but I thought those guys had a bad enoungh day, including a fishing trip ruined before it hardly got started. Never throw butts out of the window! Best Fishes! = ggg2"
571736,dutchboy,2008-02-27 20:00:00,5717,"Nobody smokes in my rigs. If you chew you best swallow, no disgusting ""spit"" cups in my rigs either. And never will anybody spit out the window while going 65+ mph down the road."

All other places I field strip the butt and put it in my pocket for disposal later. If you're towing a boat and flip a butt out the window it WILL go in the boat.
