571748,Da Beak,2008-02-28 12:18:00,140,"Now, can you name the band playing >the music? Yup, Audioslave.:rock-on:"

571756,Guest,2008-02-28 17:02:00,0,Amazing. Thanks for sharing. I would like to see these guys sign a stat dec that there will no rescue. Putting our resources and rescue people at risk for this behavior is not cool. That aside I'm in awe.

It does resemble the entrace, but looking closely, I don't believe it is. I'm honestly not sure where it is. The rocks are laying very differently. Anyhow, very cool video!"
571774,Guest,2008-02-29 13:03:00,0,Yep. I watched it a couple of times. its hard to believe they are not some kind of boats with skis on the front to make it look like a sled. yes awsome!

571893,ScottL,2008-03-07 10:33:00,733,"I've witnessed it done on snowmobiling trips, I've even done it myself in flooded farm fields after a fresh snow where I know the water is only 2 or 3 feet deep. But that is just plain unbelievable. Very dangerous to say the least, but I will add that most snowmobilers that go down in open water, go down because they panic and slow down instead of maintain speed or accelerate. Regards, Scott Lee Since there is six times as much water as dry land on earth, any foolcan plainly see the good Lord meant for man to fish six times as much as he works."
571904,Guest,2008-03-07 13:35:00,0,I think most here would be surprised a how easy it is to water skip I would bet that the tracks on those sleds are powder (deep paddle) tracks You would be shocked at how much gas you'll burn doing that
