571787,Guest,2008-02-29 21:31:00,0,"La Place Rendez-Vous in FF. Right on the water, great breakfast in the morning, decent parking for your rig."
571812,MoWalleyeguy,2008-03-02 17:36:00,409,Days Inn or Super 8... and eat at the Chocolate Moose for ANY meal!!!...right next door.
571591,Guest,2008-02-22 15:27:00,0,"I know this subject has been touched on many times but.... what motels would you recommend overnighting at in one of these two towns? Thanks, ahead... Jimi R."
571592,dirt,2008-02-22 15:52:00,144,"I´ve stayed on both sides of the border. I recommend crossing over to Ft Francis the night before. Saves you waiting in line in the morning (and the line can be long). This year we are staying at the La Place Rendez-Vous in Ft. Frances, haven´t been there before but it got good reviews. We´ve never had problems either place with people messing with our boats but you never know. Whatever you choose BOOK NOW or soon. They fill up fast, we usually get our rooms in January. Hope this helps."
571593,Guest,2008-02-22 16:00:00,0,"We have doen both. Use to cross over but now stay in I-Falls at the holiday inn and we love. Got a pool, a bar and resteraunt right there. What more could you ask for. they also have alot of space and we pull our trucls up and grill out the first night and hammer beers and then go into the bar and knock back some more and then when I was younger we would hit the roadhouse until 2am and then stagger back and then up at 5am for border cross."
571594,Jimmy Jig,2008-02-22 17:31:00,1905,Days Inn in I.F. with a very good eating place right next door.
571614,Guest,2008-02-23 12:45:00,0,we have stayed at the holiday inn and la place redevoux many times. like somone said you cant go wrong either place. It might cost a little more than the lower priced places but then you get what you pay for.
571621,bpetersen,2008-02-24 10:51:00,251,If you want all the frills Holiday Inn is the place. If money is a factor. A cheap and clean motel is the Northern Lights Motel. They do give a discount coupon to cross the brigde. Depending on what time of the year you go to Canada. The lines are long in June at the bridge but not in July/August.
571654,Guest,2008-02-26 09:48:00,0,"We have stayed at the Super 8 in FF for years now. Why not cross the border to avoid the hassel in the morning? The Super 8 has a pool, hot tub, clean comfortable reasonably priced rooms, and several places to eat nearby. Call ahead now!!!!"
571656,dave10,2008-02-26 10:10:00,342,"Our vote is La Place Rendez-vouz. That way you're already across the border if you're looking to get an early start, and you can pick up a license just a short drive down the street. Parking lot is well lit and seems pretty secure. Dave"
571661,Guest,2008-02-26 11:38:00,0,"I think that I mentioned this in another thread, but we spend the night at Island view resort on Rainy river.It is less than 15 minutes east of I Falls and is right on the water, adequate,clean rooms,a nice lttle saloon with a view of the water and a very good restaraunt with a view of the water.It is fun to talk the fisherman staying there, and we have picked up info that has and will be useful on future excursions. When I pull out of my driveway I am on vacation.I have found it much more enjoyable to take the trip up in sections and not feel like I need to be in hurry to get to our final destination."
571721,Guest,2008-02-27 11:04:00,0,"Rendezvous and the Super 8 are your best bets in Fort Frances. The Rendezvous is on the east end of Fort right on Rainy Lake and the Super 8 is more towards the west end near a Tim Horton's coffee shop, Canadian Tire, and WalMart. If you want something a little further away, try the Emo Inn in Emo, ON, just 25 minutes west of Fort Frances. -Davis Viehbeck"
