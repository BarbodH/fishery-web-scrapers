We want to provide guests with access to some of the most prolific fisheries & wildernesses Ontario has to offer and do so in a service oriented, friendly environment. While I realize we are not perfect, we do have countless guests send us heartfelt letters for support and appreciation for our efforts. Many say we have helped them achieve some of their most memorable and joyful fishing experiences in many years of traveling to Canada.The part I wrestle with the most is that I know we will fall short of expectations for someone in the future. It's the nature of being in this business as any outfitter will tell you. However, what helps keep our chin up is the fact that the vast majority of our guests truly enjoy themselves while staying at Pasha Lake Cabins, and they do appreciate our service efforts.

1593634,Tinyfish,2013-03-24 17:37:00,16,"Last July was my first trip to Pasha Lake and me and my brother in law had a great trip. Chad took care of us. So, if anyone is looking for great fishing and goods hosts I would recommend Pasha Lake. My brother law and I are counting down the days till our next trip to Pasha Lake which is this June... can't wait. My fingers are sore from tying crawler harnesses to help pass the time."

1550820,lakerbreaker,2013-03-12 20:08:00,253,Just don't go in the winter...Had my worst Canadian experience ever at that place....
1551225,polaris-pete,2013-03-13 13:16:00,343,What was the experience you encountered up there?
1551227,lakerbreaker,2013-03-13 13:22:00,253,"It's a verrrrryyyyy lonnnngggg story and it gets me fired up just thinking about so lets just say, I wont go back and wouldn't ever recommend it to anyone in the winter...."
1551269,polaris-pete,2013-03-13 14:25:00,343,"I went back and found the thread on your trip. I am sorry you had such a bad experience with Chad.Especially since you had your daughter with you.I went up to Pasha 3 Years ago and had a great trip. Granted Chad's place is not a 5 Star Lodge with all the ammenities but considering where he is located and the terrain he operates in, I thought he did a pretty good job.His prices were more than fair and had decent boats and motors.We did have a problem with a boat and motor and he readily fixed the problem for us.He has only had this place for a couple years before I went up. He bought it in a condition which warranted alot of work to get it back in shape.This area you just don't run down to the local Home Depot or Lowes to get what you need! He only had one other fella there helping him when we were there and I never saw him go into his house. He was up well before dawn every morning working and was still in the boat shop well after 9 each nite. Yes he has had a lot of TV Fishing personalities up there to fish and to be honest, hope this helps him out in the future. One thing I will say, is he will never get rich doing this, as he has a growing Family and everything he makes I am sure he puts right back into the business. He also like many other Lodge owners I know, do not close up and fly out to their Winter homes in Florida, Arizona and in 1 case Hawaii. He moves the Family back to Wisconsin or Minnesota.I also will say he had all his Customers safety at mind as everyday before we left, he would ask us what Lake we were going to and if we planned on staying until after dark. he did go out at dark one nite to find a small group who got lost and got them home. I would like to and may very well go back up in the future and hopefully things will have gotten alittle better up there. One last thought, I too am a Business owner and know that a lot of hard work it takes to be sucessful and have been to a few other Lodges where worst things have happened. Good luck and good fishing to you."
1551281,lakerbreaker,2013-03-13 14:49:00,253,"That wasn't my trip you are talking about...Mine involved no heat, no water, broken windows in the cabin, no use of the lodge on and on and on...Basically long story short, he was catering to local miners and tried to boot us for our trip...Wish we would have taken his advice and stayed away..tough to do when you have been planning it for a year....I see you find lots of excuses for him but the bottom line was he was sacrificing us for a local mining crew even though we had planned it for months...Wont ever be back and I tell everybody that I know about my experience..."
1551364,polaris-pete,2013-03-13 17:14:00,343,I don't find any excuses for anyone.Just telling you what my experience was like.I am sure not everyone has a great trip everytime and everywhere you go but in my experience this time I did.Yes I would go back.

""Hmmmm this looks like making excuses to me....I liked Chad personally and would never knock anyone for trying to make a living doing what he is doing...It would be awesome...My problem is with him chosing to ruin our trip due to a local mining crew wanting our pre reserved spot...Our trip meant nothing to him compared to the money he was making off the local miners...."
1584226,Canuck_in_NC,2013-03-21 18:26:00,17,"My wife and I went up it was supposed to be for 2 days but we left after a few hours. Nice family but he has too much to do for all the cabins, we waited around for about a hour in our cabin because he was not there and then went and saw his wife again - she sent us out on a boat on the lake at camp and told us where they caught pike on it [we were there for walleye - the lake it is on has no walleye], anyway it was a little windy and the lake is shallow so I told my wife that when we get a good spot we would throw the anchor, well there was no anchor, paddles, life jackets etc, so we went back to camp. That was the highlight. Nice family, just too many people for one guy where everyone has to drive to different lakes."
