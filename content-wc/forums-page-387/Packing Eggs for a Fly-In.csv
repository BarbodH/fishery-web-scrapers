1601129,5thsuit,2013-03-26 10:57:00,54,"Several years ago our trailer door opened 30 miles south of Dryden, 5 doz eggs in cartons wrapped in a paper bag and one rod case left the trailer at 60mph, luckily for us we stopped for a pee break 10 miles later, noticed the door was open and drove back to look for the rod case. 3 dozen eggs survived the fall, we never did find the rod case and the 3 rods it held."
1587882,Pooch,2013-03-22 18:54:00,4619,"The cartons eggs are sold in are still the best way we have found to keep them safe. Otherwise why would eggs be packed in them in the first place?The cardboard egg cartons are best, but need to be kept dry. We keep the eggs packed with a plastic grocery bag around them to keep melting ice from softening the cardboard cartons.We put them in a hard cooler on top of the cold stuff with bagged lettuce packed around them and as long as no one beats up or dumps the cooler they have always survived. Crushing and impact are egg killers. Otherwise they are fairly resilient.Pooch"
1588426,Terwalleye,2013-03-23 00:34:00,166,"I go to an area Wholesole grocery and restraunt place called Gorden Food Supply. They carry ""scrambled egg mix"" in cartons. Eggs scrambled with some milk. I buy em frozen. About 2 dozen per carton. Works great for breakfast or for fish batter."
1588498,kona7,2013-03-23 03:33:00,6,Our group also freezes them ahead of time. I just prepare them like I would for normal scrambled eggs and then freeze them in quart freezer bags. Can get 10-12 eggs per bag.. Our breakfast meals then consist of alternating between scrambled eggs with ham/bacon or pancakes.
1589066,Pikeslayer8,2013-03-23 08:56:00,1460,"I just get an egg shipping box from my grocer before I go. These boxes are designed and built to protect eggs in transit. Designed to hold 12 dozen eggs, I just fill in the top cavity with produce. Back in the day when our outfitter supplied our foodstuffs, there was a trip when they forgot to pack in eggs for us. This was when we were accustomed to eating eggs every morning and we didn't have a whole lot of alternative options. Well, my dad knew that the outfitter was bringing in a overflow flight this particular day, so he wrote this message on a box and we left it on our dock. We really didn't expect much to come from this as we were 220 air miles from base, but when we got back to camp that night, there were several dozen eggs in our fridge. I believe that the pilot flew to various camps in the area on a egg hunt. My dad has passed on but I still treasure this ole box. Happy Easter everyone!"

1594929,Mike Borger,2013-03-25 03:27:00,1554,"Rick, last year on our 11 day Sutton river canoe trip Bill brought two dozen eggs cracked open in 2 separate nalgene bottles. He didn't freeze them and they were fine for the entire trip, and this was with zero refrigeration. The trick according to him was to buy the egs fresh from a local farmer rather than the grocery store. They didn't spoil."
1595642,MrSimon,2013-03-25 08:14:00,922,"This is an excellent point. We have chickens and eat fresh eggs all the time. Fresh eggs do not need to be refrigerated and will stay good for up to two weeks just sitting on the counter. Once you refrigerate them though, you have to keep them that way. Did you know that the eggs you get in the grocery store are usually at least a week old already? Go buy fresh eggs from a local farm!! They taste better and are better for you. Better yet, get some chickens!!"
1596114,tooski,2013-03-25 09:51:00,393,Exactly as Simon says. Eggs will keep at least two weeks in natures state. Factory (store bought) eggs must be refrigerated as they power blast them with very hot water to get them pearly white for the mass consumer. This washes off natures coating and they must be refrigerated. Can't speak for cracking them and keeping without refrigeration.
1597586,RickOnt,2013-03-25 15:24:00,217,I can get Fresh eggs locally But they are refrigerated when I pick them up.We will have a cooler on our travel and a Fridge at camp.So I am going to try the eggs cracked in a Plastic bottle Like a wide mouth Nalgene and see how that works.ThanksRick
1600969,octanehi5,2013-03-26 10:28:00,1104,"You can not beat the contaner they come in, you just need to pack them so they do not move around much.Nothing better than fresh eggs on a fly in, we always bring 6 doz and have never had a problem."
1585610,RickOnt,2013-03-22 07:03:00,217,I know there are substitutes But there's nothing like Bacon and Eggs and morning coffee as the mist is rising off the Lake. How do you pack your eggs to ensure they make the trip in one piece?ThanksRick
1585658,MrSimon,2013-03-22 07:14:00,922,Crack them all into a plastic bottle. Freeze it. Pack it in the cooler.
1585746,revitup,2013-03-22 07:37:00,140,"Is there a freezer life to this? Do you need to do this just before you leave, or can it be done a few days ahead?"

1585986,Seanik,2013-03-22 08:36:00,218,"Rickont, After several fly ins and long train trips to remote fishing area's, the egg packing solution for us was to use the foam cartons the eggs came with and pack them securely in a thick foam cooler, use ice packs and fill in any voids with packing peanuts. I can remember only 2 cracked eggs out of 8 doz. we usually take in all the many trips we did. Seanik"
1586826,dollure,2013-03-22 12:26:00,71,Fly in chickens. You will have fresh meat also. dollure
1586890,tooski,2013-03-22 12:48:00,393,Well you won't be able to have both Doll.
1586978,NathanH,2013-03-22 13:20:00,697,I have also heard of using muffin tins and just cracking the number of eggs you use per serving in to each tin freeze then pop them out and place them in a freezer bag for the trip and take out as needed.
1587290,RickOnt,2013-03-22 15:02:00,217,I never thought about freezing themGlad I asked.Rick
1587370,tooski,2013-03-22 15:38:00,393,"Rick, Take Seaniks advice. If you freeze them they are only good for breading fish. No over easy, no poached eggs, etc. To me you might as well take powdered. I do the same as Seanik only pack them with towels and bedding stuff in lieu of the packing peanuts. Haven't lost an egg in over 50 trips. They are going to take up about the same space if they are in a carton or a baggie."
