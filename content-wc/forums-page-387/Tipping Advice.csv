1430121,Crede,2012-05-03 08:20:00,134,"I like it when a lodge tells me what the recommended tip % is. I like it even more if they post it on their website. Many times in the past we have stood around the last evening trying to figure out a tip having literally no clue if we were being overly generous or cheap. If the suggestion is on the lodge website we at least know about how much to budget per person. How the service goes that week will determine how much we actually end up tipping, but we have the $ with us and have some sense if we are high, low, or average."

1603281,andreej,2013-03-26 19:33:00,248,"I find it interesting how we tip certain people and never tip others who do similar work. when was the last time you tipped your flight attendant? Serving drinks and snacks to 50 people on a regional jet by yourself on a 45 minute flight (not to mention doing their primary job of saving your a$$ if there is an emergency) is a heck of a lot of work. What about the pilots? I've been an airline pilot for 15 years and never heard of a pilot getting a tip!! Not that I am expecting one, but why is it automatic that the pilot on a fly-in trip gets a healthy tip?"
1603377,Glenman12,2013-03-26 19:57:00,762,we give the cook $20 per man (8 guys) and $20 per man for the dock help which is a husband and wife..
1604225,LLewellin,2013-03-27 06:05:00,1790,Let me see......... how to get tipping started in my line of work........ not sure but would love a 10-15% bonus every time I do my job..... just saying.
1429070,nd89sc88,2012-05-01 06:14:00,92,"This is an interesting discussion, and something I've never really had to think about before. Until this year, I've always gone with my dad to the same very small owner run resort that was rustic housekeeping. As a result, we do most everything for ourselves, and really only interact with the owners/operators every other day or so for boat gas, so we've never tipped. However, this year, I'm heading to Lost Island Lodge with a buddy, and though we're doing it housekeeping there, I expect we will have more interaction with staff related to our rental boat, bait, etc. Sounds to me like I should budget in something to tip the dock boys. Apart from the amount, is it customary to tip the individual workers, or add a tip at the end which the owner will distribute? Since we aren't in the dining room, how would this work? I don't want to look like an a$$, and I have no problem tipping for service, but the mechanics of the issue aren't something I've really encountered before. Also, should we tip at the beginning to ""encourage"" great service, and then again at the end, or just at the end. Thanks for any advice, Bill"
1429161,Outfitter17,2012-05-01 09:08:00,127,Well put Fisherman Ted.
1429279,MidWestFishman,2012-05-01 13:01:00,44,"This is an interesting thread. In 1998 I was at a lodge fishing with my Dad and we were very satisfied and left about about 10% between the two of us of the total bill. I can still remember the folks there thanking us as well as talking about one husband wife who left 0% tip! I remember the staff was very disappointed about those folks. We actually had no idea what was appropriate so I hoped we were close to the mark. Fast forward to 2005. My Dad could not go so a business associate went with me. This was a top end lodge that I saved for all year and they had a booking agent working for them. I asked the agent about tipping so I could get it right and he said $100 each would be fine. I thought that was a bit low so brought $250 for the tip and told my fishing buddy to do the same. The night before we were to leave from our week of fishing, I picked up a notebook that had been lying around the cabin. I was stunned when it said the tip should be 15% each which put each of us at about $525 for a tip. Neither of us had that kind of extra money and went to the lodge owner. We explained what his booking agent in their office told us and that we were only at about 1/2 of what was expected and he could explain to the guide and others why the tip was short and suggested he train his agent better. I was personally embarrassed about it.I have been to Fisherman Teds lodge and can tell you that his staff work very hard as he said and 10% is certainly appropriate there for the service you receive. I don't want to sound like an ad for them but Ted personally went after an item that meant a great deal to me that I left at one of the portage lakes. I know between the boat ride and the long walk to that lake and back that it took him about 90 minutes of his time to retrieve it for me. Great service? You bet and worth the tip!"
1429642,ohiojmj,2012-05-02 08:56:00,1262,"I've never been to the upscale lodges for the rich. When I go to a basic cabin and bring my own gas, bait, food, dock line, hold my own rod, find my own fish, etc., I tip based on the housekcleaning of the cabin. Most are pristine clean so I leave $20 or so for that service. Any extra or extraordinary service, I tip further. A dude drives to town for a prop or fixes my boat, the tip would go up considerably."
1429910,jigstop,2012-05-02 18:57:00,631,"A lot of people work hard in the service industry without getting tipped. Do you tip your plumber or electrician 10-15%? I doubt it. Now people will say that the people at these lodges aren't the owners so they should get tipped. Well in most cases neither are the plumbers or electricians. They will say that waiters get tips but do the people at these lodges make $2.50 an hour or do they get paid more? Of course lodge owners want guests to tip because that means that they don't have to pay their workers a decent wage. If the worker thinks they are worth more they should go to the owner and ask for a raise, not rely on handouts from the guests.If the lodge had a notebook with a recomended tip % I would find that in very poor taste."
1429947,Pikeslayer8,2012-05-02 20:10:00,1460,My plumber and electrician do not hold the keys to what most of us consider our personal slice of heaven on earth. I'm not disparaging your opinion but I think that you are rationalizing being a cheapskate.
1429961,jigstop,2012-05-02 20:26:00,631,"I don't think I'm a cheapskate, in fact I get stuck into the tipping thing with guides and resorts and tip way more than I should IMHO. I'm just sick of the tipping thing getting out of hand with these people, if they want more money or need more money to pay their employees then charge more instead of begging for it."
1429980,Pikeslayer8,2012-05-02 20:59:00,1460,"Jigstop, Maybe I've got you wrong. I speak only for myself as I do the fly-in outpost thing. Other than the pilots who we have known for many years of which do not own the planes that they operate and the dockboy, that is our only opportunity to express our gratitude in a modest monetary tip. I have never ever felt it to be expected or anticipated. I think that's because of the classy outfitter we use. I don't know where you like to go, but I hope you are happy there. Have a great fishing summer."
1429989,Fisherman Ted,2012-05-02 21:38:00,461,"Jigstop, you would be surprised to know that due to many factors, especially the economy that many resorts have a difficult time paying exorbitant salaries. Heck, you don't get rich owning a lodge either. These hard working men and women do this as a life-style (many of them anyway). They love the out-doors and are able to work in a place that is as close to heaven as you can get (I hope others on this board would agree). They can fish in the evenings or days off for example which for a guide is as good as gold. In return the salary (which includes room and board in many cases) is not what you would think. But for many that's fine with all of the wonderful benefits that come with it. The same could be said for many owners too, although I would never speak for others. A tip is a thank you for excellent work, above and beyond your expectations. Its a thank you to a staff that looks out for your every need and ensures that the one trip you have to Canada (or wherever) each year is everything you hoped it would be, and then some. Not everyone tips, some do more some less. Some not at all. No one should ever feel they have to. I simply said when asked by a guest that is what I recommended. It is not written anywhere, nor would I ever say anything to a guest who did not tip at all. I am happy they are my guest. Money does not make me like them more. Heck, they could come for free (and I have comped trips plenty of times to those down on their luck, life's rough) and they would be as important as the guest that flies their own Cessna. We don't expect tips nor anticipate them. Never will. But you are correct. When I start paying my employees $80 an hour (which is what a good electrician costs) then tipping is probably out of the question. When that happens I will of course be bankrupt and that wonderful trip few men ever have a chance to experience will simply disappear.Fisherman Ted"
1429994,v-bay gord,2012-05-02 22:16:00,3168,"Darkness is cheap, and Scrooge liked it. Tipping should not leave you feeling bitter and coerced (like Scrooge). Not everyone tips, and that's o.k. Try and make your next tipping experience a good one!"
1218114,Pooch,2010-07-11 19:08:00,4619,"For a one week house keeping plan where the only support is fueling the boat and giving us a few minnows every morning we have been tipping at $20 per person a week. That's a $80 tip for four of us using two camp boats. We clean the cabin when we leave.Wife and I just got home from nine days in the same camp and we left $50 for the folks on the dock. Is this a little ""light""?A couple years ago we had one new chump on the trip and he threw in one dollar. I made up the difference and wouldn't let him ever go with us again for any amount of money.Informative thread. I'd like to hear from some of the camp owners who frequent this board. What do you owners think? Give us some more ideas as to what's fair.Pooch"
1218151,Obabikon,2010-07-11 21:48:00,2370,A pilot is not at all what I was talking about. The original question was asked about American Plan resorts... where FIVE or SIX people would be splitting the tip. Those are for the guys that help you your entire trip. I have no clue what's appropriate for a pilot to be tipped.
1218155,Obabikon,2010-07-11 21:58:00,2370,"Everyone tips differently. You need to know how many people you are tipping for. With my employees, there are five people that split the tips. Also, the average trip to our resort does not run $1500. But, when you go to an expensive restraunt you still tip 15%, right? A group six could easily leave $75 per person, and that'd be a VERY good tip for our resort (that's 5%). Once it's split up, that's really just tipping each person $15 for the trip. All that said, make them earn it. Don't leave a tip just to leave a tip. If there's a reason you cut the tip out, or lowered it... tell the camp owner. I've been informed before that some type of service wasn't taken care of and that's why the tip was lowered/didn't happen. That makes it easy to go to a staff and say ""we need to do a better job"". A tip is given to reward good service and ensure good service in the future."
1218768,Northpoint,2010-07-13 18:18:00,38,I believe that we tipped the cook $5 per day per person and the food service staff about the same. The guide we generally tipped $100 per day with a small added bonus for evening fishing........sometimes a bit more if the fishing was exceptional or the weather made their work harder. The guide got a $200 bonus for any fish that qualified for a master angler award. Generally we found that the guides took excellent care of my wife and I and this was well worth the expense.
1428521,IaDave,2012-04-30 09:07:00,476,Do most guests put it on the final bill or hand cash to each individual at the end of the week?
1428550,camp chef,2012-04-30 09:47:00,915,"When ever at a new camp be it hunting or fishing, I got in the habit of tipping the the people that I felt could impact the quality of my experience at the beginning of the week as opposed to when I left.I always had good service and sometimes access that I may not have had."
1428817,new hips,2012-04-30 17:09:00,498,"Last year, 5 guys, $100 to pilot flying in. $100 flying out, he said it would be split between 2 dock hands, owner flew the plane. Another trip, husband and wife were caretakers, she did all the cooking, on a remote fly in, I tipped $200 for the week. Depends on how much they do for you, I tip accordingly. If the boats are gassed and pumped out, I give them more."
1428918,jigstop,2012-04-30 19:45:00,631,"I would never tip a pilot. He owns the plane and sets the price. If he thinks he's worth more. which he might well be, then he should charge more.For some reason tipping has gotten out of hand at resorts and for guides. If a guide wants more then he should charge more. If a dock boy thinks he's worth more then ask for a raise, if he doesn't get the raise and the resort hires someone else for his old wage I guess he wasn't worth what he though he was."
1428976,v-bay gord,2012-04-30 21:10:00,3168,"Reminds me of the movie ""A Christmas Carol"" when Scrooge makes some comment like ""Are there no prisons, are there no work houses?"""
1429023,Fisherman Ted,2012-04-30 23:04:00,461,"As an owner, when guests ask me I too recommend 10% of the trip cost. As stated earlier when you go to a restaurant most people tip at least 15%, if not more for good service.A full American Plan lodge has far more service and demands than a waiter ever will. From cleaning boats, to cleaning cabins, parking your car, readying your boat, waiting tables, carrying luggage, fishing lessons, running snacks down to the cabins, ensuring you have your favorite beverage at happy hour etc. These staff work very long hours, and cater to guests easily 18 hours a day to ensure you have the best possible trip.Of course they need to earn it. To answer another question, tips at our resort are always given at the end when settling the bill as they are then split among all the staff. Tipping has not gotten out of hand at all in my opinion. At an American Plan lodge its all about service. Its a service industry unlike any other. Where-else are you interacting with a dock-hand at 5 AM, guide all day, waitress at lunch and chef at dinner? Without the service customers would never come back. I hold my employees to the highest standards so you the guest will have a memorable trip. Tipping the staff lets them know so.Fisherman Ted"
1217912,NP4ME,2010-07-10 22:03:00,378,"Just wanted some tipping advice from the more seasoned travelers. We have a group of 7 on an American plan at around $1200. I believe there are about 5 or 6 people that work at the camp (dock hands, cook, maid, etc). We don't want to be chincy, but the $1200 trip is a bit of a splurge for the most of us in the group. Please give some tipping suggestions. I have had owners in the past say, ""whatever you think."" It is hard to know if you don't have much of an idea. Thanks for the help!"
1217915,adempsey,2010-07-10 23:21:00,963,"I typically leave $100 for the week, but I think I tip on the high side since I used to work in the service industry when I was younger. So, I think $50 is more than adequate, especially with that many people in your group. The trips are expensive enough and the staff will get paid a fair wage. They aren't getting paid the wages of a waitress, which is lower than minimum wage in Canada due to tipping."
1217932,Hawker,2010-07-11 06:36:00,3967,"The camp we go to has a waitress/maid/dock hand staff of about the same numbers. The rate we pay is only slightly higher (about $1500 per person) and we have gotten to know the owners quite well and they will speak candidly to us when we ask questions in regards to things like tipping etc! For a staff their size, it was suggested that a $100 tip (between my wife & I) was a very adequate tip to leave for a weeks stay. That's what we started leaving a few years ago, but have since doubled that only because we have watched and seen first hand how hard each of the staff members work to ensure our stay there is one to remember each year!"
1217938,gmattbruin,2010-07-11 07:11:00,174,"On fly-in trips does anyone tip their pilots? I guess their job is not only to get you in and out safely,but also check many things before they leave,eg. fuel,propane,etc."
1217942,MorganMan,2010-07-11 07:17:00,341,"We have not tipped the dock hands before as we fly in and we load and unload our own things most of the time. We do tip the pilot each way, but have never thought to tip the dock hands if there is one there to help with the loading. We will need to be more aware in the future."
1217964,Rlcrouse,2010-07-11 08:45:00,286,We tip the pilot $50.00 each way. I think the dock guys get about $25.00 each
1217970,go dart,2010-07-11 09:04:00,77,"I'll never forget when a friend of mine told me they loaded on a bush plane for a week at an outpost. They noticed a plaque that said "" dont forget to tip your pilot "" Well they didn't on the flight in and he was a full day late picking them up."
1217981,MorganMan,2010-07-11 09:33:00,341,"Lol. Our guy has a plaque stating ""Tipping the pilot helps him remember where he left you!"""
1217985,Obabikon,2010-07-11 09:41:00,2370,"As an operator, when guests ask. I suggest between 5 and 10% of the entire bill. So, if they do a good job... tip them on the higher side of that number. If they don't... tip on the lower side."
1217994,MorganMan,2010-07-11 10:16:00,341,"Obabikon, is that the total bill per person? About $1500 bucks a head so the total tip for pilot would be $75 to $150? Not total bill for the group? (group bill for 6 is $9000)"
