1577594,vteye,2013-03-20 12:32:00,812,A group from New England taking the long drive to Nakina. Which route do you take Trans Canada North of Montreal towards Val-D-Or and Kirkland Lake or via North Bay and then North ? We will be driving all one nightso looking for best roads primary and time slightly secondary.
1577826,Mike Borger,2013-03-20 13:40:00,1554,"No brainer. Follow hwy 11 west to 584, then take 584 straight to Nakina. Paved hwy all the way.This topic came up for discussion a couple years ago and multiple people mentioned taking the Blueberry road off hwy 11 as a shortcut to Nakina. A couple of km's before you enter the town of Longlac the Blueberry road heads north to Lower Twin Lakes. It's a gravel road and its shape depends on whether it's been graded. You've then got a 15 minute drive directly west from Lower Twin on another gravel road to reach Nakina.Taking this route cuts off a big triangle and yes does save about 40 minutes of driving. BUT I'll never do it again. I would only recommend this route if you're driving a pick up or a larger SUV. Anything that sits closer to the ground will get pounded by rocks. That's what happened to me driving a month old Toyota Sienna van."
1578130,dog2,2013-03-20 14:55:00,198,From where you are coming from Solo is right.Just top the tanks off at Hearst it's about 140 miles to Longlac no fuel on this stretch of the road after 8pm and it is a long lonely stretch of road. The blue berry road can be rough and quite dusty.
1578282,RickOnt,2013-03-20 15:26:00,217,For the 'Best' roads I would take 40 thru Montreal then catch 17 north thru Ottawa and on to North Bay. From there as Solo said 11 to 584.The drive N of Montreal thru Verendrye might cut off a few miles but driving at night could be a challenge and I dought it would save much time.However it would be a very scenic trip if done during the day.My $.02Rick

It wont be shorter,especially in June,and the damage you will probably do to your vehicle isnt worth it. Geraldton has everything you might need for last minute stuff,or even just to fuel up for the drive to Nakina. One thing we hav noticed over the yrs though is the amount of bears on Hwy584. Used to maybe see 1, our last trip we prob saw 6 at different pts home. great hwy."
