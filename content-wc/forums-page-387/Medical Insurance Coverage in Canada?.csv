1610890,Fisherman Ted,2013-03-28 13:56:00,461,I too have BC/BS and on the rare occasions I need to get services pay up front and get reimbursed after the fact. Never had a problem.
1610994,dkrusin,2013-03-28 14:18:00,97,"They also will not pay more then the ""usual and customary"" charge. This normally not a problem since the United States has the highest medical cost in the World. Also the best."
1611890,polaris-pete,2013-03-28 18:01:00,343,Thanks to all that replied. Good to know before you need it. Will be checking my Policy. Have a great trip wherever you go.
1608057,polaris-pete,2013-03-27 20:50:00,343,"Haven't seen much posted on this subject so thought I would ask.I was told that there is no Medical coverage in Canada unless you get a seperate rider on your policy.I am going to look into this as my friend did not have any insurance this past Winter and needed hospital care after a snowmobile accident.He was taken to a hospital and they would not treat him until he gave them his Visa card to cover any expenses. After putting a cast on his leg and his friends bringing him home, find a bill in the mail 3 months later to the sum of over $9000! He was and still is shocked.He is fighting right now to try and recoup his money but so far its like peeing into the wind he said.Anyone?? I guess after fishing and snowmobiling in Canada for the last 38 years am lucky I have not needed any medical asisstance but as we all get older you never know."
1608113,Golden Eagle,2013-03-27 21:12:00,2642,You probably have coverage anywhere in the world. Maybe give your policy a quick look.
1608145,Jesse-WI,2013-03-27 21:25:00,534,"Do this. Check your policy and/or call and discuss not only what is covered but how it works. I know in my case, unless it is life and death situation I will need to cross back over the border for any costly care."
1608225,bigdaddyguns,2013-03-27 22:18:00,608,"As the other posters have mentioned it goes back to the definitions of coverage and exclusions on your policy. I looked into the medical coverage issue last summer and for my policy it was a pay first, then submit claim and let the insurance company negotiate whatever the covered expenses would be. Again it depends on your policy. The worst position to be in is not having any medical coverage especially outside the US. You are at the total mercy of the medical system which is not very forgiving costwise. At least the insurance companies have some leverage to negotiate down the rates between themselves. Bottom line, get to know you medical coverage before crossing the border."
1608674,Shellback,2013-03-28 06:30:00,8083,Americans are responsible for medical charges in Canada. You have to pay the bill then send it to your American insurer. A Canadian traveling outside their country has to buy a separate policy to cover them. Their medical system doesn't cover them outside of Canada.
1609114,LOW1,2013-03-28 08:11:00,2828,"It all depends on what insurance you have. For example, here's a link to Wellmark BCBS which lists international providers. BCS will pay these providers directly, making the patient only responsible for deductables and copayments..https://www.bluecardworldwide.com/Other insurance companies provide different levels of benefits depending on participation by the provider, etc. As others have said, submit he claim using the proper forms and documentation and read your policy carefully. If the medical care was for an emergency, make especially sure that the emergency is documented."
1609770,Shellback,2013-03-28 10:14:00,8083,"I do have Blue Cross Blue Shield, and was told I was responsible for payment, and then they would reimburse me. Never told me about other providers."
1609906,LOW1,2013-03-28 10:39:00,2828,"There are a number of different BCBS companies so they may not all be the same. But they should be able to give you more info than what they told you.Also, if you know where in Canada you would likely need care, call up the particular hospital and talk to the business office. When I called the Kenora hospital they were quite familiar with the process."
1609978,Fonzie,2013-03-28 10:48:00,85,"FWIW, I have BC/BS and make semi-frequent trips to Ecuador.One time my asthma acted up bad and I had to spend 2 or 3 days in the hospital.I paid all my bills and then submitted my receipts to BC/BS and they reimbursed me for everything, minus a few small deductible type fees. ."
1610874,plumberjoe,2013-03-28 13:48:00,54,I have WPS and was told that I am covered. My Dad is on medicare and is so not he purchaesd a policy for around 50 bucks that gives him major med while were up there for the week. He got the companys name from his travel agent.
