Walleye is our fish of choice, usually have good success trolling at night. Last year we got into some huge crappie trolling hot n tots. Curious to see if anyone else fishes the lake and what tricks work for you?"

I have fished Bob's Lake once, and would like to get back up there and try it some more. This year I'll be up the last 2 weeks of May, as I'm going to have shoulder surgery June 1st. How's the walleye fishing treat you on Bob""s?"
1593602,jcrushford,2013-03-24 17:27:00,32,We always seem to catch enough for a couple of good fish frys before we head back to the states. This year I'm going to do some bottom bouncing with crawlers for the first time.
