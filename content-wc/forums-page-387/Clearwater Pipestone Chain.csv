Definitely worth a look - they have a ton of maps...."
1613721,Admiral Cain,2013-03-29 07:21:00,15,Considering a trip to Little Moose in 2014. We go 1st week of August. Currently fishing in Ignace area. Have fished Ignace area for the past 20 years. Looking for a change. Any feed back would be appreciated.Tight lines to all! Happy Easter!
1316770,Fiskerman,2011-06-10 08:53:00,2,"Hey ManitouBass which is better for the big old smallmouth, Clearwater or downriver lakes? Coming up again in a week. This last trip they were in and out some spawned others not, some topwater others cranks and jerks. Any good crappie spots? Caught some in Despair, 18-20 ft. Where to they come up? I like to cast and cover a lot of water. Love topwater!"
1317069,tyson2925,2011-06-11 07:45:00,95,"Just got back from clearwater, we typically fish pop r's every morning for smallmouth but chased walleye more this yr. Last yr we went in Aug and the top water fishing was awesome. 2 smallies over 20"". Top water is fun through the south portage also, river stretches especially."
1318152,ManitouBass,2011-06-14 08:53:00,201,"I would head to Jackfish. Great pike, bass and walleye fishing.Water is really clear, so natural forage patterns work very well. In some of the smaller, shallower bays, cranking for bass can be absolutely great. The walleye should still be fairly shallow, anywhere from 2-12 ft. Jigs and minnows, crawlers, leeches is your best bet.I've never crappie fished there, so I can't help you out there.Have a great trip, and be careful in the narrows"
1318598,tyson2925,2011-06-15 11:52:00,95,"Just got back from a week at Little Moose Lodge on Clearwater lake near Emo. Fishing was fantastic! Terry and Monica took great care of us. They have very nice boats as well if you are looking for a nice drive to lodge. I fished clearwater mainly. We caught most of our walleye in 20 -30 ft of water on a jig and minnow. Leeches caught fish but the minnow was better and was what most people were having luck with. We probably caught around 150 walleye between 2 in the 15"" range. There were multiple 28"" + walleye caught by people staying at the lodge the same week but unfortunately we did not get a big one. The boat next to us caught a 29"" one evening, it was mixed in with a bunch of eaters. Seems like you have to just fish and hope for a big guy to swim by.Caught three musky while fishing for walleye on clearwater, two on a #7 shad rap trolling and one on a jig and minnow - 36"", 40"", 43"" and one broke off at the boat.In the south lakes I caught a 33"" pike below jackfish rapids. We were able to shoot the rapids with out incident to get up into jackfish. We only had a few hours on jackfish but we fished a weed reef out in the middle of the lake and found alot of nice walleye and pike in 6-8ft of water. My plan next year is to spend more time at Jackfish but I think that Clearwater holds the best trophy potential for walleye and the bonus musky.I would note that the rangers were out in force, they pulled us over on Sunday to check our licenses, I think they are mainly out to make sure people arent targeting Musky out of season. Accidental catch is OK."
1318959,Guest,2011-06-16 08:58:00,0,Thanks guys! Plans changed won't be going up until around the 4th of July. Will be chasing those brown fish and maybe a musky or two. Have a great summer!
1436232,tyson2925,2012-05-16 11:35:00,95,"Heading to Clearwater/Pipestone Chain of Lakes near Emo on June 9th for a week. My main goal is to find some larger Walleyes and was looking for some advice or direction on where to start. We will be staying on Clearwater primarily but will venture to Pipestone atleast one day and will motor South to Jackfish for a day as well. We did a good job last year of catching numbers, mainly jigging, but we are focusing on quality this year.Any input is appreciated. Looking for info on depths, baits, techniques, spots for this time of year. Thanks!"
1436248,camp chef,2012-05-16 12:09:00,915,What we found last year was because of the clarity of the water fishing late in the day is a plus. I would run spinner rigs with large minnows or bobber fish any place water is coming into pipestone.....even if it is just a trickle. By the way the Muskie in the pic ture came off Pipestone last spring while pulling a spinner and minnow on 6 # test and a light rod and reel
1436845,tyson2925,2012-05-17 11:45:00,95,"Nice Musky camp Chef! I appreciate the advice. We actually had our first experience with Musky's last year on Clearwater Lake. Caught 3 of them! I have purchased some spinners with large blades and some heavy bottom bouncers. From the the info I gleamed from other campers and Terry at Little Moose lodge, the larger fish were coming on deep spinners and jigs 25 -35 FOW. I was really hoping that in early june we could find bigger fish shallow but everyone that caught anything over 26"" was in deep water. Maybe later in the evening we will find a shallow movement to where we can cast big swimbaits and cranks. I plan on staying out past dark to find out. I attached a pic of a couple muskies we got last year."
1589642,Further North,2013-03-23 12:40:00,2008,"Due some scheduling issues, we'll be heading to Clearwater/Pipestone the first week of July.Any advice?I saw above where natural forage patterns are good - anything in particular? Perch, walleye fry?Does anyone know if these lakes appear on any map chips that will work on a Humminbird""? I have the Canadian Navionics chip already if that one will work, or if there are any others folks will recommend....We'll be staying at Little Moose Lodge and running an old 18 ft. Pro-V so travel to places a ways away won't be a problem if that is a recommendation."
1591434,fishingfever,2013-03-24 04:43:00,85,I stayed at Little Moose last year. Your camp owner Terry is also a guide and very good fisherman. He will be able to steer you in the right direction and tell you where to fish on Clearwater. For walleyes you may well be better off going south to Despair/Jackfish instead of north to Pipestone. Pipestone will be the place though for musky and lake trout. My Navionics map chip didn't have the Clearwater chain on it and I don't think it's on their list of lake maps this year either. I don't know about other map chip makers. Good luck to you.
1300685,Bill Krejca,2011-04-29 06:36:00,6107,"Re: Schistose - good for lake trout, didn't get any walleyes when there a number of years ago, in late May. Bill"
1313868,tyson2925,2011-06-02 09:53:00,95,"I was just curious if anyone had any reports for the clearwater pipestone chain near emo yet? I am heading that way saturday.Thanks,"
1313943,greg2648,2011-06-02 12:44:00,80,"We fished Pipestone for 18 years. We stayed at Pipestone Lodge (now burned down). We fished Shistose often. Not very good mid-June for walleye. Decent for smallies. Dad caught a 54"" Muskie there one year. Thompson Bay is a good pick. Portage to Straw (walleye on every cast). Short portage to Tommie lake (unbelievable walleye fishing). Jig/minnow and Lindy rigs worked for us. Good Luck."
1313965,ManitouBass,2011-06-02 13:56:00,201,Right on! Maybe you'll get lucky and be fishing with Harvey Cochrane. He's up there guiding right now.You'll have a great trip!
1314060,guide7,2011-06-02 19:30:00,70,"I think the burned down lodge was called Happy Landings, not Pipestone Lodge. We stayed at Pipestone Lodge for ice-out this spring and it was alive and kicking. Art and Jenny and crew do a great job. 7"
1314103,Floater1,2011-06-02 20:57:00,55,"Tyson 2925, if you would like, send me an email to [email protected] and I will give you the lowdown on the Clearwater-Pipestone chain. I owned a cabin there for 15 years!!"
1314220,greg2648,2011-06-03 08:43:00,80,"Guide7 you are right, it was Happy Landing. Owner was Larry Stahn when we went there many years ago. We have also stayed at Pipestone Lodge, nice camp."
1314223,tyson2925,2011-06-03 08:54:00,95,"Good stuff, it would be fun to portage into some of those walleye filled lakes. I have always heard of fly in lakes like that but have never experienced it first hand. We are staying on Clearwater but will talk to Terry at Little moose lodge about our options. thanks."
1314224,tyson2925,2011-06-03 08:54:00,95,I sent you my email address. Thanks in advance!
1316764,Fiskerman,2011-06-10 08:42:00,2,"I think some of ya'all are spoofing me! I just got back from a six day wind blown trip and while there talked to many anglers who were not having much luck catching those 70-100 fish a day!I did well; not a 100 per day, but enough to qualify as a sucessful trip! Caught most casting hard baits. I love fishing this way! The fish were up on the windy banks and hit good.Lots of smallmouth the one day the sun shined. They really wanted to come up but the weather kept chasing them back out."
1296660,tyson2925,2011-04-19 08:16:00,95,"I hear ya, I m not to far behind, please let me know how you do! Good luck."
1297280,gary2242,2011-04-20 12:27:00,49,"I have some advise!!! Fish shallow !!!! It's a very late ice-out and a very cold spring so the walleye and Pike will be in 5-foot of water or less and right up against shore. The lake trout will be everywhere just a few feet under the surface.I fished Little Moose Lodge 2 years ago and the fishing was amazing. We are going back this July. We caught tons of Walleyes and pike and hit a few big Lake Trout right in the shallows while casting for pike. We were there around mid June. The smallmouth and Muskie were just starting but not red hot like the walleye and pike. We talked to some other guys that go there every spring for walleye and then go back in July for Smallmouth and Muskie. They told us they catch swarms of big smallmouth as well as pike and Walleye. They also said late afternoon Muskie fishing is red hot in July. They told me 4:00 pm to 7:30 pm was when they were hitting them.You should take at least 2 of your days, pack a big lunch and take off through the mechanical portages. The scenery is awesome and the fishing is awesome. That was half the trip.Gary"
1297283,camp chef,2011-04-20 12:40:00,915,Thank you for the advise. Our camp is on Pipestone We were told that once you get back into Pipestone ( We are 10 miles from the portage) that there is no need to head back towards civilization.Apparently fishing is better the farther away you get. We will know more in a month.
1297297,Outfitter17,2011-04-20 12:56:00,127,"Camp Chef is right, the farther north you get up pipestone the better. The farther away you get from all the traffic on clearwater and the bottom of pipestone, the better off you will be fishing and fishing spot wise. There are a ton of good spots to fish on the north end of pipestone that rarely get fished, due to the limited traffic. That's why people like to do fly ins or remote boat ins, because there is very little fishing pressure compared to drive to camps."
1297298,tyson2925,2011-04-20 12:57:00,95,"Gary,Thanks for the info and the anticipation build up. Fishing shallow and the shot at a bigger walleye was the main reason for our early june trip. We went in Mid August and caught lots of eater walleye in the evening, 22"" was our best. We caught some huge smallmouth in the morning everyday, two of which are being replicated now. We didnt catch the smallmouth every cast like some lakes i have been to but but when we got them they were 19""+. any suggestions on lures, presentations you have had success with, etc."
1297305,tyson2925,2011-04-20 13:09:00,95,"Camp Chef and Outfitter, have you ever made it up to Schistose lake N of pipestone. I have heard that it can be really good if you are willing to make the trip. Definetly would be remote I think.thanks again."
1297319,camp chef,2011-04-20 13:35:00,915,This will be my first trip to this body of water. I have amarked up map that has spots on Schistose. We are planiing to spend some time there
1297376,Outfitter17,2011-04-20 15:49:00,127,"Tyson,I fished schistose alot from 2001 to 2008. It has really good bass fishing right between pipestone and schistose in the narrows especially in early june if you hit it right. You will also find great smally fishing if you go all the way to the west end and fish the shallows, with the water being clear you can site fish the water under 7' deep. With that being said about the smallies, I would skip it for walleyes - they don't really get good in schitose until they hit the reefs in late june - early july.For walleyes I would fish back bay and thompson bay, mainly the north side of each bay."
1297823,Further North,2011-04-21 19:50:00,2008,"Interesting thinking...we are going to be quite a ways north of there (Sturgeon Lake, about an hour north of Ignace) in mid June (a week or so later).Do you think the same strategy will apply?"
1300599,Further North,2011-04-28 20:35:00,2008,Bump....
1294741,tyson2925,2011-04-14 13:54:00,95,I am heading up to Little Moose Lodge on Clearwater Lake the first week in June. We had excellent fishing for smallmouth and walleye last year in August but were advised that early June is a great time to go. Has anyone fished these lakes at this time of year? Any suggestions as to the best ways to target larger walleye this time of year. Thanks!
1294745,rickn,2011-04-14 14:04:00,993,are you talking clearwater by emo?
1295077,tyson2925,2011-04-15 10:41:00,95,"Yes, by Emo, thanks!"
1295083,ManitouBass,2011-04-15 10:52:00,201,"Yep, I've fished there alot at that time of the year. You'll catch alot of walleye, most will be 15-20"", but you can pull some in the larger range. The action is high, pretty easy to pull 70-100 fish on any given day.Minnow and jig always work great, either vert. jigging or a cast/jig retrieve to locate active fish. We usually slow troll to locate fish then either drift or anchor.Gulp minnows or Trigger X baits work good as well, and helps you spend more time fishing, rather than rigging minnows all day long. The normal minnow patterns work best, the clarity of the water is really good so natural looking baits will work best.You'll have to tinker around with depth a little this time of year, we find them anywhere between 10-22ft. Look for drop off points close to shore to start off.Towards the end of the day, throw on a spinner bait and take a few casts for pike, lots in the 40"" range and there fun as all **** to catch.Good luck, and have a great trip!"
1295096,rickn,2011-04-15 11:27:00,993,"we have been going there the last week in june for years. haven't found the big numbers, but have gotten 2 pbs from there, a 31, and a just barley 32. lots of 25-28 inchers, too."
1295160,tyson2925,2011-04-15 13:54:00,95,"Manitou Bass - Thanks for the reports, youve got me excited to get up there. part of the reason for the earlier trip is to hopefully find larger fish a little shallower, being from Kansas our walleye like to sit on fairly shallow mud flats, jigging in 30 ft is not my specialty. Love to catch them casting to shore, trolling, and in bays if you think that is a good possibility? Do you look for weeds, hard bottom, points, wind? Any other tips would be great!RickN - how did you catch those big ones, any details are much appreciated! Thanks again!"
1295173,rickn,2011-04-15 14:14:00,993,bouncers and crawlers
1295188,ManitouBass,2011-04-15 15:06:00,201,"We usually get close to islands and not too far off shore. If it's windy, fish the windswept side.Your plans sound good, all those techniques will work. Just use your instincs to guide you and don't be afraid to try different approaches throughout your trip. Look for changes in the water, drop offs, changes in bottom structure, like rock to sand, pebble to rock. Weedlines as well. Just your basic stuff really.Sometimes the larger walleyes will be suspended in deeper waters, but I don't fish the deeper water as much, just too hard on the fish to bring them up 80-90 ft. Plus it's not as exciting to fish the deeper parts of the lake IMO.Bring some Rapala X-raps as well, we've taken plenty of nice fish with those, plus they are easy to vary the depth with split shots etc."
1295417,tyson2925,2011-04-16 07:24:00,95,Thanks for the info!
1296388,camp chef,2011-04-18 14:46:00,915,We will be on Pipestone for the opener in 33 days. Sarting to get a little antsy.
