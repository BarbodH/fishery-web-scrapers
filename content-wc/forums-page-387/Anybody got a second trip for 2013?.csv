1576306,skap,2013-03-20 07:44:00,58,I am pretty fortunate this year to have three trips to Sioux Lookout scheduled. 2 in June and one in September. I usually go twice but was able to sneak in another one the end of June. Was actually invited to a trip in August but I dont think that one will fly with my wife. Still worth a shot though!
1588274,wallydave,2013-03-22 22:18:00,2151,For now it looks like a two man trip to Black Bear Lodge in August! New lake new group all sounds good eh!!?
1589658,JayM5209,2013-03-23 12:42:00,1050,"1. May 25-June1 with my annual group of six (2 of us from the original group 34 yrs. ago). Just south of Perrault Falls on a different lake each day. If I can work out the logistics with the others, I'm going solo to Cliff Lake 5 days early for lakers (I'm the only retired guy with time).2. Instead of Canada, my son and I are doing something different the week of July 15. Camping on East Bearskin Lake on the Gunflint Trail. The boundary of the BWCA runs through East Bearskin so we'll do canoe day trips into different lakes.3. Doing my 2nd solo trip in September. It'll be NW Ontario and I know where, but the reservation isn't made yet. I'm holding off a bit as I work on a fishing partner of many, many years to see if my arm twisting can get him to come along."
1589866,Jigger1,2013-03-23 14:11:00,234,Oh yeah - late June and late August/early September to SWWL - only 95 days out from trip #1.

I will ask... Joe"

Wallydave, have a great 2nd trip at Blackbear! When ya going?"

My oldest will be 8 in June and too young to go on our regular trip. Plus, we want to go back to our fly-in camp. Haven't been there since we switched to a drive in camp a couple years ago.Still waiting to hear back from the outfitter. Fingers crossed he will have a few days open that align with our schedules."
