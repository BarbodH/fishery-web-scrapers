Trying to decide if I want to buy the wife and myself a 3 year license, or just the one year. They seem go up a little each year which is no big deal, buying them one year at a time. If I knew they were going to take a significant jump, I might shell out the $300 now and get a couple 3 year licenses."

After increasing our Provincial debt by $150 billion over the last ten years, the present government will need to extract even more money from everyone. Of course, taxes and fees are now being called ""revenue tools"". George Orwell would be proud.My perspective is that nothing to do with government ever gets cheaper."

1594210,pan-man,2013-03-24 19:36:00,299,I bought the new 3 year license last year not for savings but convenience. It's just one less thing to buy for the next two years. If I remember right if ordered online it is laminated and combined with outdoors card on one card.
