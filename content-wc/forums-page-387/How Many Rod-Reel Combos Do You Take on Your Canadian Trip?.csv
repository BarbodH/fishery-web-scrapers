1608297,Papa eye,2013-03-27 23:05:00,124,"Been going north for years. We target walleyes first, then northern pike, so don't need too big of rigs... Most years we only get one over ten pounds for the whole group. I take three, my $50 fenwick ultra light for finesse jigging, that catches most of the walleyes, and creates some excitement when a 5-10 lb northern hits the jig! My medium fast action rod serves as a backup for jigging, casting and in a pinch trolling. It cost under $100 for rod and reel unit, so I am ok when I need to loan it out to the poor guy that breaks his rod. And A medium heavy ugly stick for trolling crank baits and spending afternoons chasing northerns. I usually bring an extra reel. all spinning reels. say what you will but the ugly stick has lasted 20 trips north. The splake in our area are all small, so I just cast mepps with my ultra light. No bass in our area so I don't need as many as you. I used to take a baitcaster for trolling, but found I never bothered to pull it out."
1610554,Nimstug,2013-03-28 12:23:00,2605,"Four One rigged for walleye, one rigged for smallmouth, one rigged for pike, and one that stays in the box if we decided to do a bit of trolling."
1610818,Sportdog,2013-03-28 13:37:00,6735,"Well thanks so much for the responses guys, I really appreciate your input. I think that I've gained two bits of knowledge here. First, I must be pretty anal about the right tool for the job when it comes to my fishing rod/reel combinations. (I'm like that with my golf clubs also) I have not used a spinning rod for trolling in.....well, I can't remember when. Secondly I'm a little shocked at the lack of concern over back up rods and reels. I guess when you consider my concern of the right tool for the job mentality it stands to reason that back-ups would be important. I'm going to purchase one of those plastic travel cases that hold multiple rods and will take whatever they will hold since the size of the case is what it is. Reels are small so I'll make sure that I have one for each rod that I take. The most number of rods that I take in the boat will be three, depending on the plan for the day or two if I'm fishing real close to the cabin. Thanks for sharing your information guys."
1612642,Glenman12,2013-03-28 20:46:00,762,I bring one baitcaster rig for trolling with a back up..I bring one spinning rig for casting with a back up and one UL for jigging with a back up..so that would be six rods and six reels..
1613145,epiepenburg,2013-03-29 04:19:00,365,"I bring 3. Last year only used two of them. Both were relatively the same combo, one just had a heavier jig tied on. I'd cast with the lighter jig, then when we would back troll I'd switch to the heavier jigged one."
1614025,rocko0305,2013-03-29 08:18:00,138,"I will be bringing 5 to Beteau Lake this year. 2 walleye rods and 3 for pike fishing. 6'6' ML Cabela's Platinum ZX with 8# Fireline - walleye jigging 7' M Pflueger Trion with 15# Ripcord braid - walleye pitching and for Flicker Shads, Husky Jerks, etc. 7' M-XF Fenwick Smallmouth with 17# mono - finesse pike fishing using Sluggos, Flukes, topwaters, and flies 7' MH BPS Bionic Blade with 30# braid - larger pike baits, and for a pike follow-up setup 7' baitcasting Cabela's Tourney Trail with 30# braid - largest pike baits, and for trolling I would imagine that the Platinum ZX and the Fenwick will see use about 75% of the time, but I like having all the options covered."
1591210,Ranger319,2013-03-23 21:11:00,166,"I take up 15, boat partner is around 10 but then again I take up my own boat and I have a rod locker that could hold 35+combos. I have a couple extra trolling and jigging rods that I take. guys in our group always give me crap until they snap their only jigging rod then they come begging. This has saved quite a few trips. In my boat we always try to each only have 4-5 rods out at once. Trolling (lindy) rod, jigging rod, spinnerbait, rattletrap, some sort of crankbait and possibly a Grandma or Jake type bait. MY opinion is you put in so much time, effort, money, etc that I am going to have every piece of possible equipment I might need. I only get 1 week up there so I am being prepared. I always say that I would rather have it and not need it than need it and not have it."
1592098,Cash,2013-03-24 09:23:00,73,"4...my favorite spinning rod and a back-up, my favorite baitcaster and a back-up."
1600553,Mike Kansas,2013-03-26 09:21:00,1463,I take 2 back ups for jigging and 2 for Smallmouth fishing. Have only had to use backups twice in the last 50 years fishing Canada...but I was glad I had them. Mike Kansas
1600841,MrSimon,2013-03-26 10:01:00,922,"Usually take two med action 6'6"" spinning combos and a 6' ultralight spinning combo. Ultralight always has a jig on it. One med action has a steel leader on it for throwing spoons, cranks, spinners etc. Other med action is set up for bottom bouncer."
1600985,octanehi5,2013-03-26 10:33:00,1104,"I haVE BEEN DOING FLY INS FOR MORE THAN 25 YRS, 4 sets of rods and reels should cover what ever type of fishing your doing"
1601209,Stehle1,2013-03-26 11:22:00,22,7 ft. bouncer rod with baitcaster (20# braid)and flipping switch. Backup 6.5 ft bouncer rod with similar baitcaster. 7 ft. Jigging rod with 2000 spinning reel. 7 ft. Crankbait/Spoon rod with baitcaster. I'll take spare spinning reel and may take spare spinning rod. I don't jig much but I use the rest pretty heavily. The backup bouncer rod will have different color spinner rig on it and I can convert over to Spoon rod if I decide to target Pike.

1605761,wallydave,2013-03-27 11:57:00,2151,"I take a pflueger ultralite combo, a Gander Guide Series light combo. Thanks to last years Bass Pro trade-in special, I have a couple eyecon med-light fast tip rods, one with a pfleuger reel, the other a Bass Pro crappie max caster. For pike, a bass pro bait caster and a med ugly stick with a shimano reel. I like to try different lines on each rig, I'm not buying anymore mono or flouro for a while, experimenting with some different braids, just for fun!"
1606897,lcwhit,2013-03-27 16:36:00,104,"i take way too many, but i have a son and son in law that fly in to my home so i supply them also."
1606921,bassface44,2013-03-27 16:43:00,96,"I take 7 but in reality I really only use 5 or 6. One medium light jig stick, a 6'8"" medium light for a back up jig, small cranks and small jerk baits, 7' medium for larger cranks and jerkbaits. 7' mh for spinner rigs. These are all spinning outfits. For pike/musky I bring two big baitcaster combos. The seventh rod depends on the year and what we are looking to accomplish but it is meant to be a ""just in case I break one"" rod. Usually by day three I am down to 5 in the boat and maybe even four for the rest of the week."
1587170,Sportdog,2013-03-22 14:31:00,6735,"Last year was my first trip to Canada fishing and I took eight rods and reels. I only used three but we only fished for walleyes. This year we hope to branch out some and add Pike, Smallmouth, and Splake in the mix. So here is my plan, tell me what you think. Two pitching/jigging rods, one 6' ML and the other 6 1/2'M with 10/4 fireline on 1000 series spinning reels. One 6 1/2'M with 2500 series spinning reel and 8# XL mono for casting smaller baits for smallmouth. One 6 1/2'M baitcaster w/20# braid for BB and trolling smaller baits for walleye, smallmouths, and splake. One 6 1/2'MH 300 series baitcaster spooled with 17# mono for casting/trolling for pike and splake. I think that I have it covered, don't you?"
1587218,NathanH,2013-03-22 14:41:00,697,I think you can drop the two rigs below or their mate's and keep the one you like the best because you have have 4 rigs doing the work of 2. But thats just me. 6 1/2'M with 2500 series spinning reel and 8# XL mono for casting smaller baits for smallmouthandOne 6 1/2'MH 300 series baitcaster spooled with 17# mono for casting/trolling for pike and splakeHave an great trip.
1587250,Sportdog,2013-03-22 14:49:00,6735,"Thanks, I'm looking for opinions and I sure hope to have a great trip."
1587362,Burr,2013-03-22 15:35:00,8612,"I take every one that is already in the boat. It's easier that way.But then I bring my boat too...It's been a hard adjustment for me, when going on a fishing trip, pack a change of clothes, hook onto the boat, and go. Before this boat, I had to load what I wanted to take. Now, the boat is ready to go. I feel like I'm forgetting something, but I don't find myself buying another net all the time to make up for the one I used to forget at home.Net's for sale..."
1587538,NARDA 1,2013-03-22 16:32:00,636,I don't take any. I leave all my tackle at the lodge. It has been there for more than 15 years. That way I don't have to worry about carting it back and forth and the lodge knows I'll be back.
1587898,wallydave,2013-03-22 19:07:00,2151,"Too many!!! More than I usually use actually, but the one trip you don't take em you'll need em!"
1588170,packpro,2013-03-22 21:14:00,695,"You can legally only use one pole at a time. It is some of the best of fishing you will ever have in your liftime. It is not a tournament where time is precious. Enjoy your time on the water. Enjoy the scenery, comaraderie, and the moment. It won't kill you to retie. By the way, you probably brought to many lures/jigs anyway. Ask the fly in guys with weight limits. They get by with a handful of items, and have great trips. Canada is not an ego statement of I have more than you, and that makes me better. It is not a keeping up with the Jones scenario either. One good spinning combo 6'6 rod med action can cover everything. Plus a spare. If you want to learn a new set up (bait caster, fly, trolling etc.) this is the place to learn. We have guys in our group that bring $400+ combo's. They bring four or five of them. Love it when the guys who buy $59-$69 (Ugly sticks) out fish them every year. Tip sensitivity my backside (OK, if it makes you feel better) You guys are giving us line watchers a good laugh. We have one egomanic in our group who breaks a tip every year on a $250 rod. That's OK he says "" I just send it back with $10 and they send me a brand new one. We'll that tells you what it is really worth. I love it when we tell him that we only spent $10 for our rods and saved the postage and the hassle. Just a little reality call to bring him back to earth. It's Canada.....you are going catching, not fishing. The fish aren't checking to see how much you paid before biting. Wow, I feel better. Therapist charges $145/ hr. Who do I send the check to?"
1588394,jaximus,2013-03-22 23:51:00,117,"i usually bring 2. but then again i do a canoe/camping/portaging week long trip where weight and bulk play a large role in what i bring. also we cant use live bait where we go so that takes out the slip cork rods and musky lures are prohibitively large/heavy so that rod stays at home. i bring a 6'6"" medium action fast tip baitcast rod for trolling/casting cranks (anytime the paddle is in the water). for the second rod i bring either a second baitcaster (identical setup, abu c3 4600(backup rod)) or i bring a spinning jig rod with a light mono, 6lb being the norm."
1589922,Jigger1,2013-03-23 14:24:00,234,"I usually bring three, one jigging stick, one bottom bouncer and one for casting pike albeit I never use it as I cannot get myself to break away from catching eyes on LacSeul. So maybe one these years when the walleye fishing sucks I may rip it out NOT! This year I will be bringing a fourth. My new jigging stick will be rigged for everyday jig & minnow finesse fishing and my old jigging stick will be rigged for speed ripping plastics. Only 95 days until I arrive at SWWL!"
1591202,Further North,2013-03-23 21:09:00,2008,"I take my own boat, so I bring 'em all. You never know what you'll feel like doing, or what might break.I usually have a medium bait caster, a heavy bait caster, a medium light spinning rod, a medium spinning rod and a couple of fly rods in the boat. Everything else stays at the cabin in case I need a back up."
