1550985,Guest,2013-03-13 07:13:00,0,minnow we have group of 5 going to wine lake camp last week of may experienced fishermen been going to canada for 35 years what lake would suggest for lakers and what of the lakes is best for walleyes and smallmouths are the portages difficult and are they worth going does the owner charge extra ??? senior citizens but in good physical condition jim wolf the chicago boys also going to woman river camp in mid sept. (went last year but stayed at main camp) this year outpost camp because we want to fish narrow lake (portage lake near by) fished it last year for 4 hours great walleye fishing many between 18-22 golden bellies ( first time I ever witnessed this paul the owner stated the reason is the deep and dark stained water plan to fish all day 3-4x/this year your comments are welcome
1551072,FishParadise,2013-03-13 09:18:00,7,Minaki is 30 miles north of Kenora on hwy 596 with 4 smaller lakes and 1 big lake on the Winnipeg river system out of lake of the Woods. Half the walleyes are over 20 in. and my friend caught 6 musky one day with 30 follows. Bass and pike are everywhere also. Check out Paradisecoveminaki.com for $ 45.00 a night cabins.
1551079,camp chef,2013-03-13 09:29:00,915,"Also check bignorthlodge.com on the same water in Minaki but removed from all the boat traffic right in Minaki. Great cabins,great people and great fishing"
1552393,HeHooksHimself,2013-03-14 08:32:00,725,"If there is one thing IL Scott and I agree upon it is the choice of Wine Lake. You can feel free to PM me as well since we have been going there regularly for 13 years and know the water well. We will have a group of four for the opener in 63 days.To Jim Wolf: Herb does charge extra for the Portages. Most of them are short walks and easy to traverse. Typical charge is $50/boat on Little Trout, Anishinabi. Portage to Tipover is $15 for shaky jon boat with oars. That time of year the trout will still be shallow and you should be able to catch them casting or trolling crankbaits. you will also catch a few jigging for walleyes in Dynamite or the main lake. How 'bout them Irish!"
1554673,Guest,2013-03-14 17:17:00,0,go irish !! thank you for your help on wine lake I appreciate it jim wolf chicago boys
1561433,ksand774,2013-03-16 08:35:00,51,Thanks for the info on Cedar Lake I did fish that 5 or 6 years agoand was not very impressed with the fishing. It was a odd year thoughwere the lake level had gone up about 6 ft before we got there that mightof affected it. We did trailer our boat to Ord Lake and did quite well.
1591570,Kevin R,2013-03-24 06:52:00,305,For those that have Fished Wine lake is it still very clear water it's been a very long time since I have fished it at that time vis on a calm day was over 10 feet & Wabaskang was over 5 foot but last time I fished Wabaskang it was less than 2 ft.
1594610,HeHooksHimself,2013-03-24 21:20:00,725,"Wine Lake is stained and visibility is perhaps 5 ft. One lake in the chain, Ghost Lake is pretty clear, perhaps 5-10 ft. Obviously, time of year and sun power have an impact."
1594969,stillangling,2013-03-25 04:52:00,149,"Took a look at your previous posts. Paradise Cove, Paradise Cove, Paradise Cove...one of them even mentions ""Winnipeg river running off our docks."" Sounds possessive to me. The only exception was ""when does the walleye season open in Minaki?"" By chance Paradise Cove is located there. Most would refer to that as a ""bump."" Recommendations for a resort from people who have a vested interest in a business that is not disclosed? The right word is schill. Legitimate fishing reports and techniques from owners/employees are appreciated and are a good way to gain exposure for your business and let people know what you are like as an individual. Unfortunately this approach will involve a little more ""investment"" in the site."
1595218,Skywagon,2013-03-25 06:42:00,1106,"stillangling, I caught that also, but was going to let him make one more post before calling him on it. Kind of pathetic wasn't it? probably the way he runs the business too."
1548671,ksand774,2013-03-08 14:52:00,51,"I am looking for a small to medium lake in sunset country or north of superior Ontario. We would like a drive in or boat in with a modern cabin. A outpost would work as well. We prefer to be away from busy roads andenjoy bringing fish back home with us. The more varieties of fish the better. Preferred fish would be walleye, northern, perch and Smallies.Trout would be a plus. We are looking to go sometime in July.I am not sure probably 2nd or 3rd week. Thanks"
1548986,plumberjoe,2013-03-09 09:13:00,54,"Canyon lake north of Vermillion Bay might fit your needs walleye,smallmouth,perch, and musky also a couple northern lakes close by. Three resorts on lake all of which are decent, I have stayed at North Country Lodge six times."
1549011,ftfarms,2013-03-09 10:06:00,444,I would try cedar lake by Perrault falls. we stayed at cedar point resort. The owners are great people to talk with and you drive four miles off 105 so you don't have to hear that noise. The store is only 11 miles north of camp if you need anything. Walleye and smallmouth fishing is good that time of year.
1549028,Bill Krejca,2013-03-09 10:29:00,6107,"O'Sullivan's Rainbow near Nakina. Eyes, pike, lake trout, perch, also speckled trout in nearby lakes. LOW has probably one of the greatest amount of different species - you never know what you're liable to pull in. Bill"
1549122,fishguide1800,2013-03-09 14:59:00,84,"Give lost bay resort a look,very peacefull place,med sized lake,unreal smallmouth bass fishing,pike and muskie,great lake trout,walleyes that are hard to catch due to crystel clear water,wont be dissappointed"
1549197,Davis Viehbeck,2013-03-09 18:48:00,48,"Take a look at the Clearwater Pipestone Chain of Lakes north of Emo, Ontario. These lakes are about 1hr 30 minutes from the IFalls border. Bass, Walleye, Pike, Musky, Lakers."
1549206,GNO,2013-03-09 19:29:00,153,"We have a boat in outpost on Pipestone Lake that may be perfect for your group. If you have any questions, let me know."
1549231,Glenman12,2013-03-09 20:22:00,762,"I have to second Cedar Lake...6500 acres..narrow, wont get blown off..I have fished out of Cedar Lake Lodge which is on a boat to island..cant get anymoe remote than that..but if you book a lodge on this lake make sure they can set you up on Cliff Lake right across hwy 105 so you can spend a day chasing Lakers which is what we did last year.."
1550752,ksand774,2013-03-12 18:36:00,51,Thanks for the resort / lake info.I appreciate the info.Has anyone fished a resort that fishes multiple lakes?I was also interseted if anyone has fished Caribou lake.
1550765,ILScott,2013-03-12 18:55:00,139,Wine lake has four smaller lakes connected to it and you can also access Wabaskang and Annishinabi by a portage. It is a 26 mile boat ride back to camp across Wabaskang and through a river system. All the species of fish that you want. Any questions just private message me.
