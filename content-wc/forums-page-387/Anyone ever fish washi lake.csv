Has anyone been there? Would you recommend it? How was the camp and boats? We went to Percy lake this past year for our first ever fly in and it was awesome. Leuenbergers were great to deal with, but now we want to go further north (also love the idea about catching a bunch of bookies). Thanks"

We fished it in June,cant rememeber exactly wht week. There is a channel between bodies of water and we trolled this for hrs,with double headers. Then at the end of the lake where your cabin would be(west) tucked away in a bay, same thing. Unbelievable quantity of 18-20"" walleyes. The channel also produced many large pike,35-39"". We were told after that across from our cabin(east end) of the lake is the connection to the Albany river, and sitting there with the right tackle has produced some amazing sturgeon. Washi is a fantastic lake and our group would have always gone back,except TLO dint go there anymore and it is along flight from Nakina. enjoy!"
