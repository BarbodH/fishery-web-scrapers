We hired a guide for one day but it really wasn't necessary. I would love to go back next year for the fishing, but the rest of the group has reservations due to the condition of the cabins. I was told the dogs were loose to keep the bears away, but when those dogs start barking they can keep you up all night."

524044,Andyeye,2002-09-05 05:39:00,179,"Stayed there 3 years ago also in September. The fishing was really pretty good. We rented a cabin so I do not know about there American Plan. I was not happy with the service we got. We had to wait a couple of mornings to purchase minnows. I don't remember a single conversation we had with any member of the staff maybe they are just shy. We caught fish in Vaughn Lake and the main lake up on Pine Point which is a good boat ride from the lodge if you only have a 40 horse like me. I would go back for the fishing but not the service, maybe you will have better luck with the American Plan. Good luck! if you would like more info you can Email me."

You need to be aware that these folks offer very very little customer service. As long as you are self contained you will be just fine. But do not expect the same service as the other owners offer. My personal feeling is that the tribe lodges are just not under the same pressure to make a profit and consequently they have little or not need to cultivate the skills needed to offer the kind of service that the ""for profit"" owners MUST have."

524047,Guest,2002-09-12 22:03:00,0,have been going to Mahkwa for about 10-12 years now. have to agree with andyeye and jimmy that you'll be fine if you're going to fish.we don't use the american plan so i can't comment on that service. we go in expecting little or no personal service and are never let down. they do have a vast amount of fishing area with little lodge competition that makes the experience more remote than the crowded lodge areas. fall fishing there is supposed to be outstanding though.good luck 7 out

524051,Walleye Wacker,2002-10-02 13:04:00,6,Are you talking about Lac Seul lodge ran by Dan McDonald ? If so we have stayed with Dan for ten years and I think his service is #1.
