524709,LyleK,2002-10-04 14:55:00,248,Anyone have any preferences on fishing either Red River at Selkirk or the Winnipeg River at Pine Falls? Either of the two easier to fish or more predictable?Any insight is appreciated.Thanks

524711,gms,2002-10-06 18:21:00,91,My preference is Pine Falls. The one thing the Red has over Pine Falls is the fact that the conditions will never keep you off the Red. Pine Falls in winds around 30km range can make for some difficult and potentially dangerous fishing conditions.Anything over 35km from the NW or N will pretty much prevent you from accessing Traverse Bay to do some precision trolling regardless of how big your rig is.Pine Falls has a larger variety of fishing structure to fish than the red.Water quality and clarity is much more appetizing at Pine Falls.
