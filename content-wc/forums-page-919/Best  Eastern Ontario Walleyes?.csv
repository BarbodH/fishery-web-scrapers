The St. Lawrence River in and around the Cornwall area also provides great fishing. Guides are available and a few are members here. The fall months offer excellent fishing with very little competition. Most folks put their boats away after labor day and miss out on the years best period.If you need more detail send me an email and I'll do what I can to get you with the right person or situation."
