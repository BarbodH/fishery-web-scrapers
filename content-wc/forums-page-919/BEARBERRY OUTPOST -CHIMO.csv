Most fish were 20' + deeper, caught mostly on 1/4 with some 3/8 on windy days. Boats & motors were fine, no bear problems. My e-mail is [email protected] Dave"

524682,Guest,2002-10-03 07:24:00,0,"HI,I AM JUST WONDERING IF ANYONE HAS BEEN TO BEARBERRY OUTPOST ON WARWICK LAKE. THIS IS ONE OF CHIMO OUTFITTERS LAKES OUT OF RED LAKE.IF YOU HAVE BEEN THERE LET ME KNOW HOW IT WAS.THANKS,ROBBY"
524683,pnnylfr,2002-10-03 11:36:00,114,Have fished Bearberry 3 times since 1997. Trying to get back in. It has been booked up on the dates I want. Fishing was good to excellent. Cabins were good. Boats and motor were good. Fished mainly for walleye although there are plenty of northern to be had. I have a map somewhere that I'll dig out if you want more info.
524684,Guest,2002-10-03 12:29:00,0,"Pnnylfr,We are primarily Walleye fisherman. What was the average size you caught. Any big ones. We went to keeper lake this year and caught a lot of walleyes mostly 15"" to 17"". Next year we have more guys going so we booked Bearberry. We hope to have as good a year as this year was.robby"
524685,pnnylfr,2002-10-04 05:05:00,114,"Robby,I would say the majority of the fish were 15""-17"", but we did catch a nice mix with many in the 17""-21"" class. We had 8-10 guys in our group and always ended up with a few 25""-30"". Warwick has a number of rapids and narrows that are very good spots, but don't neglect the portages as they are good producers also. We used 1/4 and 3/8 ounce jigheads with a leach or crawler. Had a good chat with a group that came in as we were leaving, they use all artificial with great results.When are you going."
524686,Guest,2002-10-04 07:42:00,0,"Pnnylfr,What time of year do you go? We go in september 13th. Were there any bear problems? Do you still have your map? I'll give you my address if you make a copy for me.Thanks,Robby"
524687,Dave,2002-10-04 08:19:00,258,"Robby:How was Keeper? We exchanged e-mails before your trip this past August. Are you going to Bearberry the week of Sept. 13, 2003? We fished Bearberry this year and can offer some advice.Dave"
524688,Guest,2002-10-04 09:14:00,0,"Dave,Keeper was great. You could catch walleyes everywhere. Right in front of the cabin was the best spot on the lake. Also hidden lake was excellent. All fish were between 15"" and 19"" but very fat broad shouldered fish.The only reason were are moving next year is because we have 10 guys going. We had nine in Keeper this year and it is really only an eight man cabin. Too crowded! Let me know the info you have on Bearberry.Thanks,Robby"
524689,pnnylfr,2002-10-04 10:39:00,114,"Robby,We always went the second week of July. I found the map, I'll send you some copies. You can e-mail me your address at [email protected]"
