524677,Guest,2002-10-03 04:30:00,0,"I'm planning a ""family"" trip up into the Kawarthas for next summer and am looking for information on the lakes in that area. I've been to Pigeon Lake near Bobcaygeon many times, but found the walleye fishing to be in serious decline through the 1990's. It's a good area for a family trip though, and hence the question.What is the best walleye lake in the Kawarthas area with a good chance for bass (smallmouth and largemouth) and muskie? Is Pigeon still good? Buckhorn? Balsam? Please advise. Thanks for the info."

Some of my friends still go.It is a pretty good lake with fair to good 'eyes, LM/SM bass, perch, and muskie. The only big fish you have a real good chance to catch is muskie. A big 'eye is 3 lb (personal best was 5lb) and perch get a lot of pressure and run small. SM bass are really coming back, I'm told (my biggest was 5lb). LM bass have always been plentiful, with a chance of fish up to 5 pounds. There are some HUGE musky in that lake and lots of nice size ones. Tons of weedbeds and every spot looks like it should hold fish. This makes it a little difficult to fish, if you don't know the lake. My friends tell me that since the zebra mussles (or Quagga) have been introduced, the water is more clear now! It used to have 10-15 ft visability!!Tim"

With the introduction of Zebra mussles in the last 6? years, the water is extreamly clear. That makes Lovesick weather dependent. Look for stable weather. Overcast skies are what you need to catch fish. Have a bright, sunny, day and fishing is very tough."
524681,Guest,2002-10-10 15:03:00,0,Vote # 2 for stoney lake. It is the farthest away from metro Toronto and the hardest to navigate so it gets less fishing pressure.It is also the most scenic Kawartha lake.
