524794,Bobby,2002-10-13 23:47:00,211,"I was one of the unlucky ones to get no fish. Pre-fishing started out great (28"" fish) but got worse. We 'bet all on Traverse' for pre-fishing, but got pounded out of there both tourny days. Day one, got so badly swamped over the bow by several waves and nearly had hypothermia. Then, the bite was so light in the river, couldn't get a good hookset and lost a couple nice ones. Ouch. It was humiliating until I saw the masses in the same boat as myself!! Learned a few lessons out there."
524795,gms,2002-10-14 07:14:00,91,"Must say I was ""banking"" on the Lake when pre-fishing also....as Flatland says I appreciate all the hard work that goes into this tourney. As always there is always something to learn each time out.....this time it was ""pre-fish the river more"" and secondly ""know the safety limitations of your craft""."
524784,Guest,2002-10-06 17:27:00,0,"Fished traverse bay Thurs, Fri, Sat. Thurs was OK - our boat had 20 fish - 2 (8-9lb), 1 (7lb), 1 (5lb) and the remaining between 16-19 inches. Fri was extremly slow 8 fish for the day. Sat was even worse. Water temp was 52. We left early Sun morning and air temp was 15 deg F. Its probably 1-2 wks away from prime. The water flow is very low - watch the rock piles. Best of luck."
524785,gms,2002-10-06 18:23:00,91,"Fished Pine Falls - Sunday October 6,2002Caught 5 on crankbaits in Traverse Bay and 4 jigging the first rock pile going out to the lake. Still slow by my standards. Traffic at the boat launch was heavy at 7am."
524786,Guest,2002-10-06 20:50:00,0,"Thursday boated 12 fish, all good eating size from 17-21""Friday boated 0 fish and were blown off and quit by 1pmSaturday, did fairly well boating 14 good quality fish.Sunday, did very well. Quit at noon. Fished and caught 20 walleyes, largest was 31"" and several in the 23-25"" range. Definately improving!"
524787,jason,2002-10-07 08:24:00,12,"Fishing dog, How did you catch your fish? Cranks or jigs?thanks"
524788,Guest,2002-10-07 11:31:00,0,"We almost strickly pulled cranks in the AM by Robertson Reef...(Rock pile in the bay). Best were the #9 Rapala Shad Raps in various colors. Color didn't seem to matter. We would look for subtle variations of bottom contour and focused on those areas. Also, we did our best first thing in the morning right after sunlight. Traveled in the dim morning light. GOOD LUCK!"
524789,Bobby,2002-10-07 17:31:00,211,"Saturday (Oct 5th) was my first time out at the mouth of the Winnipeg River. Spent a few hours getting to know the river and a bit of the bay. We didn't catch any fish and didn't see a whole lot of boats with their nets out either. Spoke to some people who concurred with this. Sunday (Oct 6th), however, was different. Caught some greenbacks with one 28 inches. Later in the day, however, we ran into some bass and a carp. Pretty much everyone seemed to be doing better on Sunday. However, it was sure cold in the am (-8 celcius)."
524790,chrism,2002-10-08 18:43:00,429,"Finally hit the water Sat/Sun/Mon...Sat/Sun were on the Red, with great sauger action and only a few greenies - nothing big. All were caught on Jig/minnow combo. Didn't even get a bite trolling.Monday was at Pine falls, with a late start - we were on the water at 1030 till about 530pm. Caught lots of small (<16"") fish and only 9 over 19"", biggest at 23.5"". Had a couple of good thumps trolling, but was unable to land them!It was a zoo with the boats, and especially frustrating when boats would pull up beside us when we were catching fish - almost smacked one dork on the head with my fishing rod he was so close....I spent most of the days bustin loose from the crowds. Jigs worked well.My impression is the fish are there - look out if we get a stable weather pattern - could be great action! Just wish there was a courtesy rule that others would follow - ie - keep 50yds away from other boats!cm"
524791,gms,2002-10-09 17:46:00,91,"I second your sediments 'chrism', it was like bumper boats on Sunday.Just got back from Pine Falls (Wed - Oct 9, 2002) fishing was again extremely slow, fished from 7:30am till 3:30am and only boated 4 walleye. 1 on a crankbait and 3 others jigging. (only one of size was exactly 22"").Watched one of the ""locals"" empty his net (just NW of Robinson's Rock Pile)....was not very much in the net. Winds were howling from the South at about 30km-50km, made for some difficult trolling."
524792,gms,2002-10-13 18:59:00,91,Just finished 3 straight days fishing Pine Falls. (2 in the tourney).NW winds have pounded Traverse Bay for 3 straight days and the water is as murky as the Red in the middle of summer. Fishing has been borderline humiliating as the tourney results proved.30+ boats out of 110 weighed no fish on Saturday and today was no exception.Had 4 fish for a total of 4.76lbs on the first day and was in 23rd place! Witnessed 3 - 8lb+ fish get boated at the mouth today.....hopefully this is a sign of things to come as this has been a poor Fall run at Pine Falls.
524793,flatland fisherman,2002-10-13 20:06:00,29,"Just got back from Pine Falls pre fished Friday and two days in the tourney. Friday was fair about 8 fish 1 at 27 and several 18 Â– 20. Saturday was brutal 6-8'waves on the lake and as high as 4' on the river in places. We were one of the lucky boats that did not get skunked, 1 fish and in the middle of the pack. Today not so lucky two fish under 1 lb. However witnessed a nice hawge landed just before 3 pm over 8 lb. Although the fishing was very tough and the weather was less than ideal, the tourney was very enjoyable. The volunteers put in a lot of hard work and everything was first class. We made some new friends from both sides of the border, swaped some lies, and that's what it is all about. Congrats to the winners as we all know who where there, it took a lot of hard work and patience."
