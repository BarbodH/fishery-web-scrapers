524471,Bradnd,2002-10-10 07:30:00,507,"Got back yesterday. Weather was cold & damp. Fishing was ok, but not much for big fish being caught. We only managed to keep 4 under the slot. Threw back about 4-5 per day in the slot, with a 28 in. being the biggest. Best luck was the white rock area pulling bombers in 18ft. Dark purple was our best color. Started letting more water out on Tues., so there was a few more weeds floating around. Should be real good in another week or 2. Remember, they have increased the slot size from 28 in. to 31.5 inches. The low end of the slot stayed at 21.7 inches. So bring a camera with!!Take care,Brad"

524457,Bryan,2002-10-06 09:05:00,244,"Was at Tobin for the tourney. Partner and I placed 17th. Used Lindy rigs with a 6-8 foot 6# mono leader and a # 10 Gami red or Chartruese hook loaded with 2 or 3 leeches. Tried a bead about a foot up but had better luck without the bead. Current came and went all weekend and was better bite with the current. Only weighed 5 fish for the tournament but 2 were over 10#. Going back up to fish the 12th and 13th. T-Mac, if your on the water on the 13th look me up and if were onto anything I'll let you know. I'll be in a red 2050 Crestliner with a 225 Evinrude. Here's a pic of one that my partner Randy caught that put us in the money.http://www.fishin4eyes.com/PageAlbum...14Fullview.htmhttp://www.monarch.net/users/hauffco...pics/17th3.jpg"

524467,Lundman 1700,2002-10-07 06:39:00,65,"Hey Waliwz, how did you make out? Did you have any trouble getting leeches? They should be starting to get hard to find pretty soon. I'm heading up there from the 13th to the 16th and I want to make sure I've got a good supply of leeches to take with me."
524468,Waliwz,2002-10-07 18:13:00,23,Hey LundmanIt snowed the night prior to us leaving ..so my boat was full of leaves and snow ..the road was all ice..it was cold ....the fishing was slow....but besides that had a great time :) The store on top the hill still had lots of leaches ...so that is where we got them...they were small but active .There were some nice fish caught ...just not by me grinbest I did was a 5lb eye my bro got a 6.7 lb eyewe only got 5 or 6 fish all day.Tmac's friends got a nice 10 lber first thing in the morn. I belive that was the best one we heard about Now the day before on sat the story is that the fishing was much better.The weather in town today was rain on and off all day ..glad I was at home today...would of made yesterday look warm!!Well not sure what else I can tell u eceept good luck and remeber to bring your long handles lolGood fishing and hunting. pass it on ...take a youngster
524469,Lundman 1700,2002-10-07 18:55:00,65,I wouldn't think of leaving home without the combos. If the weather ever settles out for a couple of days the fishing should pick up. Has anyone had any luck fishing for big jack in the lake?
524456,Guest,2002-10-08 10:01:00,0,"I'll still be there on the 15th.C'mon over..I'll be on the river.I'll be the good looking older guy in the 2003 black/silver 1900 Pro-V IFS and I'll probably have a fish on.PS: There is another guy with us who has a 1900 Pro-V IFS black/silver, also...but he is UGLY, and probably won't have a fish on.! You'll be able to tell which is whom real easy!LOL!"

524451,Lundman 1700,2002-10-02 13:35:00,65,"A good friend of mine is at Tobin right now. I couldn't make the trip with them this year, but he had to phone me last night, {to rub it in}, to let me know that he had caught a 13lb. 2oz. walleye yesterday. The big girls must be coming because there were a few big ones caught at the Vanity, also. Lindy rigs with leeches was what was working at the tournament and my friend caught his cranking by the dam. Hope the weather holds for another couple of weeks and then I'll have my chance at a Tobin monster. Man, do I love the fall."

524464,Guest,2002-10-05 12:19:00,0,At the vanity everyone used lindy rigs and leeches. Use a small hook #6 and experiment with colors and snell lenghts. In the tournament long snells seem to work(10'+).It was won by the(grassy)and about 75% of boats fished there. Shartruse beed in front of the hook seemed to turn them on. Big fish of the tourney was 14.50lb.
