524134,Guest,2002-09-09 12:59:00,0,would you guys try to convince harlan that he should in fact make the trip to winnipeg river again this year. he caught a trophy last year and now he is holding out on us on going this year. he is undecided. he needs your help on his decision on going. thanks
524135,Guest,2002-09-09 14:02:00,0,"Harlan, Remove your head from between your legs. Close your eyes for a minute and remember the excitment of that big old Greenback tugging on that rod and stripping that line off of your reel. Think about how you felt when you first got your hands on Mrs. Greenback and held her up so your buddys could Kodak the moment. Harlan, dont forget all the other good times you had with your Pals laughing and enjoying the trip and kidding each other. Remember all the times this winter that your mind wandered back to that big old Walleye and the fun you have in Canada....Harlan if you dont go ...I WILL"
524136,Guest,2002-09-09 14:07:00,0,"Harlan, There are thousands of us out here who would give our left one to catch Pine Falls Walleye this fall. Fish for us man... GO HARLAN GO"
524137,Guest,2002-09-12 21:57:00,0,"Guys your input is great, however Harlan still needs your help. I still have not heard him say yes yet. I truely believe he is scared of being out fished. Please keep the responses coming."

There are way to many fisherman and boats for you to be able to catch another trophy again there in your lifetime. It was a fluke that you caught that one last year. Since you have the opportunity to fish some of the biggest walleyes in the world and you have decided not to go, that tells me you are not a true outdoorsman. Let someone else go that can truly appreciate the fishing. The fishing is not any good there this year anyway so stay home. I know many people who are offering to stay in my room since they get booked up well before May. (A little truth and a little reverse psychology...lets see how much of a fisherman he really is!)"
524139,Guest,2002-10-05 17:51:00,0,"I JUST WANTED TO INFORM EVERYONE HARLAN IS GOING TO PINE FALLS SOLELY BECAUSE OF YOUR INPUT. HE COULD NOT TAKE THE PRESSURE AND GAVE IN. WE ARE HAPPY HE IS GOING, BUT WE ALL ARE WELL AWARE HE WILL STILL BE OUT FISHED."
