I can not imagine how some who comes along and sees that there are 80+ boat trailers parked all the way up the hill not wonder why these spots are left open? Does this person think they were reserved just for them."
524797,Guest,2002-10-06 19:39:00,0,I WOULD AGREE TOTALLY WITH WHAT YOU HAD TO SAY. ALSO IT IS VERY DISTURBING WHEN PEOPLE TAKE UP THE ENTIRE LANDING WITH THEIR VEHICLE AND TRAILER WHILE LOADING OR UNLOADING. THERE IS ROOM FOR THREE TRAILERS IF YOU DO IT RIGHT. ALSO PEOPLE NEED TO HAVE EVERYTHING READY TO LOAD OR UNLOAD. NOT TAKING ONE ITEM OUT OF VEHICLE AT A TIME AND PUT IN BOAT WHILE EVERYONE ELSE HAS PLANNED AHEAD.
