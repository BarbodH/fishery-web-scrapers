524667,kingsway,2002-10-02 16:47:00,27,"I fished Maynard Lake about 10 years ago and had a fantastic time. I have fished Canada many times and this one ranks up there with the best of them. There were 12 of us guys from a church group that flew in from Vermillion Bay and stayed in tents on the N/E end of the lake for 7 days. The fishing was great and I have thought of making a return trip some time. I really believe that there is a way to drive to this lake and stay in a tent or camper, but I havn't found a map detailed enough to try it. It seems to be a well kept secret to find detailed maps of their roads. If you find a way to drive there message me to let me know. Good luck,Rich"

No monster walleyes but i caught 48 walleyes myself from 8:00 am till noon. Average 2 lbs. and up to 26"".Very relaxing fishing here as your every need is taken care of. It's not for everyone but if you like being spoiled? Did catch a 40"" Northern jigging for walleye and by next year he will be 45""."
