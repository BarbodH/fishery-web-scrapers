1899690,Bill Krejca,2013-06-26 13:31:00,6107,"I am in the habit of cutting out the ""Doc"" stories and stapling them together. Saves a lot of space over keeping the entire magazine. Re: The magazine - I believe there are still a number of interesting articles and opportunities for me to learn something new from them. Bill"
1899954,Gregking,2013-06-26 15:34:00,2658,I also like the north with doc stories
1901162,Gregking,2013-06-26 21:58:00,2658,"I just grabbed the pile of mags I haven't read yet and your right, north with doc is gone. Greg knowels died 2 years ago?"
1901226,Guest,2013-06-26 22:17:00,0,That is incorrect. The up north stories continue to be published in In Fisherman.
1901938,fourt2,2013-06-27 08:10:00,45,"North with Doc was in the issue I just picked up. My point (admittedly unclear) was that one of the characters--the plant manager--seemed to have vanished, and I inadvertently hijacked the thread asking what happened. I believe the ""he died"" response was in relation to the plant manager character, not the author.My apologies for starting this confusion!-42"
1901994,Gregking,2013-06-27 08:19:00,2658,June didn't have it

1430594,elway12,2012-05-04 09:22:00,335,"I know some here are not big fans of the In-Fisherman magazine but I sometimes pickup some helpful tips. But my comment is that I really enjoy reading the stories ""North with Doc"" by Greg Knowles at the end of each edition. His stories are mostly about his trips to Canada with his group of friends. Many of these stories are like the many we share here on W.C. I didn't know if anyone else had read them and enjoyed them as much as me?"
1430615,Smallmouth Hunter,2012-05-04 09:55:00,84,It's mostly the only reason I get the magazine. I have kept all the old issues with North with Doc in them and I re-read them every year before my trip to LOW.
1430641,erieangler,2012-05-04 10:51:00,57,Yep.. used to look forward to his articals when I was a subscrider. His writing has a way of making you relate and chuckle. Very enertaining
1430656,Walleye_Wrangler,2012-05-04 11:38:00,138,I love Greg Knowles stories. We had his book in the cabin. I reread it every year. Great stories! Another author i love is Patrick F. McManus. I use to laugh so hard.Here is a quick one:http://www.calguns.net/calgunforum/a.../t-346552.html
1430700,HeHooksHimself,2012-05-04 13:14:00,725,"Ever since this has been posted, I have been a little troubled by the sentence, ""I know some of you are not big fans of In-Fisherman."" What is the reasoning behind people not being big fans of In Fisherman. I mean what could be the downside?"
1430705,Smallmouth Hunter,2012-05-04 13:38:00,84,For some reason I don't like Doug Stange. Don't know why.
1430707,elway12,2012-05-04 13:44:00,335,I have seen some/many references(negative) to the show and magazine on W.C. so that's what I was referring. I am too weak of fisherman to be critical of the show or magazine To each their own.
1430712,octanehi5,2012-05-04 13:55:00,1104,"It was a bad day when they did away with the walleye mag. al lender and that group . It still is just ok as a fishing mag. They need more info from real fishermen. A Doug Stange or any one for that matter can go to the bay of Quinte, or other high dollar outfitters, That 80 % of fishermen today can not afford it. There are a lot of good shows on WFN network that show alot more than infisherman"
1430871,Pooch,2012-05-04 20:53:00,4619,"When ever I read North with Doc I just chuckle inside. His stories parallel so much of our old group. We even have our own ""Doc"". A retired country vet who is about as laid back as anyone you will ever fish with. Just look at my album here on WC.Sometimes when reading North with Doc I would swear the story was about our guys.Look at the pictures of groups of guys who go to Canada together. We all look about the same! You could mix and match most groups and not change the flavor of any of them. Seems everyone goes to be with some of their best friends and that is probably the biggest draw for a trip.Glad I'm not the only one who really enjoys the stories. I also like it when there is a thread about other guys trips here on WC. Might make a good new forum. ""Trip Stories"".Pooch"
1899586,fourt2,2013-06-26 12:51:00,45,"Always liked the North with Doc...but sort of got away from reading In-Fisherman for a while. When I checked back in a few months ago, (as a Plant Manager) I was horrified to discover that my favorite character seems to have disappeared (replaced by The Kid).Anybody know what happened?-42"
