I was hoping someone could throwout a few areas of the lake or some go to lures/colors.(before someone says it, yes I've searched the forum for info first We are actually portaging in and camping so we will not have the benefit of any advice from the lodge. With so much water to cover for the first time we plan on focusing on the eastern half of the lake for the week. I was also curious how far you can go down the river in a 14ft boat. Can you get far enough down to where the brookies are hiding? Any advice/info is appreciated."
1897746,Curryale,2013-06-25 19:21:00,50,We portaged into the lake for a week 2 years ago from stinger lake. We fished near the end of July and almost exclusively in the eastern half of the lake. The walleye fishing was excellent. When we were there the weather was very hot and we caught most of our fish 15 feet down over deep water. Used spinners and fish weights. When we stopped to fish a deep hump we used gulp minnows and jig heads. Caught lots of whitefish in the deep basin on jigging spoons.
1900010,unclepaully,2013-06-26 16:04:00,112,Curryale-Thanks for the info. Since we have quite a bit gear to portage I was curious what kind of condition the trail is in? We were thinking of modifying a jet sled with wheels and using it to pull gear in. Were the whitefish hugging bottom in the 50-70ft range or were they suspended over the deep water? I'm not real familiar with summer fishing for whitefish but wouldn't mind trying. I know ice fishing for them on little bay de noc in Michigan we use a dead minnow just an inch or two off bottom. Did you guys venture down the Esnagami river at all? I am curious if we can get into brook trout water or if they will have moved beyond our reach at that point in the summer.
1901066,chris.brock,2013-06-26 21:32:00,112,"don't bother with the sled, the portage is short, flat, and well travelledif going down the river, use a temperature probe to try to locate the springs that time of year, you can line your boat down the rapidsit's a pretty unique lake, a great lake too, 1 recommendation, buy extra stick baits/ minnow baits (ie husky jerk, smithwick rogue style stuff), but just cheap ones (rebel?), these maybe the ticket and it's pretty snaggy, that's from my experience"
