1906330,Hunter1943,2013-06-28 14:57:00,4,"I called two days ago and found the following: Kakabecca Falls from Larry $38.00, Ignace from Verne's $44.00, Lake Savant Troy & Penny's $35.00. I did talk to the trapper in Ignace and he said they were starting to Pod and probably would not have any by August 1st. Best to call ahead and have some reserved."
