1158496,stumcfar,2010-01-07 08:29:00,451,Nobody has ever stayed in this outpost???
1158598,brn2fsh,2010-01-07 15:09:00,49,"We've not stayed there, but have fished there. Ghost narrows is AWESOME!!!"
1159814,LoDo,2010-01-12 19:12:00,721,"I have not stayed at the outpost, however I have been all over McKenzie Bay. The Ghost Narrows are awesome, big and little sands are good in early spawn and I love going to the little island as far NE as you can go in McKenzie bay."
1159908,WalleyeWally28,2010-01-13 09:04:00,298,My wife and I have fished Lac Seul for the past 13 years. We always stay up close to Ear Falls but spend 90% of our time fishing McKenzie and on south thru Ghost Narrows. Don't know anything about the outpost but you would be located in the middle of some of the best fishing LS has to offer.
1160206,stumcfar,2010-01-14 12:11:00,451,Thanks guys. We have booked the outpost and are already looking forward to it!

1897314,KTroller,2013-06-25 15:53:00,237,"stumcfar, how was the McKenzie Bay Outpost when you stayed there a few years back? I know the fishing is good in that area, more interested in the cabin, general experience.Thanks,KT"
