1898738,bushy,2013-06-26 07:51:00,17,Headed up to Onaway lodge tomorrow. Reports have been few and far between. Not sure if that's bad or good. Anybody have any recent reports from that area of the lake. How are the May flies. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks

Flew over Lac Seul yesterday on the way to a remote lake north of there, (about the same section we fished Sunday) and in some areas the water was really yellow, probably from Monday's heavy winds. You'll do well, hard not to on Lac Seul. Good luck."
1899378,Guest,2013-06-26 11:50:00,0,Fished out of Goose Bay this week and we thought the fishing was awesome. We had 4 and caught 70-100 over the slot and great eaters. The northerns were also plentiful while fishing jigs for the eyes. Largest walleye was 27 and largest northern 37.
1899394,Guest,2013-06-26 11:54:00,0,We fished around Lunker point and sand bank across from there. Also caught many in steamboat. Felt this was the best we had in this area in 5+ years. We also made the trip to Makenzie bay sand banks and northern part and did awesome as usual.
