1904458,Skywagon,2013-06-28 05:21:00,1106,"Kidsfishing, there is no significant shortcut, not even bush roads, the lakes get in the way. In the winter by snowmobile, it is possible to cut a half hour off the trip, from one point on 502 to 72."
1904690,lcwhit,2013-06-28 06:55:00,104,we just use the road behind the paper plant. saves a lot of time in town. all paved.
1907226,Skywagon,2013-06-28 20:41:00,1106,"Going the route behind the paper mill (west side) is a longer distance and one more stop light, as opposed to going on the south side of the mill and straight through to highway 17. The upside to the behind the mill route, is that is you go right past the Dairy Queen."
1908698,lcwhit,2013-06-29 15:46:00,104,"don't confuse me with facts. I was pretty proud of myself when I figured out that shortcut. too old to try something new, I guess. thanks."
1900074,mswope13,2013-06-26 16:49:00,73,Can anyone tell me the best route to take from heading north on 502 just south of Dryden to 17 west? We have been heading into Dryden for years and it seems like we are back tracking....Any help would be greatly appreciated!
1900146,camp chef,2013-06-26 17:10:00,915,"At the north end of 502 you come to an intersection, Dryden to your right.....go left about a 1/2 mile or so to Adams Rd. It will come out on 17 by Oxdrift. There is about 5 miles of gravel but the last time we were on it ot was in good condition and faster than going through Dryden"
1900178,2746,2013-06-26 17:17:00,3206,That works well unless its been raining. That gravel is really dirty and if your pulling a boat it will take a power wash to clean it. If its wet go right until you get to a north bound hard surface road on the back side of the paper mill. Go north to 17. Less of a back track and no gravel.
1900610,mswope13,2013-06-26 19:59:00,73,Thank you fellows!
1900810,kidsfishing,2013-06-26 20:32:00,12,How much time does the short cut save you????
1900914,Terwalleye,2013-06-26 20:57:00,166,"Short cut saves 20 minutes. Only the first mile is gravel rest is asphalt. AND they now even have those nice big blue tourist signs point to turn there for Andy Meyers Lodge. It's like a 145 degree turn and we have definietly blew past it already. Turning around on 502 aint no fun!Heck, use google maps on satellite and rill right down to it. You can even use street level viewing to see the blue signs. Technology aint all bad."
1900962,2746,2013-06-26 21:07:00,3206,After the trip up 502 we are usually ready for a break in Dryden and top off our tanks after filling in I Falls. Saving 15 minutes is not worth it for me to pull my boat over the gravel.
1901290,Glenman12,2013-06-26 22:44:00,762,The road is called Ojibwa Dr..go to Google maps and zoom in on that area and that will make it easier...like has already been said it knocks about 20mins off..
1903018,kidsfishing,2013-06-27 14:10:00,12,Thanks. Will definately try it sometime. Now..........does anyone know a quicker way to get to hwy 72 north toward Sioux Lookout???
1903042,bigwalleye1,2013-06-27 14:17:00,2632,"Sure. At the end of 502, turn right continue straight thru town on that road, it'll bypass most of the lights and put you on 17 at the east end of town rather than turning left at the light and going through ALL of town.."
