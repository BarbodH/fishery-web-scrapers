1894961,Lund1875,2013-06-24 19:41:00,250,Is this the cabin that has the sauna on the island with it. A number of years ago I pulled up there to get out of a lightning storm. Headed for the first building we saw and the bees were not willing to share the sauna with us. Ended up taking cover in the cabin and would like to know who to get in contact with to be able to rent it out. Great fishing and lots of water to explore. Be sure to have the correct safety equipment as you will see the police typically in a week trip. And no alcohol is not on the safety list...
1896498,wiwalleyefreak,2013-06-25 11:26:00,25,Really appreciate all of the information...keep it coming. Also can someone commenton the required safety equipment mentioned in the last post. I think we are good...just don't wantto get caught unknowingly. Freak
1904154,wiwalleyefreak,2013-06-27 21:22:00,25,"Guys,The chat has slowed the last couple of days...appreciate the discussion it is good to hear about some of the places to fish as well.Thanks again for the information.Freak"
1904186,Troy Mansfield,2013-06-27 21:26:00,22,"For a safety kit you need a whistle, flashlight, floating rope 15M, bailing can. They sell a kit at Canadian tire that is a self contained kit. I'd buy one of those or see if your outfitter had one for you to borrow. I have several I keep on hand for guests"
1904634,Red Pine J,2013-06-28 06:27:00,44,"By all means, make it to the English River @ least once. I believe it was in 2009 ( my last time on Minnitaki )...Fathers Day Sunday. Our boat stopped to rest on a small point @ the English River. We were a couple hundred yards away from where the river dumps into the bay. Across from us were two anchored boats. Boat 1 had a family of four. Mom & Dad ( I suppose.lol ) & two young sons. We watched for a good 45 minutes as the two young boys caught fish after fish after fish. Just the young lads were fishin & ol' dad was the deck hand/ guide dude. Quite a sight for sure. Boat 2 had a lone angler aboard. "" Loan angler was also boating fish after fish after fish. Now granted, most of these fish were prolly eater size walleye, but, being that I met the lone angler the next day @ the Red Pine Bay area, some nice sized bass & walleye were caught @ the English!!!!!!! Lone angler had been @ Red Pine for a while & was keeping count of his catch. ( mostly walleye ) when we got there ( for shore lunch ) I believe he had caught about 50 walleye. His total neared triple digits by the time we neared the end of our lunch. ( lil over an hour maybe ). I remembered boat 2 & angler from the day before & struck up a detailed conversation about the day b4 @ English. He figured the catch on Fathes Day between Boats 1 & 2 was somewhere near 300 fish....and I BELIEVE IT....cause I saw a good part of the goings on. One of my boat partners described the fish being stacked in that ""hole"" like pickles in a jar & I suppose that would be a accurate assesment. Anyways, that's one of my many memories of time on Minnitaki. I have many many more & hope to make some new ones in 2014 with my grandson. Take care all & God Bless!!!!!!! Red Pine J"
1887601,wiwalleyefreak,2013-06-21 21:01:00,25,Does anyone have experience with Northumbrian Resort and has any one stayed in their outpost cabin on Minnitaki?
1890489,Red Pine J,2013-06-23 09:56:00,44,"However, I've been on Minnitaki many times & I would say say that you cannot go wrong on choosing Minnitaki to fish on. I can find out another local outfitters thoughts on Northumbrians reputation if you like freak. Red Pine J"
1891353,Red Pine J,2013-06-23 17:15:00,44,According to my local resort owner. I would trust his opine!!!! He also said that he had no idea about the cabin on Minnitaki. Good Luck!!!!!!!!!
1891505,wiwalleyefreak,2013-06-23 18:06:00,25,"Red Pine Thanks for the feedback. My experience with the resort has been great so far. I am interested in finding someone that has stayed at this outpost to learn if they have any recommendations on equipment we don't want to forget, fishing spots etc. Thanks again...really appreciate you taking the time. Freak"
1892249,Troy Mansfield,2013-06-23 22:55:00,22,"I've guided guys out of there and I can say the cabin is fairly nice, awesome location very protected area. Most people prolly have never seen it just because of its location in some islands between Taryns hump and Rice river sanctuary. The only thing missing was a dock. Other wise it's pretty cool spot. Some cool taxidermy work as well"
1893305,wiwalleyefreak,2013-06-24 11:26:00,25,Troy Great information...thanks for taking the time. Freak
1893657,rockape,2013-06-24 13:06:00,215,"I've stayed at Northumbrian a number of times. Greg is really cool and fair. We stayed in the big cabin at the main place near Sioux Lookout. Perfect for what we need. My friend stayed at the island cabin a long time ago, and liked it. It is in a great location for fishing Minnitaki. Great lake to fish."
1893977,Red Pine J,2013-06-24 14:42:00,44,"& I hope your trip gets all worked out. I've fished the Rice River many times. One of my most memorable days was spent @ Rice River. 2 boats of us ( 6 peeps ) caught many many walleyes that day. I might never get to fish Canada again with 3 or 4 of those folks..........so to me.....its a VERY VERY special memory. EH Troy, that Taryns hump is a new one to me. Near the Rice Eh??? Towards Pickerel Arm or up ( to me ) the other way??? Only hump I'm really aware of is the one near the opening into or coming out of Pickerel Arm. Fair weather & a nice Walleye chop to all! J"
1894753,Troy Mansfield,2013-06-24 19:03:00,22,Taryns hump is a hump that come up after you go through the chutes and your heading towards Harvey's narrows out in the middle of that big part of water. Comes up to 16 ft. Snags at the top and but move out a bit and you'll be pulling in big eyes and the occasional lake trout
1894857,Red Pine J,2013-06-24 19:24:00,44,Sure miss not being on Minnitaki this week. I suppose the fishin has been good lately. Sure hope everyone is on um!!! Maybe run into yall next year!!!!!!! j
