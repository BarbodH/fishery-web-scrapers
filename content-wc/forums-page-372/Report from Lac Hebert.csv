1482706,Guest,2012-09-04 07:00:00,0,Coming up thru Ottawa from #81 over Thousands Islands bridge. Is the best (fastest) way to Clova up through 309 North to St. Michel then the road to Parent/Clova or go through Maniwaki to La Verendre park and pick up the Clova road there. When looking at a map. it appears to be a shorter distance thru Maniwaki and the park but most folks recommend the 309 North route. Any opinions would be appreciated.

1897642,NY Walleye,2013-06-25 18:35:00,78,Any new reports of Lac Hebert? Heading up July 18th and can't wait.
1898498,octanehi5,2013-06-26 07:02:00,1104,"Leaveing in three days for Lac Hebert, ,This will be my tenth time on this lac,As far as fishing, outfitter and places to stay,You would be hard pressed to find a better spot in Quebec to fish. There are other places that have good fishing, but the camps and equipment are not up to par.This yr we have 10 guys in the north camps #25 & #26, 5 of which have never been on a float plane.With the very long cold spring the bite this yr should be fantastic for the first week in July. Giving that the first few weeks in June were slower than normal,because of the late spawn. I will give full report on my return"
1898754,TheDFP,2013-06-26 08:05:00,39,"We fished the Gouin from the 15-22nd. When we flew in, the crew getting off the plane said that fishing started off slow for them on Hebert. Last day he said 4 of them caught 325 and fishing really picked up. Did not see anybody back in Clova from Hebert when we landed back in Clova so I can't comment on how fishing was."
1899842,fosterthedog,2013-06-26 14:52:00,51,"Octane are you still in camp on July 6th were coming in that morning would like to hear how you made out, and whats working. We are going to be in cabin 23 but will probably head up your way when we get on the water. Care if we stop in if the boats are on the dock? We usually head straight to Gull Island to get a few before going searching for some bigger ones."
1901514,octanehi5,2013-06-27 05:58:00,1104,"Fosterthedog stop by anytime we will be there till the 7 th,we will have five boats even if we are fishing stop one of our boats and they will tell you were I am on the north side of the lake,will depend on which way the wind is blowing. just tell them your looking for Ron or stop by camp #26 Have a safe trip"
1902994,fosterthedog,2013-06-27 13:54:00,51,Thanks Ron see you there. Have a great trip leave a few for us. Steve
1903178,keek,2013-06-27 15:24:00,1003,Ron will be the one with his fishing rod doubled over. He knows the lake very well.
1223228,NNYorker,2010-07-28 18:25:00,11,"AW Chief,Sounds like we're from the same neck of the woods. I live in Adams Center just South of Watertown. A group of us are headed to Gouin in 10 days with Tamarac outfitters. Have fished the Gouin several times and also Hebert once. Fishing was great on Hebert, but we like the more remoteness of where we go on the Gouin."
1223232,AW Chief,2010-07-28 18:43:00,4,"NNYorker,I'm from Lowville, NY. I have been to Gouin before but has been many years and this will be my 1st trip to Lac Hebert. We are supposed to be staying at a new cabin they are building #26. Does Air Tamarac send any details of the trip like a welcome package. We just sent deposit but no word back yet. Good luck on your trip let me know how the fishing is?"
1223236,AW Chief,2010-07-28 18:55:00,4,"NNYorker,I will probably have some questions down the road on planning maybe I could pick your brain on some of them?"
1223363,octanehi5,2010-07-29 08:36:00,1104,"Hello A W Chief I have been staying at camp #25 right near the site of the new cabin,for four yrs its a great place because its 6 miles from the island and all the bulk of the people that go there, also you are closest to the deepest parts of the lake, are in the northern sec. of lac hebert.If you would like a detailed list of things to bring or not send me an E-mail at [email protected] I will give you all the info you will need. I know from experiance its very hard to make the 100-110 lbs weight limit on the plane. Hope this helps you Ciao Ron"
1223511,NNYorker,2010-07-29 16:26:00,11,"AW Chief,They should be sending you a package of information, but might not be until closer to your trip. It will have directions and what to bring. Tamarac is always at the Syracuse Outdoor Sportsman show in January so you could stop by and talk to them there as well. I'll post a report when I get back from this year's trip"
1227319,NY Walleye,2010-08-12 19:19:00,78,Any new updates on Herbert?
1290020,captwatk,2011-04-02 14:21:00,7,Two of us are driving from the Philadelphia area to Clova for a trip to Lake Hebert the last week of August into September 2011. We plan to stay at one of the cabins at the north end of the lake. Our last Canadian trip was in August 2008 to Lake Makokibatan in Ontario through Wilderness North. Walleye fishing was marginal Any advice on Lake Hebert and Air Tamarac will be most appreciated.
1313025,ma1819,2011-05-31 11:51:00,13,Any reports from this Spring (2011?)
1313078,vteye,2011-05-31 13:35:00,812,Many of the lodges in that area open around June 1st so could be a report soon.
1349438,ma1819,2011-09-13 20:04:00,13,"Fished Hebert late June 2011. Four of us caught over 400 walleye and more than 70 pike (not targeted) in a 4 day stay. Fishing, for us, was very weather dependent. Anytime there was cloud cover, the bite was on. We could catch 20-30 fish a a two hour stretch. During sunny times, we could catch fish but had to work at it. Jigging, trolling - all methods worked. White or chartruse jig heads with white or yellow tails and a piece of crawler or leech worked well. Trolling shad raps or thin fins also produced fish. Windy days were tough, as it was often hard to hold a course while trolling or stay over the fish when jigging, but a light chop produced a fish a cast. Any structure with 15-25 feet of water held fish. Our biggest walleye were 6.5 lbs and 5.5 lbs. Rumor had it that a 13 lb and 11 lb walleye were caught the same week. Accomidations were great, service was top and boats were all new. Couldn't ask for a better time. We also fished the Gouin for 4 days and while we caught fish (175 walleye and 30 pike) the weather was too sunny and warm for a real heavy bite. The only negitive is the cost - a bit steep when you include the provincial taxes. Still, had a great time and would do it again."
1210829,fosterthedog,2010-06-16 19:38:00,51,"A little late in posting but here we go. Got back Sat. 6/12 from a week of fishing with Air Tamarac at Lac Hebert with my uncle. I'm sorry I ever went! I'll never be happy fishing my home lakes and rivers again. Fish were caught any where on the lake from 7-35 ft. of water, fish holding structure abounds from rocky dropoffs to sandy flats, jigging /trolling worm spinners/ trolling- casting crankbaits it all worked. Jean and Eliane are great hosts, pilots and planes were top notch. The Island where the camps are located has a full time caretaker, cabins are clean, in good shape and fully equipped. The slot of 14-20 inches is great as is the 4 fish limit, the C&R licenses are free so my uncle and I bought one regular license and had one C&R allowing us to keep 4 fish from 14-20 inches for eating. 4 20"" walleye is more the enough for 2 guys. Most of the fish caugh were in the 16-22"" range. Big fish for me was 26"" my uncle 24 1/2"", one the guys in the cabin next door had a 29"". One of the people our cabin the week prior to us a 31 1/2"". This is a great numbers lake( 50-150 a day depending hours you want to put in) as well as the chance to catch trophy class walleye(if your lucky). Bright colors ruled in all lure selection Northland Pink/White Gumballs ruled with firetiger and chartruse right behind. 1/4 oz. jigs on calm days, 3/8oz. for windy conditions. The largest jigs I had were 1/4 oz. still caught fish on the windy days just couldn't hold the bottom on the windy side of an island or drop off had to fish the side out of the wind probably missed a few bigger fish. Caught a few northerns but I think this is more of a walleye lake from a structure aspect( not alot of weedy bays). Boats are brand new last year Lunds WC 16 with 20 hp Evinrude 4 strokes. Most hazards are marked or apparent but go into new areas with caution. I live south of Syracuse NY and the trip was about 10-11 hours to Clova roads were good both ways. Drove up the day before and stayed at Auberge Clova keys for a room are gotten at the restraunt/bar/store(food,ice,beer,liquor) next to the train station. Prices in Quebec(in the larger towns not Clova or Parent) are cheaper than the other provicences I've fished( beer was $25 a case/ cigs $6.50) no Ontario Outdoors Card,no plane ticket to International Falls or Thunder Bay, no $100 dolars to get my rod carrier on the plane. Plus no problem with beer in the boat. If I lived in the midwest it would make sense to fish LOTW, Rainy Lake, and Vermillion but with great fishing this close I cant see going west any more. Not trying to rag Ontario in any way have had many great trips there. Getting through Ottawa can be a headache do yourself a favor stay south of the city and find the ferry boat on the west side of town to Masson the best $8 spent all week. As soon as we landed in Clove we rebooked the same week for next year as did the party in the cabin next to us(great bunch from Cornwall ON. who we look forward to partying with again next year). Have fished Gouin Res. before and found this lake much more to my liking. Any questions post on this thread or PM me. Wherever your going this year good luck and great fishing. Fosterthedog"
1210967,5 of Diamonds,2010-06-17 09:04:00,151,fosterthedog:Thanks for the report. I haven't been hearing too much from that area and appreciated reading your detailed post. Best.
1211136,fosterthedog,2010-06-17 20:14:00,51,The ferry to cross the Ottawa River is east not west of Ottawa. If you going north on 416 from the 401 get off at Bankfield Road(Rt 8) it turns into Mitch Owens Road(still Rt 8) going to the east. Follow until you come to Boundary Road(RT 42) take a left(north) and get on 417 toward Ottawa in about 10 miles youll see the exit for Rts.174/17 go east probably 15 miles or so to Cameron St. take a left the ferry is at the end of the street. After you cross the river stay on the same street until you come to Rt. 50 go east up to the exit for Rt 309 North to Mont Laurier. Its longer miles wise but the traffic in Ottawa is crazy sun up to sundown.
1211408,ed08walleye,2010-06-18 16:39:00,27,I'll second the thought about traffic in Ottawa. And you are correct about the ferry. Very well worth it it!
1212707,Wall1,2010-06-22 20:35:00,17,Hi- after reading this report- anyone interested in going to lake herbert this year - we have a small group going later in August that could take 2 more people- email if interestedW1
1219889,octanehi5,2010-07-16 18:30:00,1104,"I have fished this lac 3 yrs now,every yr the fishing gets better, the average size of the walleyes get bigger every year,the outfitter has been working on improvements every yr.I have fished many lacs in northern quebec you will have a hard time beating this lake. I came back 7/3/10 I am booked for 2011, I stay at camp 25 I like the solitude.If you are looking for a reasonably priced fly in trip to a #1 fishing lac in Quebec Look no more this is it. My advice if you are going to fish it now fish deep like it was fall. The water temps in late may were in the mid 70s by july 1 they were 59, the walleye think its fall they were the deepest I have ever caught in june 44-52' of water we caught walleyes in . nice beer batter dipped fried in hot oil, homemade tartar sauce, fried red potatoes & vidalias, and a few blues,an ashton cigar, sit on the dock and watch the satelights fly over head,If there is a heaven I was There CIAO"
1222047,virginian,2010-07-24 13:10:00,5,"Fished Lake Hebert for the third time this past June (june 25-2), and had a ball. Lots of big fish period! I plan to go again next june in the same slot...I have 2 people and looking for 2-4 more. Weather was cold why were there and it rained every day plus the rollers where big. New boats and motors kept us on the lake 12-15 hours a day every day. Two big fish were 27.5"" walleye and a 15 pound northern. Write back if there is a interest. Virginian"

Myself and 5 others will be heading to Lac Hebert 24-29 Jun 2011 and I guess staying at new cabin #26. Do you have any info on the new cabin? Road to Clova sounds better than described to me years back."
