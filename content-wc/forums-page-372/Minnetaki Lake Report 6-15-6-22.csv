Weather man called for thunderstorms a couple times but they never came. I've never seen such picky walleyes. My go to bait for 25 years has been a chartreuse twister tail with a minnow. They barely touched it. Nightcrawlers and leaches on bare hooks out fished us 3 to 1. We caught a few nice walleyes, the largest was 25"". Fished for Northerns a lot in the afternoon and caught a lot. Biggest was only 35"" but still had lots of fun. I'll never go to Ontario in June without crawlers again. Not glamorous fishing by any means, but VERY effective. Good Luck!"
1895426,Troy Mansfield,2013-06-24 23:26:00,22,The late ice out has def changed the bite from the normal bite for this time of year. And I also agree about having leeches and worms on board.
1898530,scar,2013-06-26 07:08:00,196,Just my 2 cents...........I have fished Minnitaki in June for the past 12 years. Go up with flats of crawlers every year and no other bait. We pay $53/flat at the Bait Box in Superior Wi. (about 600 crawlers) We fish same locations as everyone else and notice all use minnows. We catch as many or more then most. Crawlers just plain work for us and are less then 1/2 the price of minnows and easy to keep alive for the week.
