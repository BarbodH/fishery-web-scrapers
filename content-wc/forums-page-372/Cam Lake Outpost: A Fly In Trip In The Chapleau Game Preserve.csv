There's a short trail right behind the cabin leading to Little Missinaibi lake. As many of you know it's a large lake, well over 3600 acres and is incredibly beautiful. We also were able to fish Trump lake for lakers as well as Elbow lake. Both were great, lots of trout in Trump and a gigantic pike in Elbow. That pike was actually larger than anything I caught in the Attawapiskat earlier this spring.Numerous walleye in the 24-28"" range were caught. Husky jerks were lethal as were jigs as per usual. What wasn't usual was the success we had with a chunk of worm on a slow death hook pulled behind a small bouncer. We were there at the height of the mayfly hatch so it's not too surprising it was lethal. Warm mucky bays, reed points or reed banks adjacent to 6-12' of warmer mud bottomed water was key. The key component being a large number of fish were cruising these warmer muck bottomed areas foraging on nymphs.All in all a great trip with a TON of exploration in some truly beautiful country.If anyone's interested you can see my full report here complete with pic's and video clips.http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/f...howtopic=70331Cheers, Mike"
