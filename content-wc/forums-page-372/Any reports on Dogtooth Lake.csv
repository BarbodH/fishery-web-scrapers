1904674,brown1317,2013-06-28 06:54:00,74,We were there the first week of June. Everything was about 3 weeks behind due to the cold weather. We did have trouble catching eaters but the Walleyes we caught were big (25-32). Should be good fishing right now.
1904946,port1042,2013-06-28 08:17:00,509,There are a couple a places along Hwy 17 where it appears you could shore fish Dogtooth. Has anyone tried any of these? I like to get of the car here and there on the way to Perrault Falls and have not tried fishing Dogtooth. Any advice?
