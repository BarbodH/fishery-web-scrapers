We did fly-ins out of sioux lookout and our outfitter had a bunkhouse at his main lodge we stayed in the night before our flight. I think they only use it for their guests that are flying out the next day but you could contact John at Red Pine Lodge to see if you could stay? Who knows, revenue is revenue. It's nice and clean. No bedding etc so you have to have sleeping bags and pillows. So, may not work but has a nice view of water, a pool table etc. Was always a lot of fun the night before we flew in."

I have stayed at the Best Western which is fairly new and I have stayed at The Lamplighter which is clean and your gear will be okay and a little less $ than the Best Western.
