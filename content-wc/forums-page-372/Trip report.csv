This was my wives first trip to Ontario so we went back the GBC, I knew the cabin would meet her expectations, after a dozen trip's to camp I know my way around so I didn't want any surprises to ruin things for her. She went along with me. In the Lund outfitter with a 50 horse Yamaha when the Lac was calm, yes the Lac can be calm now and then!! We explored some new spots, visited some of the old spots. The fishing was pretty good for two of the days, fair for two more and one day of changing weather. We ate all the fresh walleye she wanted, one meal a day. The big wave days she would see me off and read, my walkies worked well for boat to cabin communication. She loved the view from our lakeside cabin, the eagle's, loons, fox, grouse and mom moose and her two calves we saw during our trip. She even said she would make a return trip....one day...maybe another 4 years?! Like most of you we love our trips North, and sharing our favorite places on Earth with friends and families is so important for us. Being able to share this with my wife made for a special trip indeed!"

What areas did you fish? What depths and bait/lures produced the best? How is the water level? Thirty days to go and counting down to our 10th year trip to Fisherman's Cove Resort on Lac Seul! Looking forward to it because it is always the highlight of my year! RBF

The only wilderness she likes is the concrete one. So, it's definitely a blessing when you can bring your wife on a fishing trip and she has a good time."
1904426,wallydave,2013-06-28 04:36:00,2151,Sawmill was producing 4-8 fow. Lunker and the nearby sunken sandbars were good too! The Wenasga rapids had some hot streaks too. It got too bumpy for my wife to try Iron Creek or Steamboat. Bear Creek worked too.Pink and bladed jigs were my go to jigs.Good luck on your trip!
