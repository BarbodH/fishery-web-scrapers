Tentatively we're planning October 15 through the 20th. Full moon is on the 19th. Thanks all!"
1898586,REG,2013-06-26 07:15:00,445,"Been fishing in Canada for many years and have never given any consideration to moon phase - even though in general, I guess I would prefer to fish Walleyes during a ""dark of the moon"" phase. My only rationale is that if it's really dark at night, there might be fewer Walleyes feeding while I'm sleeping.But I have no data - or even experience - to back that up.I'd be more concerned with the thermometer phase in late October. Have you fished that time frame before? (Asking because I honestly don't know much about it) Seems like you might have nice chilly fall weather - or you might just be really, really cold..."
1898842,Guest,2013-06-26 08:30:00,0,Bring a Toque and mitts and long undies and every thing else warm It can snow or be 60 above Be prepared to switch your game plan to PineFalls also Either the Red or Pinefalls will be on fire Only an hour drive over to Pinefalls if you want to try that on a non windy day Giver snoose bruce on the greenbacks

And if it isn't going, the Winnipeg River at Pine Falls is an hour away. The time in October you are choosing should be good. The Red for the biggest 'eyes, the Winnipeg for the most fish."
