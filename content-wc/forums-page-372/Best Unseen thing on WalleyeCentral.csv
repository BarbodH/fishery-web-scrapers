1896266,Babamel2,2013-06-25 10:09:00,414,The best thing I have not seen on Walleye Central is questions and reports on the condition of the 502. It must be in good shape
1896426,Terwalleye,2013-06-25 11:06:00,166,"And YES, as of this past Saturday it was in good shape."
1896522,JayM5209,2013-06-25 11:40:00,1050,"But the silence does not mean that the ghosts, gremlins and various other nefarious creatures aren't still hanging around just off those 6"" shoulders! The 502 did wash out and swallow a pickup truck on Tuesday, May 21, just about an hour after I passed over the same pavement."
1896978,wallydave,2013-06-25 14:24:00,2151,"We travelled the 502 June 15th and the 20th. Aside from the washout spot, refilled with gravel, no real problems with the road for us. True the shoulders are narrow, the biological speed bumps are something to be aware of. And the roadside photographers can be a problem too! Good luck and have a safe trip!"
1897082,HeHooksHimself,2013-06-25 14:46:00,725,Be careful of ticks when you stop to tinkle!
1897114,wallydave,2013-06-25 14:51:00,2151,Don't you mean to check your pulp??!!
1897242,jimmie,2013-06-25 15:32:00,123,How far up 502 is the regraveled spot please? Jimmie Heading up in the am but in daylight at least. Stopped going at night as I nearly ran into a huge moose butt!!! She liked my lighted advantage my truck gave her for at least another block. Thank goodnees I was going up hill and could slow down quickly!!
1898346,bigwalleye1,2013-06-26 06:05:00,2632,"I'd guess it's 10-15 klicks north of the turn off 11, bridging the whole road. Looks like a culvert failed and had to be replaced. Was pretty bumpy when we crossed 10 days ago, would be worth the effort to slow down."
1899282,Terwalleye,2013-06-26 11:01:00,166,"Speaking of Hwy 11, are they ever gonna finish that darn bridge. Past 4 years it has been one lane at some point. Talk about job security eh?"
1900674,fishinnut 3446,2013-06-26 20:16:00,638,"You telling me the bridge still is not done!?!?2011 the son and I went on a 2nd trip to the same place,but that time we took the 35' RV and let me tell you my a $$ was puckered going across.Does anyone take 71 to 17 into Vermillion bay or is it faster taking 502?My want to take a different route this year."
