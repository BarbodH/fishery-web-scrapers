Their reasoning for disallowing in their exact wording - a tour package must include eligible short-term accomodations and at least one service for an all inclusive price. A service means anything other than property (e.g., guide, interpreter, bus tour, air transportation, ski lessons, etc...) Evidently we didn't met the service requirement."
1905242,Muskie Bob,2013-06-28 09:47:00,45,"If your resort or camp included ""key words"" on your receipt, it should work fine. It is always best to ask the resort if your receipt will qualify for a tax refund when you are checking out. The resort should tell you what portion of the bill (the tax amount) that can be entered for the tax refund. The tax on gasoline does not qualify.I normally don't have any problems and don't expect any this year as I am staying at the same resort where I stayed last year. Of course, I will go over the bill and ask how much can be entered for tax refund.Good luck"
