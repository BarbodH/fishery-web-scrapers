I will be fishing the Taylor Island area and have never ventured to Senn.Headed up July 12th, will be my 20th trip to Lac Seul. Most of my trips have been to the Chamberlain area."

I will be up again in late July/early August and was also thinking about Senn Bay. Hope someone in the know responds. Mansfield, Beatie, Gosse you guys out there somewhere?"
1900354,rnnonmt,2013-06-26 18:32:00,992,Not sure how Sen Bay is in Mid July. But it wasn't bad 3rd week of June. We fished the road bed early mornings for walleye and did really well. Just be prepared to donate a lot of jigs to the fish gods. I'm still scratching my head how a person can snag and loose so many jigs while vertical jigging.
