1898818,Campcountry,2013-06-26 08:26:00,164,Never tried Impulse but I use Gulp all the time and it works for me. Trigger X also works for me.

1902282,PBsQuest,2013-06-27 09:29:00,49,I've been an avid PowerBait user but recently just bought TriggerX. IMO the jury is still out.
1904354,Guest,2013-06-28 00:13:00,0,Tried it out what a Joke. Just another thing Northland has copied and called there own. Soon as I went back to Gulp. It was fish on save your money.
