Does anyone know where some of these may be purchased? - maybe a link to store or something. I'm posting this here because I can't find them anywhere and thought maybe that color was sold in Canada. Thanks in advance. Martin Looyenga Mobridge, SD"
562534,Guest,2007-01-03 03:27:00,0,My local tackle store kept some under lock & key in back room & only sold them to his better customers earlier this summer? They must have been limited quantity?
