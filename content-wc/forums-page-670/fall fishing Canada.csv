We got on the water at sun-up, came in about 11am, ate a big lunch, some slept, etc. and then went back out at 4pm until just after dark. It was just to darn hot during midday and the fishing seemed to die way down anyway. Mid to late Sept seemed like it was always better fishing... Chuck"
562840,tincan,2007-01-17 04:32:00,2,As far as I am concerned you are looking at one of the best times of the year to go on a fishing trip. At least here on Lake of the Woods. Less traffic and believe me the fish are much much larger. I catch most of my big walleye and pike during the months of Aug and Sept and even later if one can handle it.
562519,2746,2007-01-01 21:34:00,3206,"A group of six of us has fished Eagle, Lac Seul and Gullrock twice a year for the past 12 years......all in the spring or mid summer. We want to try the fall this next season but some of the guys seem to think that would be mid to late August while I'm thinking more like mid September. When is the best time to find ""fall fishing"" in that part of Canada?"
562520,guidedfishing,2007-01-01 21:59:00,531,"One of my trips up is usually the 2nd week of September, have made that trip for about 5 years now. It is one of my favorite times. Temps are still pretty good, can be crisp in the morning, leaves just starting to turn. We seem to catch almost as many as in the spring but the size is a little better. An added plus is most folks are bear hunting instead of fishing by that time. good luck GF"
562528,2746,2007-01-02 17:08:00,3206,Thanks GF. I felt certain September would not be to late.
562530,toby,2007-01-02 19:53:00,49,September is definitely the best. We make an annual trip to Goose Bay on Lac Seul every year the last week of sept. Lots of big walleyes and few fisherman.
562539,rockpt,2007-01-03 14:33:00,589,"We've gone to LOTW the second week in Oct. for the last 8 years. Except for last fall when we got hit with a bad snowstorm for three days, the fishing is usually great and the weather overall isn't bad at all; daytime temps usually in 50s and nights in 30s. Fall fishing in NW Ontario is great."
562543,Guest,2007-01-03 19:45:00,0,Wife and I stay @ GB the 1st week of Sept. Curious... Where have the fish migrated to later in the month. Do you have to run very far to get into the quanity of quality fish? Generally the water temps are in the mid 60's and find fish the same locations that I catch em in June/July.
562563,toby,2007-01-04 20:50:00,49,55 degrees seems to be the magic number in late sept. and steamboat narrows is the hog trough.
562571,2746,2007-01-05 11:10:00,3206,"Toby, when you say 55 degrees is the magic number are you talking about the water temp your looking for?"
562573,Rat,2007-01-05 17:43:00,102,"If you are looking for a wall hanger, the later the better. October is not too late at all. You just have to dress for the weather."
562575,Guest,2007-01-05 18:57:00,0,"the bugs are usually gone by then too, an added plus."
