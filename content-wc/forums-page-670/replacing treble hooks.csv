562664,Guest,2007-01-10 12:58:00,0,"I caught a small pike on a husky jerk it was so tangled in the net it took me 10 minutes to get him out.My question is if I replace the treble hooks with single hooks will it affect the action of the lure? If not, what size hooks should I use? I'm going to replace all the trebs in my tackle box.Thanks in advance for the advice!!! Terry"
562671,phishfearme,2007-01-10 14:29:00,1242,"t-bird - boy did your story bring back bad memories. seems to me that treble hooks have no place in these wilderness lakes but you simply can't buy lures without them. we have either replaced trebles with singles (but you usually need a single hook with a special large eye so the hook can be split-ringed to the lure and will swing freely) or have cut off one or two of the three hooks on the treble and then pinched down the barb. does it detract from the lures action? for spoons i say no since you want the spoon to wobble erratically anyway and on lures like rapalas, i would say that it changes the action but not necesarilly detracts from it. the lip has much more to do with making the swimming action that the hooks. my other thought, we've stopped bringing landing nets years ago. one reason is what you mentioned and there's a few others. one, for large pike, the netting can cut into the fish's body and WILL remove the protective slime layer - not a good thing for the fish. second, there's some studys that show that bending a large fish is a net with it thrashing in the net can cause internal organ and bone damage to the fish. my personal view is that use of the landing cradle is the best option with hand landing (lifting with the jaw grip) a distant second (although holding a large fish up by it's jaw can also cause internal injuries). phish"
562680,lobo1,2007-01-11 01:00:00,734,"t-bird even here at home in michigan we take the front trebs off our stick baits - rarely do they help in landing a fish - at least do this and of coarse pinch the barbs. like phish said we replace as many baits as possible with big single hooks or at least cut the stick baits down to one treble (barbless) in the back. also - in almost total agreement - I say that hand landing big pike with the jaw grip is the number one choice and then the cradle as a second choice OR if you have a true trophy that you want to make sure you get the measurments on before you release it - then the cradle is awesome - I always take one but haven't seen the 50"" northern yet - so haven't used it!

562681,Jesse-WI,2007-01-11 01:23:00,534,"Action, most likely no; but some lures such as the husky jerk are neutral buoyant so weight of replacement hooks can impact the characteristics of some baits. You are also going to miss some fish since single hooks will not be situated correctly some times. We solved this problem by getting a net with rubber coated line, some replacement hooks and a set of small bolt cutters."
562682,Guest,2007-01-11 02:17:00,0,"Thanks for the feedback.I just cut off 2 hooks on all my trebs.We are looking into the fish cradle thing,the guy's I go with are old school macho types and will hand land a pike before getting the net,(they make it look so easy on t.v)needless to say we have plenty of tourneqets and bandages on each boat.The stories we all could tell about hooks and teeth and emergency room visits..... but that is another thread..Hmmmm Terry"
562691,jigman 2003,2007-01-11 08:56:00,981,"I do one of two things: 1. pinch the barbs down on all of the treble hooks. That is the best way to insure no change in action. It definitely helps with extraction of fish. 2. replace all trebles with new barbless trebles. The only place I've found them is www.staminainc.com The other thing I do to make sure I don't waste a lot of time on a pike is not use a net. I either land them by hand (works for fish up to 40"" or so), or use a boga grip type tool to land them."
562701,Guest,2007-01-11 15:38:00,0,Years ago my group takes a pair of pliers and pinches the barbs closed on all of our trebles. We rarely have lost a fish because we didn't have the barbs.
562723,Guest,2007-01-12 12:48:00,0,"Out of concern for the fish, and not worrying too much about a tangeled net, I cut one hook off of the back two trebles on our favorate lure (Bomber Long A). Only once can I say for sure that it cost us a fish. Unfortunately it was when my wife hooked a big northern. She fought it up to the boat and when it got close I saw that it was big (40+) and had just the last hook in the corner of its mouth. Just before I got the net to it, it turned its head the wrong way and off the hook she went. Because of that, my wife's record still stands at 38 inches and she reminds me of it just about every time we go for northerns."
