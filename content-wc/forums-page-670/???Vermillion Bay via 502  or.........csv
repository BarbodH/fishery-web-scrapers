What are the pros and cons of turning on the blacktop I see going NW to Eagle Lake and onto 17. Final destination Red Lake for flyin to Trout Lake so I'am not pulling my boat. Thanks, Fred"

This will take you through the Eagle Lake Reserve and join up to hwy. 594.......turn left there and about 6 miles to the village of Eagle river and then on to hwy 17."
562548,Hump,2007-01-04 08:54:00,578,We used to go on 502 and stay in Dryden. I now take #71 to #17 to Vermillion Bay. A little longer but alot less stress.

I've gone that way but it actually takes longer. If you take the 1st gravel north,(Steffens) off of 594 going west, it comes out at the village of Oxbow on hwy 17, and is the shortest strech of gravel, but a little washboarded at times. I generally use the 1 st road north (Grifths)after the cement bridge on 594, because it's the best trade off to me. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"

This is by far the best shortcut to Vermillion Bay, Red Lake etc off 502. Adams rd can be a bit of a washboard at times but it beats the alternatives by a good 15 to 30 minutes. Plus everytime we drive it I see deer."
