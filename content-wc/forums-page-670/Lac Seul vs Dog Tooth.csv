562763,dewyg,2007-01-14 10:15:00,1006,I agree! I'm not bragging!
562767,Guest,2007-01-14 11:59:00,0,"The thing is, this is an informational web board where people are asking for help, and the goal is to try and help. Your response of I know something good, but will not share is basically a rude response and shows the type of person you are. Have fun in life."
562777,dewyg,2007-01-14 18:01:00,1006,"Life is good and I'm always willing to assist others. But to give in detail the location of truly giant fish would be unwise, we are all not catch and release fisherman. The chances of everyone releasing a 30 plus inch walleye are great but not 100%. Again I repeat if you are ever in the kenora area I would be more than willing to take you fishing with me. My boat always ensures 100% release of trophy fish."

This is the most rediculous thing I've ever read on the internet. Actually, no... listen to this guy so I can keep catching 100+ fish a day in my boat there."
562801,Guest,2007-01-15 18:50:00,0,LOL I'm pretty sure that's what he meant.
562675,dewyg,2007-01-10 20:53:00,1006,Why would I enlighten you to this lake?
562676,Guest,2007-01-10 22:28:00,0,">Why would I enlighten you to this lake? So why did you even reply, just to brag?? This thread was someone asking an honest question, looking for honest answers. Myself, I'm looking for numbers for the kids. So Lac Seul will be seeing me this year."
562677,dewyg,2007-01-10 23:02:00,1006,"I stated the information so people would realize that there is quality fishing around the Kenora area. I do not need to brag about anything, I was just trying to state the information. Plus I will not ever give any of my fishing spots away, I found them."
562678,rather-be-fishin,2007-01-10 23:05:00,429,"You won't be disappointed with Lac Seul for not only numbers, but quality of fish as well for your kids. Every time I have gone, the fishing was awesome!!! My son joined me for the first time last summer and he hasn't fished much at all. Within 20 minutes of fishing and before I even got my line in the water he caught a 27.5"" walleye and a 28"" walleye without pinching the tails all within a 5 minute boat ride of our resort. He had no idea what nice fish theses were and thought the whole week was going to be like that. His girlfriend went with and had never caught a walleye before, only been fishin for pan fish. (She's a real city girl.) To watch her reel the eye's and northerns in and jump up and down with excitement was a highlight of the trip. So I know you and your kids will have a great time on Lac Seul! Only advice is to be sure to hire a guide the first day or two you are there. The only reason why I am asking about another lake (Dog Tooth or others) is that the others in the group are always interested in trying something new. As for me, I could go back to Lac Seul over and over and discover new and fantastic areas to fish. So to those of you out there that don't want to share your ""hot spots"" :secret: (probably LOTW) oh well......guess that's the way it is, but I love to share my ""fish stories"" and enjoy seeing others have the success and fun fishing can be. The reason I am asking is I don't want to waste my and the groups vacation on a lake that won't give us the memories and challenges to enjoy for a lifetime!! rather-be-fishin!!!!!!!! :-)"

562725,Guest,2007-01-12 14:03:00,0,"To answer your legitimate questions first by not much water I would guess Dogtooth/Kilvert combined provide roughly 9-10 thousand acres of water. Not much by big lake standards. Secondly, there has been a tremendous increase in pressure. Spots that once had no one on them will now have a couple of boats hit them. However, there is no need to fish a spot that has a boat on it. There is enough water to have a spot to yourself. But, the increase in boats has brought ruder fisherman that will creep in on you. Whereas, Lac seul has water GALORE to choose from! Lastly, in my experience on Dogtooth if you catch 12-15 fish in a day/per guy that is a great day. That means 30 fish in a boat per day if three guys are fishing. This IS NOT great fishing. But, ten of these fish will be 28""+. Now that is a great day, we have had many days where you catch 0-3 fish per guy. I have a buddy that went 1.5 days without catching a fish and the one he caught was a 32"". That MAKES a trip! Dogtooth resort is the only resort on lake. I don't want to say anything bad, but I would check into Canadain vacations. They rent a cabin on the point by Dogtooth Resort that is outstanding! No website, but this is where I stay! Also, Luther Village on the extreme south end will rent cabins. Great place if you want to spend most of your time in Kilvert. My advice would be to stay at Lac Seul if guys in your group want to catch fish and lots of them. For the Trophy Hunters go to Dogtooth!"
562726,rather-be-fishin,2007-01-12 15:55:00,429,"SM Walleye Thanks for the honest answer and good information on Dog Tooth. Sounds like there are lots of ""big"" fish there. It is very helpful. I think I will have the group go back to Lac Seul and look at doing a seperate trip to Dog Tooth in search of the ""trophy""! Happy fishin!!! :) rather-be-fishin"
562757,dewyg,2007-01-13 16:24:00,1006,It is not bragging if you have done it! Check out my album.
562613,rather-be-fishin,2007-01-07 17:30:00,429,:help: I am looking for information and recomendations on rating Lac Seul vs Dog Tooth Lake for walleye fishing. I have been to Lac Seul 3 times and it was awesome! Have seen some fishing shows on Dog Tooth and caught my interest. Would appreciate any comments on fishing walleyes at Dog Tooth Lake and resort recommendations. :thanks2: rather-be-fishin!
562616,dewyg,2007-01-07 20:47:00,1006,"I live in Kenora and have fished both lakes numerous times, they both produce a quality amount of fish. But if you stay at Dogtooth you also have the chance to fish LOTW, as well as the Winnipeg river system. I fish alot 175+ days a year and I would fish LOTW more if I could."
562625,tjsker,2007-01-08 00:12:00,301,Doesn't Dogtooth have more restrictive regs than Lac Seul? i.e. barbless hooks?
562628,Guest,2007-01-08 10:23:00,0,"Dog Tooth is the lake you should go to. The word is that Lac Seul Walleye Fishing is a thing of the past. Most of the Walleye have disappeared and Lac Seul fisherman will be lucky to catch their limits if they fish all day. Yeah, Dogtooth will be the hotspot."
562644,Guest,2007-01-09 17:17:00,0,"These are completely different lakes. Lac Seul is a numbers lake pure and simple. You can check any Lac Seul lodge big fish list and fish over 30"" are RARE! However, fish from 24-27 are frequent. If you want the chance at 100 fish days then go to Lac Seul. However, I have fished Dogtooth numerous times and you go there for one reason only; the opportunity to land a 30"" fish. Having fished for 25 years 20-24"" fish does not get my blood boiling. However, the chance for a true trophy DOES! You can fish a long time on Dogtooth without fish, but numbers is not why you are there. Every trip I have been on to Dogtooth has produced a 30"" fish with others in the 27-29"" range. In fact, my best day there produced twelve fish over 27"". Now that's a trip to remember! But, Dogtooth has seen a tremendous amount of pressure the last few years becasue of TV shows and there is not that much water! I will be back to both lake this year. I now combine both lakes into one longer trip. I have a website that includes all big fish there and some video of a 11.5 lbs and 14.2 lbs. Let me know if you want to see it and I will post site."
562650,rather-be-fishin,2007-01-09 21:57:00,429,"That's what I was looking for, comparisons....I'm with you on wanting to catch that 30"" plus eye.....I have caught 27.5 & 28s on LacSeul but haven't beat that....it is fun catching lots of 24-28""s though, don't get me wrong on that, but fishin for that huge one or more is what I want to have the chance to do. So by saying not much water on Dog Tooth are you limited on where to fish? Are there lots of other fishermen to compete with? Is it heavily fished? Do you mean you don't catch many eye's just Big one's? Can you access other lakes? How is the lake for hazzards compared to Lac Seul? Is there only one resort there? How are the accomodations at the resort? (Dog Tooth Resort) I am in charge of arranging the annual fishing trip for a group of 8-12 so if we make a change I need to be sure it will be a decent lake and the others won't be disappointed. They primarily want to fish eyes, but occassionally fish northerns and bass. Don't want to make a change if it is not worth it. If Lac Seul is the best, then I'm happy to go back there. So any info would be great so that I can make a good decision on where to go. Yes, I would like to see the pictures you have. rather-be-fishin"
562651,Pooch,2007-01-09 22:58:00,4619,"This reply really does not help you, but one of my fishing partners has a walleye hanging in his basement that came from Dogtooth when the roads were gravel. I don't know the year but he is sixty now and he was a kid when he caught it. His mount is a real pig. I'm thinking 12 or more pounds. To me that is a really large fish for that whole region. Back then it wasn't anything overly special. Just a nice fish. Pooch"
562655,dewyg,2007-01-10 07:45:00,1006,"There is a lake that I caugth a 27, 28 31 and a 34.5 inch all in two days of angling in. If I was going to take someone to only fish for 10 pound plus walleye this would be the body of water that I would fish. It is neither of these lakes."
