It was disappointing! It used to be a one stop shop for everything interesting in the outdoors. I get the feeling it's turning into a bunch of little shows instead of one large one. If that is the case, it really sucks!"
562845,Guest,2007-01-17 10:54:00,0,"The shows are becoming smaller and smaller. Every show we go to is showing this trend. All Canada shows are basically all booths with outfitters, not much else besides that. We use to do a bunch of shows in the past, now only do 2 due to there going down hill in every aspect. Can find better ways to spend our advertising budject."
562746,Guest,2007-01-13 09:02:00,0,"went thur night nobody there, half the outfitters not there. we'll my erie capt was there, paid took about ten min. to walk thru show"
562747,Guest,2007-01-13 09:36:00,0,"Freddie, Yes, Robbie was referring to Peter. I know Nick handles the All Canada show while Peter is at the Rosemont show."
562750,Guest,2007-01-13 10:56:00,0,"I wish Pete would work the All Canada Show with Nick I would like to see him. I just can't bring myself to pay $8.00 for parking and then walk a half mile. I think that eventually they'll all move to Pheasant Run it has to be cheaper for them and everyone going is looking for Canadian spots and not glass cleaner, sun glasses and vegetable choppers."
562753,Guest,2007-01-13 12:25:00,0,"bored on Wednesday so I went to Rosemont. Show was pretty lame. less than 1/2 resorts and tackle shops than it used to have. unless big changes are made, I do not think show will be arund. One resort owner told me this is his last year. He said the internet is what is making these shows obsolete. A good website gets them more phone calls/bookings then the show."
562761,Guest,2007-01-13 23:53:00,0,"Went to the sports show today, booked 2 trips, one lake erie, one Minnesota. Still thinking about the deal Pete offered us. He will be doing all Canada next weekend in Milwaukee, but not the milw. sports show in March. Don't blame him, that's too far out!! Did any of you know Joe Michon?"
562768,Guest,2007-01-14 12:02:00,0,"Freddie, What happened to Joe Michon. He shared plenty of information with me. I know he had health problems during a fishing trip this past Sept."
562779,Guest,2007-01-14 19:10:00,0,Joe passed away a month or so back. My dad and a lot of the guys we went to Pete's with worked with him. I guess my dad forgot to tell me. I've got many of his marked up maps!!!
562786,Guest,2007-01-15 07:11:00,0,"Same here. Just last year he marked his three favorite spots on Bullock for me. One of which, he said is where he wanted his ashes spread."
562816,Guest,2007-01-16 15:55:00,0,"I had a booth at both shows because the rosemont show moved their dates. Pain in the butt. The pheasant run show cost twice as much to have a booth than the rosemont show, but it is a better show for canadian resorts. I only go to rosemont to book hunters. I did actually book quite a few fisherman at the rosemont show. In the end I gave about the same amount of literature out at both. The hours for us to sit there are much shorter and better at pheasant run. I have done both for 18 years. When I tried to get into rosemont there was a waiting list. over 600 canadian resorts there. Last year there was 64 and this year there was 28 resorts. The reason the resorts do not want to go to rosemont is the hours and the low attendance. Come and we will be there....... Same as the tackle people, boat dealers, etc."

562619,Guest,2007-01-07 22:16:00,0,"In one of the dumbest moves I have ever seen, All Canada and the Rosemont show are going to be on the same weekend. I think the new owners of the Rosemont Show have ruined it over the past few years, and I will be heading for the All Canada show instead. Where are you guys headed?"
562626,Guest,2007-01-08 04:04:00,0,the musky show at Harper College is this weekend too. Three on one weekend? DUH !!
562643,Guest,2007-01-09 14:55:00,0,the all canada show at pheasant run in st. charles.. im in line for my tickets as we speak.. who needs two??
562645,Larry S,2007-01-09 19:12:00,666,"Go to the Rosemont show if you want to see aluminum siding,learn how to dice onions, or find out about land for sale in Arkansas. Go to All Canada for Fishing!! Larry S"
562647,Guest,2007-01-09 19:49:00,0,"I'm thinking that the All-Canada show won't have lake Erie or Minnesota resorts, but never been to one."
562649,Sutsgold,2007-01-09 21:24:00,219,"Rosemont thursday, canada friday, and musky saturday. (wife gets a cropping weekend with the ladies because of it) Would be nice if they would split them all up, but getting your mind on fishing for a weekend is like taking a mental vacation."
562715,Guest,2007-01-12 08:51:00,0,"I tried going to the Rosemont show last night only to be told by the parking cashier at 6:50 p.m. they do not less people in after 7:00 p.m. and the show closes at 8:00 p.m. I guess I should have gone to Shoeless Joe's after the show. Fortunately, I saved the $11 parking fee and $8 admission. I'll be mailing my deposit check to our outfitter."
562716,Sutsgold,2007-01-12 09:45:00,219,"We did the rosemont last night. Was much smaller than in years past. Most notably, a lot of the musky displays were not there and the canadian outfitters were not out in full force. Like the last post said, it also closed at 8 which was odd. If you are going tonight there is a coupon in the suntimes that will give you free parking."
562719,ROBBY,2007-01-12 10:14:00,20,"DAVE, NEXT TIME GO TO PHEASANT RUN (ALLL CANADA SHOW) PETE HAD A BOOTH THERE AS WELL. NO CHARGE FOR PARKING. ROBBY"
