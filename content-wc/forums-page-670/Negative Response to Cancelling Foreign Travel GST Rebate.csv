Report critical of ending GST rebate for visitors SIMON TUCK From Tuesday's Globe and Mail OTTAWA Â— The federal government's decision last year to cancel its GST rebate program for tourists is a ""short-sighted"" move that will cost Ottawa millions of tax dollars and cause the loss of more than 5,000 Canadian jobs, a report says. The report, to be released today says the rebate program is a necessary part of the battle to attract tourists and to encourage those visitors to spend more while in Canada. Written by Peter Crowley, an Australian consultant whose specialties include tourism taxation, the report says Ottawa's decision last fall to cancel the rebate on the goods and services tax for tourists goes against a trend where governments are trying to find more ways to use fiscal policy to attract tourists. The tourism sector, particularly conventions and group visits, is price-sensitive, the report states. ""It is very likely, in fact, that the costs of the decision will substantially outweigh the purported benefits of the decision."" The program's cancellation will cause an estimated net loss of $46-million in tax revenue and eliminate 5,713 tourism sector jobs, Mr. Crowley concludes. The Harper government announced in late September that the GST rebate would be eliminated as of April 1 of this year, as part of a broader effort to cut spending and improve efficiency. The program, designed to encourage tourism by allowing foreigners to recoup the GST they pay while in the country, was inefficient and expensive to run, compared with the revenue it generated, said Eric Richer, a spokesman for Finance Minister Jim Flaherty. ""We were elected into power to be good fiscal managers."" But the Canada Revenue Agency says less than 3 per cent of foreign visitors -- 939,000 -- applied for the tourist rebate in one recent year. The government also says the cancellation will save $78.8-million and tourists don't choose their destinations based on sales tax rebates. Tourists spent $62.7-billion in Canada in 2005, with foreigners accounting for $17.5-billion of that, the report says. The tourism industry is responsible for an estimated 626,000 jobs.
