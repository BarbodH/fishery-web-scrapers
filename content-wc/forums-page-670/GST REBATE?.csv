562834,Guest,2007-01-16 21:30:00,0,"The GST has been changed. It has been lowered to 6% from 7%. However, there will be no GST rebates this year to the non-residents. Feel free to call the Canadian Taxation Department at 902-432-5608 and voice all your toughts and views."
562846,retire55,2007-01-17 12:14:00,1029,How many American fishermen will cancel their planned fishing trip to Canada because the GST rebate has been cancelled? The total GST I paid for last year's one week walleye trip to Canada was $31 Cdn.
562850,Guest,2007-01-17 12:50:00,0,"Here are some recent posts I have added on this topic. This should help you....NWO Fishing Bum GST is now 6% (was 7 until July 1 2006), and you use to get a 'Foreign Travel Rebate' on GST of 3% which the conservatives killed a few months ago (I believe it was in October). **You can still get the rebate for any travel in the upcoming year, IF AND ONLY IF you paid for your trip IN FULL before the date the change was announced (i.e., before that October 2006 date). If you only had a deposit down, you get nothing back, and of course the same holds true for anything into the future. If the conservatives stay in power another year (lets hope that's not the case), GST will likely go down to 5%, so you'll save another 1% of tax on your total trip cost, IF your trip is after July 1. Posted today in the Globe & Mail, Canada's best and only true national newspaper... Report critical of ending GST rebate for visitors SIMON TUCK From Tuesday's Globe and Mail OTTAWA Â— The federal government's decision last year to cancel its GST rebate program for tourists is a ""short-sighted"" move that will cost Ottawa millions of tax dollars and cause the loss of more than 5,000 Canadian jobs, a report says. The report, to be released today says the rebate program is a necessary part of the battle to attract tourists and to encourage those visitors to spend more while in Canada. Written by Peter Crowley, an Australian consultant whose specialties include tourism taxation, the report says Ottawa's decision last fall to cancel the rebate on the goods and services tax for tourists goes against a trend where governments are trying to find more ways to use fiscal policy to attract tourists. The tourism sector, particularly conventions and group visits, is price-sensitive, the report states. ""It is very likely, in fact, that the costs of the decision will substantially outweigh the purported benefits of the decision."" The program's cancellation will cause an estimated net loss of $46-million in tax revenue and eliminate 5,713 tourism sector jobs, Mr. Crowley concludes. The Harper government announced in late September that the GST rebate would be eliminated as of April 1 of this year, as part of a broader effort to cut spending and improve efficiency. The program, designed to encourage tourism by allowing foreigners to recoup the GST they pay while in the country, was inefficient and expensive to run, compared with the revenue it generated, said Eric Richer, a spokesman for Finance Minister Jim Flaherty. ""We were elected into power to be good fiscal managers."" But the Canada Revenue Agency says less than 3 per cent of foreign visitors -- 939,000 -- applied for the tourist rebate in one recent year. The government also says the cancellation will save $78.8-million and tourists don't choose their destinations based on sales tax rebates. Tourists spent $62.7-billion in Canada in 2005, with foreigners accounting for $17.5-billion of that, the report says. The tourism industry is responsible for an estimated 626,000 jobs."

Your cost may have been only $31.00 but my customers have to pay an additonal $179.00. since most have been booked for 6 months under the old rules, they will not pay it so guess who will? This is a disater for lodge owners like us who won't be able to recoup the money. I can understand the customers point. They booked at cetain price and we must deleiver the trip for the price quoted and confirmed. There is no changing. This will take about $20,000 off of our gross. Horrible and perhaps devastating."
562857,retire55,2007-01-17 15:00:00,1029,"Diaster: I'm responding to better understand your claim. I'm not quite sure how your clients are on the hook for $179. Client accommodation charges would need to be about $3000 to warrant $179 GST. Would you mind elaborating please. I have perused the Finance Department's website on this subject and I have concluded that your clients may still be able to obtain the GST rebate - see the second sentence of the text copied below from http://www.fin.gc.ca/drleg/06-049_1e...edule#Schedule ""The Visitor Rebate Program is proposed to be eliminated effective April 1, 2007, as part of the package of specific spending restraint measures announced by the Government on September 25, 2006. Under the proposed amendments, if a written agreement for a supply to which GST relief applies was entered into prior to Announcement Date, the relief would generally continue to be available (as described below) to recognize the fact that contracts may have been negotiated based on the availability of that relief. In addition, the current one-year period to claim a rebate would continue to apply. The proposed amendments would apply as follows: * Non-residents would no longer be eligible for a rebate of GST in respect of accommodation (including campsite fees) after March 31, 2007, unless it is part of a continuous accommodation at the same facility starting before April 1, 2007. * This GST rebate would continue to be available in respect of accommodation purchased under a written agreement entered into before Announcement Date if the first night of continuous accommodation at the same facility starts before April 1, 2009."""
562858,Guest,2007-01-17 15:48:00,0,I think for some strange reason this lodge owner offers his guests a price that already has the GST rebate off and then he(the lodge owner) recoups the money after. If this is so then he will indeed lose out on the GST he used to get back....or charge more which he would not want to do. He got himself into this situation and it sucks but he will make this folly once i bet. AV
562861,Guest,2007-01-17 17:27:00,0,"Yeah Diaster, If I'm understanding correctly what I THINK you're trying to say, then it's your own fault. Had individual guests been applying to recoup costs, you would be fine, just the program would have ceased for them. BUT, if they negotiated a written contract for service which included an after-the-fact rebate which would lower their price, you can still get the rebate in the upcoming year, and modify your prices accordingly for the following year. If you just quoted a price that included all taxes, BUT haven't collected, AND don't have a formal agreement, AND your procedure was to recoup all the rebate money back to yourself after the fact, THEN you have made a horrible blunder!

562863,Guest,2007-01-17 19:10:00,0,"If you paid a deposit of at least 25%, the resorts could rebate 1/2 the GST back to you on your bill. They had to show charging the full GST amount, then could rebate 1/2 back to your bill. I believe that most places that did this, did it as a service & convenience for there clients and will make the changes and charge the full 6% on the bills now. Not really there fault that the goverment changed the system. If there price quoted was with tax that may be different, but if the price was without taxes, I'm sure they will adjust the taxes on the bill to how the rules are now."
