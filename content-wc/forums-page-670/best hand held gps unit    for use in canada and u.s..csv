562451,Guest,2006-12-27 21:14:00,0,"Wayne, I have a handheld Garmin GPS. I went to that end of Lac Seul for the first time last July. There are tons of dangerous structures right below the surface that I'm sure the best chips don't point out. I hired a good guide the first day and had him show me spots clear out to McKenzie Bay. I started my waypoints as I left the dock, left it on to travel to all the spots, marked each one, and turned it off when we returned to base camp. Needless to say as long as I stayed on the lines when I traveled after that, I was never lost nor did I hit any underwater structures. Lac Seul is huge with many hidden dangers just below the surface. The guide is better than any chip you could buy, especially if it's your first time up there. You will catch fish because the guide will know where the fish are currently biting, and you won't get lost. You'll have a blast. Remember to always carry extra batteries for the GPS. RIVRATZ"

I did it once too and was real uncomfortable with the looks the guide was giving me. Anyway, the Garmin Legend is not a bad unit, however, my brothers both had there's on in map mode while cruising up Pipestone Lake and the map was showing us on land. The map was about 100-200 yards off of reality. That may have just been the accuracy of the chip though. Good Luck Guide7"

Can also transfer it to my larger Garmin I also take along and have hooked to the battery. Much easier keeping and editing info. It sounds like there are a lot of good units out there but feel very strongly wheatever you use should be able to be hooked to your computer for transer of info. My unit does not have any mapping features but run it based on past tracks, waypoints and routs. Has kept me out of trouble and in fish most of the time. Is it spring yet? Happy New Year"
562581,Guest,2007-01-06 11:33:00,0,"I use the Garmin etrex legend as well, getting a crash course when I got lost in the woods. Obviously, it brought me back to the road. It does download on home computer, but screen is small and unit is a bit difficult to navigate."
562594,fire105,2007-01-06 21:15:00,40,"i bought a lowrance H2Oc last year and then a chip for onterio region. at no time at all did i feel that i was lost. it mark any obstructions with in a couple of feet. i feel confident enough even using the H2O at night,the lighted screen is very easy to use. over all in my opinion you either one of the lowrance H2O products will get you were you are going and back with no problems"
562640,Guest,2007-01-09 11:21:00,0,Which one of the units mentioned above is most user friendly? One that doesn't give you a headache trying to figure out how to use the thing.
562654,Catman59,2007-01-10 06:33:00,345,I like my Lowrance Expedition C .........
562730,515,2007-01-12 16:58:00,254,I bought a Garmin 60 csx last fall and find it to be a great unit. The large colour screen make quick recognition easy when glancing at unit and operating a vehicle. Lots of memory and mapping programs available.
