So...I must bring gas along from the states. How much can I bring without having to pay duty? I cannot seem to find anything online about this.. Thanks Steve"

562423,Guest,2006-12-24 14:26:00,0,"Last time I brought my boat over the border, I had three 6 gallon containers of gas in the back of my pickup and they did not say anything or seem to care much. Gas they could care less...beer? Now there is where they get strict. If you truly have a concern, call the border station. Do not simply rely on this site, as you can get 10 different answers."
562424,Guest,2006-12-24 15:25:00,0,I make about 5 trips up to Ontario per year for fishing and always take some extra gas. Since 9-11 they have never asked if we had extra gas. Before that they would ask about a third of the time. It depends on the guard that you get--in my opinion. We never worry about it just pay if they ask and now with the small diff. of the two currencies we buy more in Canada closer to the lake and it is some safer not having all that extra gas on board.
562425,PJM,2006-12-25 01:04:00,3516,VMS What motor are you running that requires that fuel?
562426,Guest,2006-12-25 08:15:00,0,Premium fuel in Canada is 91 Octane. Very available anywhere. http://www.fasgas.ca/page37.html
562429,Guest,2006-12-25 14:41:00,0,"I take my Nitro 896DC topped off with 45 gals of 92+octane across the Intl Falls/Ft. Francis each year. The truck is topped off with 35 gals of 89 octane, and I also carry 6 gals in a can, just in case. Never had a problem or had to pay duty, even though I always get asked. Now, getting gas at the marina where we end up on the water is a problem, because they only carry 87 octane. I always carry a half-dozen bottles of Nitro Octane boost... it works great! Chuck"
562444,VMS,2006-12-27 10:47:00,1103,"I have a 90hp Yamaha 2 stroke that has a head made by Hydrotec marine. When I installed the head, they stated due to the smaller compression chamber, 90 octane or better must be used to prevent detonation. Nowhere in Manitoba, or western Ontario do they carry 94 RON to keep me safe, so I must bring my gas. (I am always testing my motor to see just how much I can get out of it. Hydrotec marine has helped me with a couple of things. ) Steve"
