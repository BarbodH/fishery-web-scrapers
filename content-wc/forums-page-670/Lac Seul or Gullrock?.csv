We go to a smaller lake, get 5 or 6 trout and cook them up. For us it's the socializing but for someone who pays big bucks for fishing, it will disappoint you, that said if you spend some money on a guide, maybe they can put you on fish. However, after 20 years fishing the West End of Eagle I know as many if not more spots than some of the guides and still have trouble filling a limit of walleye on opening week (notice I didn't say weekend)."
562338,Guest,2006-12-17 14:50:00,0,planning a fishing trip for the 3 week in june this summer. Love catching big pike and walleyes. Which would be better or anything else in the same distance from Int. Falls better? Like to hear favorite resorts to stay too?
562340,Guest,2006-12-17 16:39:00,0,"I can tell you that Seul is great, but chances of getting 3rd week of June, is slim to nil, especially at the better places. Regardless of your decision on location, if you are set on that peak period, I would suggest you start contacting places very quickly!!! NWO Fishing Bum"
562341,Guest,2006-12-17 16:58:00,0,"I stayed on gullrock for 18 years, now go to Lac Seul. E-mail me if you would like my opinion and comments. [email protected]"
562685,Guest,2007-01-11 05:47:00,0,"Lac Seul has always been one if not my favorite trip north. Have stayed with Brenda and Ken at Lac Seul Outposts for a few years now, very friendly and comfortable cabins and staff. Always will help you out in locating fish which has never been a problem. We tend to catch a few nice pike by mistake while walleye fishing. The walleyes are not giant but certainly plentiful. I would look into the Outpost fast if your trying to get in during June, fills real early."
562718,Guest,2007-01-12 09:50:00,0,"Nice post Ken, Nobody else would make a statement like that other than Ken or Brenda. While the fishing is good there the Service and attitude towards customers is pathetic. The last time I went Ken was piloting our boat back to the dock to go home. As we approached the dock and could see the new arrivals waiting Ken said ""There's another group of SUCKERS for me to fleece like sheep"" That explains his Customer Service Attitude."

562781,Guest,2007-01-14 22:13:00,0,Have fished Eagle the last three years and it has been great for walleye and northern. I would recomend it to anyone. We stay at the South Shore Lodge. Gordon and his wife do a great job of making you feel welcome.
562783,Guest,2007-01-14 23:27:00,0,"I would be very cautious about messages recommending Eagle Lake. I fished Eagle for many years and have never seen a more beautiful and diverse lake. It was the first Canadian lake I fished and if I had my way, I would still be going there every year. However, I finally gave up on it after two full years of virtually catching nothing during an entire week stay. This followed a steady decline in the number of fish over a period of years. Unfortunately, Eagle is a great example of too many camps with no ethical approach to sustained fishing. Limit after limit after limit of walleyes were removed; night fishing was prevalent for many years. Busloads (literally) of fishermen and women came in from Illnois and Wisconsin and the population of fish was decimated. Now, the camps are loading their clients up and putting them on Lac Seul because they cannot find fish on Eagle. Even the small ""outlakes"" reserved for the various camps were decimated, since the clients could no longer find decent fishing on Eagle. All due respect to those who catch fish on Eagle...maybe you know something that I was unable to learn. But frankly, though I am not on the PWT, I am not a rookie...and, I have selected a variety of other northern Ontario lakes after life on Eagle and have done just fine...both drive-in and fly-in, as well as boat-in accomodations. It just breaks my heart to see what has happened to Eagle, since I fear that other lakes have, or will, suffer the same fate. Go to Canada. Eat fish while you are there and enjoy. Don't bring them home. Buy a conservation license and observe the law. I want my grandson to have the same experiences I have enjoyed. By the way, I will be spending four weeks in Ontario next summer: Lac Seul, Pashkokogan, and Press Lake are my destinations. Practice Catch and Release!"
562803,scar,2007-01-15 19:21:00,196,"well said dr. hawkeye. i go to canada a couple times each year and am always asked how many fish can you bring home and when i tell them they laugh at me for going. i don't go because i like to kill fish, i go because i like to catch them! eat em while your there - they don't taste as good at home anyway! scar"
