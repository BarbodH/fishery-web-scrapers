562595,Guest,2007-01-06 21:30:00,0,"Let me tell you of my very very interesting experience crossing the border with a history of DUI conviction(s). My wife and I, her sister and husband, had been going to Canada for many years. We went for years and never had a problem. Never was asked for ID. or about DUI. Then 2 years ago we bought a new pickup and just had that little ""liscense applied for"" sticker in the rear window and no liscense plates on the vehicle. So we were asked for our ID. Each one of us gave them our drivers liscense. Mine came back with 2 DUI convictions, one in 1970 and one in 1975. For the record I quit drinking in 1977, and on Jan 19, 2007 will celebrate 30 years sobriety. Since quiting drinking in 1977 I have worked as a chemical dependency counselor for 20 years and a Social Worker for the last 5 years. I was at the time and still am currently employed as a county Social Worker provideing chemical dependency services to county residents. Upon seeing those 2 DUI convictions the Canadian Customs agent told me that I was banned for life from Canada and would have to turn around and go home. I thought after that many years it would not even be an issue. I tried to explain about quiting drinking, etc. She would not even listen and cut me off before I even got a sentence finished. Well, I asked my wife for the cell phone and was immediately the Customs agent asked ""what are you doing?"" I told her that we had been headed for Lac Suel and had a cabin rented, but that I was calling the resort to tell them we are denied entrance into Canada. I then told the Customs agent that the resort will be out a lot of $$$ because I sure wouldn't pay the full weeks rent for something I can't use now. Now remember she had just told me I had a life time ban and can never enter Canada. Ah ha, now all of a sudden she asks where we have a cabin rented and details of where the resort is, who owns it, etc. So then she says, ""well if you pay us $200, you can come in for the week"". Now all of a sudden it is ok for me to enter and drive around in Canada for a week. She never asked me if I still drink, or if I still drink or drive or not, etc. How come I can be banned for life, but if I give them $200 I can enter for the week ???? Made me feel like it was all really about the money, rather than genuinely trying to protect people on Canadian highways from Americans with a history of DUI. Why didn't they care if I still drank or not? For all they knew, I could still be drinking a case of beer everyday and driving drunk every day. But as long as they got the $200 it is ok to enter!!! Felt like extortion in a manner of speaking to me. Sure, they did not have to let me in at all, but why is it ok if I payed $$$??? I think that was the part that pissed me off. If they have a law that says I can't ever enter, well it is their country and I would just go home. Can't blame them for not wanting drunks on the roads. Either I am a danger on their roads or I am not, But how does giveing them $200 make the highways safer??? Well, if it was just me I would have politely told them I would turn around and not pay the $$$, but my wife as well as her sister and husband really wanted me to give them the $$$ so we could go for the week. So, I payed the money and went for the week. BUT, we have not been back since. Neither has her sister and husband. Yes, I was told I could apply for exemption if I do the paperwork and send it in with application fee and they would consider giving me an exemption so I can enter Canada. We have been fishing here in Minnesota since and spending our $$$ with our resorts here in Minnesota and will continue to support our own economy. I am sure it rerally makes no difference to anyone whether we ever go back to Canada or not. But I found the experience I had most enlightening about this whole DUI issue and crossing the border.

562600,Guest,2007-01-07 09:11:00,0,Canadians don't like drunk drivers and our laws reflect that. On your first offence here you get usually 1 years suspension plus an additional year with a vehicle breath sample interlock. Second offence is jail time and loss for up to life. Any injuries can result in a criminal charge with up to 10 years in jail. We want to know who is on our roads who has been charged before. These are our laws and if you don't like that's fine you always have the option of staying home. US laws are even more onerous for a lot of us Canadians who have even a small pot possesion.
562603,Guest,2007-01-07 11:17:00,0,"Dear Canadian Guy, this was my first offense and have so far had my license revoked for 6 months, paid 1,200.00 fine, gone to a 48 hour class for first time offenders(220.00), had a interlock device put on my vehicle(6 months)600.00, have SR22 insurance for 2 years(122.00 per month)paid 2,000.00 to my lawyer and have had to call my wife and have her come pick me up from the police station with my 4 year old daughter in the car wondering whats going on!!(I will never forget that night). I'm not a social drinker or someone who comes home and pops a beer to ""relax"" after a hard day.I don't what drunk drivers on the road either, I went out with my brother, who comes in town about twice a year, for the first time in 20 years.I made a stupid mistake that I won't let happen again!!My greatest joy in life after my family is fishing in ontario and I just want to try to make sure that if I need to fill out forms, send money,do what ever it takes, so that I might still have a chance to enjoy something I've been doing now for 28 years.Be careful not to judge someone you don't know. People make stupid decisions sometimes, we all must learn from our mistakes, I have......."
562606,Guest,2007-01-07 12:34:00,0,"Walli Hunter, Takes a man to admit he is wrong. After reading your post it seems you have paid a price...action and consequence. I hope you are able to get things straightened out and get your life back to normal as possible. Consider this a learning experiance it will definatly make you think twice! I hope you are able to get up here and enjoy everything Canada has to offer sometime in the future.. Good Luck to you and Happy New Year. A Canuck."
562742,Guest,2007-01-12 21:29:00,0,What do the custom officials check? DOT records or national crime records which are kept by the FBI? If it's the FBI records don't they only record confictions? If it's a deffered judgement it shouldn't show as a confiction.
562743,Guest,2007-01-12 21:38:00,0,"Your FBI number does not only shows convictions, it show arrests. If you are arrested and subsequently found not guilty, you need to try to obtain a quash order from a judge to have that record removed. There are only certain states, like Indiana, that will not show an arrest that has not gone to trial in your criminal history. If you are arrested in Illinois, and printed on the computer fingerprint machines, you will show the arrest within days on your FBI number. If you are inked it could take a few weeks to months for you to get into the system."
562758,MoWalleyeguy,2007-01-13 17:18:00,409,Last year at International Fall Crossing we had to stop and go in and get a child checked in (routine even if you have a note from the 1 parent who is not there)... anyways... there were 2 guys in th office that were being questioned and there told to leave. They were BOTH riding in separate cars and were both DUI offenders. I talked to them both a little while and they said they would call and have to get rides back home. One was 800 miles from home! So.... take your own risks guys! Think about your friends you are with also.
562765,Pauly,2007-01-14 11:27:00,10,"Can anyone give me the specific address, website, or phone number I can use to request the Rehabilitation Application? I am thinking it is best to have it when I get to the border instead of trying to get it done then."
562769,Guest,2007-01-14 12:05:00,0,You can call 1-800438-7020. The company is Canada Border Crossong and the web site is www.bordercrossing.ca.
562770,Dacotah Eye,2007-01-14 15:24:00,2722,Anyone know what type of regulations the US has for Canadians crossing the border with a DUI on their record? I haven't ever heard of any or had reason to find out.
562771,prov1900,2007-01-14 15:46:00,544,There is none. Take a look at what is coming in from the southern border of the USA. Same agency works both borders.
562772,Dacotah Eye,2007-01-14 16:12:00,2722,"I think the $200 (processing fee) was for a Minister's permit to enter Canada for the week. A permanent Certificate of Rehabilitation is $1,000. Those with offences more than ten years old may be admitted without paying the $200 fee under the new ""deemed rehabilitation"" clause. (Those with a more recent conviction may still be refused entry or be required to pay the procelling fee.)"

562776,Guest,2007-01-14 17:28:00,0,"Pretty much the same, you can be denied entry for any reason. I was once denied entry because I only had $50 in my wallet and no credit cards with me. I know a guy who served 10 days for unpaid traffic fines when he was a teenager,, he isnt allowed too cross the border because he was found to be in ""contempt of court"". He runs a multi-million dollar international business."
562780,Dacotah Eye,2007-01-14 19:23:00,2722,"I don't think the border between our countries is the one that needs this kind of bs. People come in from the south illegally and are welcomed with open arms. Then, I guess the reason that I can't check my oil is because all the dipsticks are in Washinton, DC. If ya ever want to make a mess of something, let the government do it. :cheers:"
562766,Guest,2007-01-14 11:44:00,0,"My honest answer is that I don't know what data bases they have access to. What I do know is that the officers that presented information to us, clearly indicated that they have the ability to access records that identify the presence of ""expunged"" records. The examples they cited and the answers they provided gave me the impression that this issue had been dealt with on a regular basis. Both senior officers reiterated similar language that gave me the idea that their office had been given a policy directive on how to deal with the issue. Mike Willems"
562558,Guest,2007-01-04 16:45:00,0,"I've read alot about the paper work needed to cross the border if you have had a dui in the states but I have a twist on this situation. I received a defered sentence.My lawyer told me it means it will not show on my record, but the department of transportation which is a completely seperate department does show it as a first offense.So what will appear when they run my plates at the border? Do they get info from D.O.T. or is it a international criminal check that the run? Would like to know now if I need to file paperwork before I crossing at international falls in june. Thanks!!"
562559,Guest,2007-01-04 17:44:00,0,"u better check up before trying to cross into canada. it depends on how long ago it was. from my understanding, 0-5 years ago. good luck. 5-10 years, up to the border agent your dealing with so mabey, 10 plus years, they'll let you in. be best to find out ahead of time so theres no hasstles at the border. if you can help it, international falls border is the worse. baudette still can be bad but yet better than the falls border crossing. pigion river also from my understanding is better than the falls border."
562560,Guest,2007-01-04 19:32:00,0,Hi. you know as many times as i have crossed at international falls or any other place up there no one has ever asked if i had a dui. maybe with the plates they might get something if you are the driver but as a passenger i have never seen them collect licenses so they could run a check yet. i would not worry about it as a passenger but just in case bring extra cash so you buy a plane ticket home. LOL
562567,jigman 2003,2007-01-05 08:03:00,981,"Last year when we crossed at Pigeon River we both needed to prove who we were. No problem, we had passports. From your passport they can get all the info. they need. I wouldn't take the chance, contact them and do it the right way so a trip doesn't get ruined."
562570,Guest,2007-01-05 11:03:00,0,"At a KDCA (Kenora District Camp owners Association)meeting last spring, we were given a presentation by the Senior customs officers from Ft. Frances. In their discussion, they indicated that they looked at ""deferred sentences"" and/or ""expunged records"" of DUI as grounds by which to refuse entry into Canada. All previous posts are in line with their information and recommendations. Especially if your offense is 0-5 years, I personally would not chance it. Call, take notes of the officers name you speak to, and heed their advice. Good luck, Mike Willems Silver Water Wheel Lodge"
562572,Guest,2007-01-05 14:48:00,0,We get asked every year...? We must LOOK like drinkers.....?
562574,Burr,2007-01-05 18:09:00,8612,"That's interesting Terry - I've never been asked - I've never had a DUI, but often the passenger with me has, or the other vehicles following - not once have we had anyone asked or turned back at the border. Many years ago, 10+ years ago, the company I work for assisted employees with the application to get clearance to cross the border after a DUI. The eventual conclusion we came to, yes, there was a permit to allow crossing the border after DUI, but it didn't make any difference. 2 years after applying we were still waiting, monitoring for an answer, an answer immigration was not ever required to give us. It could happen in theory, but it never actually did happen. No acceptance or a denial, the paperwork just stays in process, forever. Again, this was all of 10 years ago, probably closer to 13. Things may have changed since then - we quit trying. IMHO - I'd just try to cross, if I get turned back, we'll go fishing somewhere else. But then, I'm only 3 hours from the border. Don't use a vehicle that has been used in a DUI, don't use a driver that has been convicted of a DUI, move the person into a passenger seat (and not his vehicle!). Try to cross, don't ask, don't tell."
562582,Guest,2007-01-06 13:49:00,0,"I was kidding...it doesn't happen much anymore... But we used to get asked every time... back 10 years ago or so. Where we usually cross (north of Harlem, MT) they aren't very busy. I suppose they may be more thorough because of that?"
562583,guide7,2007-01-06 15:40:00,70,"I was turned back at Ft Frances about 10 years ago for a dui on my record in 1981. They just let you drive around their little customs building and aim your vehicle towards the USA and proceed straight ahead. While talking to them they did give me the ""Rehabilitation "" form to fill out and send in with $200.00 Canadian cash ($140 US at that time) to review and process. They send you a letter of ""Rehabilitation"" if they think your a nice guy. I was and now I don't worry when crossing. I just bring the letter along every time. The new rule, I believe, says 0-5 years needs review every time along with cash each time. 5-10 years is a one time processing fee. After 10 years you need no ""Rehab"" form. I believe it also depends how severe your US charge was(Misdemeanor, felony, etc.) in their processing review analysis. The whole deal took about 2-3 weeks to get back and peace of mind when i go north. Good Luck 7"
562586,Guest,2007-01-06 16:45:00,0,"Please take no offense to this question... Why Drink and Drive at all?? it is COMPLETELY avoidable... you dont HAVE to drive take a cab, bus, call a friend, spouse...anything but get behind the wheel! Not only could you kill yourself but someone else... then you be up on vehicular man-slaughter charges... think your gonna get in then? go through the process and see if you qualify for entry in Canada If not and you have been convicted etc... you could ask for a pardon to have it removed from your record? I have seen this DUI thing come up in the Canada forum more time then I can count... If you are drunk behind the wheel expect to loose alot more then your license.. certain priviledges are gone with it namely fishing in Canada. Again please dont assume I am flaming anyone as this is not my intent.. just expressing my opinion. PS. I wold have registered long ago but this site does not allow the use of webbased email accounts. A Canuck"
