562707,phishfearme,2007-01-11 17:37:00,1242,"jigman - i agree with you - we specifically pick lakes that are next to impossible to get into other than flying - the wilderness experience is a big part of the trip. most all the lakes we prefer though have a somewhat large river or two going thru them and as a result, we frequently see some canoers going through. these guys are definitly the hard core paddling type though and spend more time stroking that casting so it's no big deal. actually i think we with our noisy outboards bother them alot more that they bother us. i believe in quebec that there's so many old logging roads around that the vast majority of their lakes can be accessed by almost anyone and as a result they came up with the ""exclusive rights"" concept where an outfitter controls an entire region. maybe somebody else on this board knows more about this though and can add something. where you going this year? phish"
562712,twobearlake,2007-01-11 21:36:00,379,"Thanks for all the great advice. We are now in the ""negotiation phase"" of the trip planning in our household. I will post back later with our final plans. TwoBear"
562713,jigman 2003,2007-01-12 08:41:00,981,"phish-we're flying out of Ear Falls with Excellent Adventures. Going to Sumach Lake, hope it's good. I hate changing outfitters. Where you going?"
562724,phishfearme,2007-01-12 12:54:00,1242,"oh yah, i recall talking with you about farron and our trip to conifer lake with him. he's among the best outfitters around. ask him what it would cost for him to fly you to rainfall lake (or one of his other boat-cache only lakes - for a day. you'll have a blast but i'll bet sumach will keep you interested - and the chances of seeing anyone else besides your group is nil. tell him bob kerr from PA said hello although it's been a long time since we used him. in addition to conifer we went to brownstone with him. we're tentatively set for littleford lake with albany river outfitters out of pickle lake but we just lost one of our guys and are not sure what will transpire in the future. albany is charging us $850 for 10 days - one of the best deals around - it's cheaper than most due mainly to the short flights involved. have a great trip, phish"
562728,Guest,2007-01-12 16:33:00,0,"Hey twobearlake, If your looking for a reasonable fishing camp thats clean and affordable, try Wabaskang Lake. Give me a pm at [email protected] and I'll give you some ideas if your interested."
562789,jerry bark,2007-01-15 09:10:00,822,"lets remember that even Mc Doanalds and Wal-Mart still advertise. word of mouth is the best advertisement, but it is the exceptional bussiness that never needs to advertise. jerry"
562658,lenray,2007-01-10 09:48:00,467,Maybe give this a try. Ii just turned 62 so not a kid anymore. We are pork and beaners but try to buy as much as we can in Ontario. We fish on fly in lakes where there is just one cabin. But we go into the fly in lake by boat or canoe from a lower lake via a river system----over some very good rapids using a rope and pully system. Always a surprise to the big buck payers who are there via da plane.
562662,jigman 2003,2007-01-10 12:14:00,981,"Yeah, and a big surprise to the outfitters who are paying big money for EXCLUSIVE fishing rights to the lakes too. Especially when their customers complain and don't return."
562665,lenray,2007-01-10 13:04:00,467,Hello Jig We had fished this lake before it became a fly-in and we were also very surprised that folks were paying big bucks to get there. You have got me thinking about this issue. Should we stop going to a lake that we have been going to for years now that folks are paying big bucks to fly there.????
562668,phishfearme,2007-01-10 13:45:00,1242,"jigman - correct me if i'm wrong but in ontario these outfitters have a Land Use Permit (LUP) that does NOT give exclusive fishing/camping rights - only the permission to build and operate whatever the LUP allows. in quebec however, outfitters do indeed have exclusive rights to certain regions and you have to purchase the right to fish from them! i, like lenrays, have done lots of canoe trips thru many lakes with outfitters cabins or lodges on them and also have been to outfitters cabins where canoers, campers, etc. have come thru. when we camp we have to pay a cheap per night camp fee to ontario but nothing to the operator that has an LUP for a cabin/lodge on the lake. crown land in ontario is treated differnetly than crown land in quebec. phish"
562670,Raymundo,2007-01-10 14:26:00,9,"I guess an alternative would be the approach that 90% of us Qannaddian locals utilize...since most of us can't afford/would never consider flying in or renting a cabana. There's so much empty space N. outside of Thunder bay, for example, that most of us either camp with tents, or trailers. The logging road access is awesome. There's absolutely no crime problem whatsoever, my prospector pals from Minnesota come up here to get that FREEDOM feeling. If you're REALLY PARANOID....I got a nice spot for you to camp...right beside the MNR's FIRE ATTACK BASE...you can paddle down to the little island...catch wallys and 20 lb. pike.....60 miles N...literally 10's and 10's of fisherman-less lakes within a radius of 20 miles....you're 10x safer up here, trust me....."
562672,v-bay gord,2007-01-10 15:44:00,3168,"Steve.....all camps do some advertising, whether at sportshows, the internet etc. It all costs money. If there are camps that survive without any investments in advertising they are few and far between. I don't agree that because a camp advertises or attends a sportshow that there is something substandard about their operation. Just consider the users on this board who often change camps or destinations.......somehow those spots need to be filled. You can't always rely on others to do that for you. Maybe a different take on your premise could be ""if they are generating the money to spend on advertising then they must be doing something right"". Sportshows are just another adverstising tool...not an indication of failure."
562690,jigman 2003,2007-01-11 08:53:00,981,"My understanding from previous outfitters I've used in NW ON was that they leased the exclusive rights to fish the single cabin lakes upon which they had camps (exception would be for First Nation members). Perhaps that is not the case, but I have heard that from a number of outfitters in the past. These lakes were not part of a navigable river system (at least not in a boat, maybe a canoe with a lot of portaging), so maybe that makes it different. All I can tell you is that I would be very disappointed if I paid $1000+ for a week of fishing on a lake upon which I had been promised EXCLUSIVE fishing rights for a week. That is part of the allure of a remote fishing experience. Being alone (except the party you're with) on a vast expanse of water. Outfitters count on that fact when they are ""selling"" their experience. That's just MHO."
562693,Guest,2007-01-11 09:56:00,0,"Well...the Lodge owners are only telling you half the story. I can fish ANY of those lakes, but I can't use a motorized vehicle to access them. THAT'S the legal situation. Kearns Lake, for example. I can get to that lake with a canoe easy...Holinshead..go down the river with the rest of us locals... Believe me, with the uncountable lakes up here, the lodge owners don't have any monopoly on the good spots. We have so much good fishing, so easily accessed, we locals don't use the ""fly-ins"". ""Fly-Ins"" are for rich Yanquis...after shooting 13 fishing shows on video, 1/2 fly-ins out of Armstrong, ON, ...been there, done that."
562694,phishfearme,2007-01-11 11:29:00,1242,"jigman - i think those outfitters were promising you something they can't deliver. they CAN though promise you that there's no other commercial outfitter's cabin on the lake (if this is the case) and that there's no other commercial boat caches on the lake - (again if this is the case for the lake). i don't think there's anything the outfitter can do to stop people from coming into the lake - via canoe, plane, truck or whatever - and camping and fishing on crown land. (this is NOT the case in much of quebec though.) note is said ""commercial"" above. we went into a lake one year (springpole lake), the outfitter told us there was one other commercial outfitter cabin 15 miles down lake BUT we didn't ask him - and he didn't volunteer the small detail that there's a dozen or so private cabins on the lake. lesson - make sure you ask the right question. phish"
562700,jigman 2003,2007-01-11 14:29:00,981,"Alright, good to know. I'll accept that the info. I've been given is misleading. I will stick by my statement of being disappointed in a lake that gets accessed via anything but float plane. To get to most of the lakes I've frequented over the years would take one heck of an explorer, so I'm not too worried. However, I would not book with an outfitter again where I someone accessed the lake I was on. I suppose it's not the outfitter's fault, but I would be disappointed. No reason to pay a large amount of money for a body of water that can be accessed by others."
562634,Wallerian,2007-01-08 16:19:00,10,"Having four kids of my own, I'm kinda familiar with the ""drill"". Depending on the time of year, many camps have a family plan that might better fit your budget. I too recommend housekeeping. Age of the kids will also determine the facilities/activities you may want to have accessible. Generally, the places offering more non fishing activities i.e. beach, game room will cost more i.e. Sioux Narrows area. Fortunately my sons just wanted to fish. Unless you're bringing a boat, you probably won't be able to rent a boat that accomodates five persons. A ""drive to"" camp that has a town within a reasonable driving distance was a plus for our trips. If driving distance is a concern, look at some of the camps on Lk. of the Woods near Nestor Falls or Morson. Another area to consider is the Canadian side of Rainy Lk. Good luck. Ken"
562636,Guest,2007-01-08 21:23:00,0,"Another rule of thumb......if a camp owner is not getting repeat business, there is a reason for it. Bad camp, bad fishing, bad equip., bad attitude, bad experience, bad anything. Find out why and fix it, I bet it would cost alot less than what it costs to do the show. And the excuse that they want to stay in touch with thier customers is just that, an excuse. With email, you can stay in touch with your customers for nothing, touch 100's of customers at one time, all with a personal touch, and all at the push of a button."
562637,Guest,2007-01-09 01:23:00,0,"The question you need to answer...is this a family vacation or a fishing trip? Family vacation...you should probably find a body of water close to a town...Rainy Lake, Lake of Woods or even Wabigoon or Eagle if you want to go up by Dryden. If it's a fishing trip, I'd say head to Lac Seul, Gullrock or Wabaskang. You can find Family rates at most of these lakes for July and August...still will run you $1000.00 for the basics of cabin, 1 boat, motor and gas. The smaller lakes north and south of Highway 17 will probably cost a little less and often throw in some bait, but fishing will be ""harder"". Talk to the Mrs. and decide what kind of trip you're going on. Craig"
562638,Guest,2007-01-09 06:54:00,0,"Go online and start checking lodges that have family rates. You will see that in July and August, several resorts have ""Family Packages"" listed. Evergreen on Lac Seul, Ghost River, Lac Seul Golden Eagle, Lac Seul Fisheman's Cove, Gullrock Lake Golden Hook are just a few of the places off the top of my head that i have looked at that has these family reduced rates."
562641,Guest,2007-01-09 11:28:00,0,"Steve of Madison, I think its wrong to paint all lodge owners at shows with the same brush. The lodge i've been going to for over ten years was sold a few years back. The previous owner never went to shows. The new owners tried it last year for first time and said they made a lot of good contacts with other related businesses and got some good ideas from other lodge owners. They are usually over 90% booked each year but thought the shows could fill in the cracks. They got some quality bookings from the shows and are now getting referrals from those folks. An e-mail contact is not the same as gettting to see someone face to face. The wife and i went to one of the shows they attended just to say hi and they had quite a few other regular guests do the same."
562642,Guest,2007-01-09 12:43:00,0,"i agree with both steve from madison and fordman. an outfitter going to every show in every city is looking for alot of new customers. which means either there new in the buissness or run a so so buissness. but going to acouple shows to ""fill"" in some slots and to see some of there repeat guests i dont see any flaw in an outfitter doing that. i like doing my first steps in looking for an outitter via the internet to narrow down my choices then go to the show and meet them in person if they will be at a show in my area. plus i enjoy going to the shows just checking things out. ill be heading to the St. Paul show that starts this week."
562648,Guest,2007-01-09 19:54:00,0,"We always went to the show mainly to firm up our reservation and put down our deposit, and to take the owner out to a good German restaurant! He was always pretty booked before the show, but got most of his deposits at the show."
562652,Guest,2007-01-09 23:50:00,0,"Sorry if you think I am painting with a broad brush....unless the lodge owner needs additional bookings, or is a new owner, or just needs to spend $1000's on a vacation sitting at the show, they will not be there. All I am saying is that the camps with the best values in all PROBABILITY will NOT be at the show. And when I say $1000's believe it. Consider the time, travel expenses, booth costs, booth rental costs, brochure costs, and incidentals for a 3 or more day show, then multiply that by as many shows as they attend. A few years ago I was told that to even get booth space in the All-Canada Show, the organizers were requiring a minimum of a 3 city committment. That may have changed or not even true at the time, but consider the expenses involved. That's all I'm sayin."
562653,Guest,2007-01-10 01:35:00,0,"i understand your points but have my reasons to see my view that i listed out before that you can still find a good outfitter that is of quaility will be at a sportshow. ive been to alot of shows to form an opinion, reading alot of outfitters mentioned in other posts on this web site to relate to this topic. alot of people highly recommend certain outfitters for various reasons and yet ive seen ALOT (not all but ALOT) of these same outfitters at certain shows. if there so good, why are they still seen at shows??? my point is if someone is doing shows ALL year at various cities, yes, there looking for lots of customers and should mabey be hestitant to book with them and require further checking into and agree with you. but if your favorite outfitter does acouple selected cities i dont see them being as an un fit outfitter??? thats my view."
562656,jigman 2003,2007-01-10 08:18:00,981,"Lots of very good quality outfitters go to the shows. For some it is a business trip (i.e. tax deduction), for others it's a chance to get out of the bush for a few weeks, others go to see previous clients, etc., etc., etc. I will agree that if an outfitter has LOTS of openings (especially in June) then you better get some references. I will also agree that talking to people right here is a great way to narrow down your choices. Going to the show is fun, gets you out of the house during the dead of winter (can't even ice fish here) and gives you a reason to have a Blue or two. I can personally attest to the fact that MANY of the outfitters that get GREAT recommendations from this site will be at some or all of the All-Canada Shows. Just my .02"
562596,twobearlake,2007-01-06 22:20:00,379,"I am planning on going to the All-Canada Show tomorrow in Minneapolis. I was just wondering what you guys think about the prices on Canadian fishing trips. Am I missing something here? I would love to take the family fishing in Canada (wife and three sons), but I'm shocked at the prices! For five people it looks like it would range from $700 (for an outpost cabin) to several thousand dollars for a five day trip. That does not include transportation (driving from Stillwater, MN area), food, bait, etc. I guess I'll start saving now! Has anyone found a more reasonable option for a family fishing trip up north? Thanks, TwoBear"
562597,prov1900,2007-01-06 23:09:00,544,"If you have and RV, many resorts have the hookups/sewage/etc that you need. Or you could tent it at the resorts. Lots of them have showerhouses/bathrooms on the RV/Tent sites. That usually runs around 30-60 bucks a day. Some resorts dont charge for children under certain ages, i.e., 0 yrs up to 14. Check around. I know what you mean, it is pricey. It is also worth it. Check for seasonal rates as well. Spring and Fall usually run cheaper in a lot of places. Never hurts to call and haggle either. Good luck and post if you find something cheaper. Looking for the same deal myself."
562602,rpieske,2007-01-07 10:09:00,1276,"If you want a nice family friendly resort on Lake of the Woods, I recommend Canadian Haven Resort in Nestor Falls, Ontario. Lots of water toys available. The owners are friendly, have kids of their own and love to have families there. I have never heard of any complaints from folks who have stayed there. It should also meet your financial requirements. Here is their website:http://www.canadianhaven.com . I live across from the resort and have observed their operation for a long time. By the way, they have the nicest boats for rent in the area. But then you can read it all on the website."

562618,Guest,2007-01-07 21:29:00,0,"Hi. most places have a package plan of cabin, boat and motor. most cabins hold form 2 to whatever people. housekeeping is what you want, the american plan is for people that want everything done for them. places that still have outhouses and not inside plumming will be the cheapest. when i went to the show around chicago i would get a brochure from all the resorts except the fly inn places, those are the expensive trips. this way you can look through all the brochures at your leisure but make your reservation asap because they do fill up especially june and july. on your first trip at any lodge to be a very good cabin location. we found that the new people always get the wourse cabin location generally. but temper all that with the fact that generally you get what you pay for. the brochures always show the resort in the best light. remember though you are going up to fish will spend most of your time on the lake and not in the cabin. good luck we always had a lot of fun. let the kids clean the fish too and you take the pictures."
562621,Guest,2007-01-07 23:13:00,0,"For the first timer, I know going to the Show can be fun but reading through the brochures is both confusing and tedious. Rule of Thumb here...if they are at the show, they have space available. Most of the best value resorts will not be at the show. Why?.....Because they don't need too, they are already either booked or close to being booked for the next season already. The resort I go to did a couple of the shows some years ago, and his words are ""never again"". They spent $1000's of dollars to attract a few guests, his best advertisement is not a brochure that looks and says the same as everyone else, or some fancy website, but word of mouth, and recommendations from guest to others. The brochures and websites all tell you how clean and wonderful the cabins are, how great the fishing is, and how courteous the lodge owners and dock hands are, which we all know can be a LIE. Tell us what you are looking for, where you would like to go, and how much you want to spend, and you will get plenty of recommendations right here on Walleye Central."

562631,grt1,2007-01-08 12:14:00,259,"Well, let me comment on the last posting. I am not a camp owner so I have nothing to gain here but I know several in the Red Lake area who attend the sports shows, certainly there are those camps that need new customers every year because they cannot get return business for one reason or another, but there are camp owners who attend just to keep in touch with their customers and keep the personal touch going. many of them are already full but are looking for wait list customers or contacts for other aspects of their business. Wherever you chose to book your trip is always onerus and the feeling of ""gee, did I chose the right place"" always remains unanswered until you actually get to the camp and have the experience. From what I've read here on WC for the past 2 years, there are enough people out there to guide you to places that they have had the Experience at so you won't get snookered."
