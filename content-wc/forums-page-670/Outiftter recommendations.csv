562258,Guest,2006-12-08 16:01:00,0,Looking at possibly using Mattice. What lake should I chose for them for walleye numbers. Is the main lodge nice or should we use one of the outposts?
562260,rpieske,2006-12-09 10:46:00,1276,"If you want a quality outfitter with great equipment and superb cottages on productive waters, you need to take a serious look at Nestor Falls Fly-in. Dave and Michelle Beauschene run a first class operation. I can recommend them without reservation. Here is a link to their website:http://www.nestorfalls.com/ Drop me an email if you want additional information."
562265,jigman 2003,2006-12-11 08:09:00,981,"Hey Daveb-I've fished Pringle, Vick and Ogoki with Mattice Lake. All are great fisheries. I'd have to rank them in the following order for walleye numbers Ogoki Pringle (almost a tie for 1st) Vick (definitely last) For numbers of pike Vick (way out in first) Pringle (good overall size) Ogoki (few and far between, but when you see one they're nice) Other guys I've spoken with that have fished the single cabin lakes all report great fishing. There used to be a guy by the handle of ""Ogoki"". If you could find him he's fished almost every lake MLO has. I wouldn't hesitate to book any of their camps. Great outfitter. Better hurry though, I checked booking availability on their website the other day and they have limited openings at the single cabin lakes. Good luck, let me know what lake you book. I can mark up some maps for you on any of the three lakes if you'd like."
562623,Guest,2007-01-07 23:18:00,0,"Ive been using L & M Fly-Ins for years. Top Notch, worth checking them out. Im new to this web site, but wont try any other place for my fly in trips. I take my family to Otatakan every year and try a diffent lake each year with our ""guys"" trip. Going to Fawcett this year."
562635,Pooch,2007-01-08 17:51:00,4619,"Green Airways out of Red Lake have small camps on several lakes. Our group has been using them for years and we keep going back at least once a year. We also fish Lake Savant using Wildewood Fly-In camp. (You can also get in via a private trail on either your ATV or they will come out and get you.) To fish Lake Savant you have to stay at one of two camps on this very large lake. Both Wildewood and Green Air are good to deal with and have never disappointed us in any way. Both run about a grand for a week per person, with Green offering a family plan that is very fair. Pooch"
562646,Larry S,2007-01-09 19:19:00,666,"Try Northern Outposts at www. northernoutposts.ca excellent fishing for pike and walleye,cabins are nice,boats ans motors good check them out have gone there for 4 years Larry S"
562657,jigman 2003,2007-01-10 08:20:00,981,"Larry, I was originally scheduled to go with Northern Outposts but the trip fell apart. I hope to go with them in the future. Ryan seems to be a great guy and I hear nothing but good about him. Maybe I'll get to go with Mr. Walleye sometime in the future."
562667,lenray,2007-01-10 13:44:00,467,Jig if ya fly out of Pickle maybe we will see ya on da water.
562673,Larry S,2007-01-10 19:12:00,666,"Jigman, because several guys dropped out we won't be going to Northern Outposts this year. We have managed to book a trip{for 3} to North Caribou Lake June 16th to 23rd after this trip we are headed for 5 days to Onaman River Resort on Nipigon Lake Larry S"
562186,Larry S,2006-12-03 19:13:00,666,Mr Walleye I checked e-mail on this board and my regular e-mail have gotten no message. My e-mail address is [email protected] Would like to talk to you off the walleye central board Larry S
562188,Larry S,2006-12-04 09:01:00,666,"Jigman, Try Loonhaunt,Viking in Red Lake,also try Pickle Lake Outfitters-Pete Johnson's and Albany River in Pickle Lake Got Jeff's e-mail hope you find a good place Larry S"
562191,jigman 2003,2006-12-04 09:42:00,981,"Thanks Larry S., coming up with a new outfitter is a challenge. I've been very happy with Mattice Lake Outfitters, but trying new areas is kind of exciting too. I may still end up going with Mr. Walleye, but it's kind of up in the air right now."
562195,Guest,2006-12-04 13:24:00,0,If all else fails look at Arctic Watershed Outposts out of Nakina. Used them 10 times. An outfitter does not come any better thna Remi and Christine. www.awonakina.com. I have personaly marked maps of many of their lakes and can provide additional info. e-mail me at [email protected] if I can help.
562201,Larry S,2006-12-04 21:11:00,666,"Jigman, Here are several more places to checkout canadianflyinfishing.net,Showalters,and Chimo these are all out of Red Lake Larry S"

562205,JohnAB,2006-12-05 11:38:00,49,"Notice that you say Pickle Lake so would you consider either train or flyin from Savant Lake area? If so, I would consider Allanwater Bridge Lodge. Great walleye fishing, can boat 50 plus a day easily and my personal best is a 28.5 inch walleye. Also has good pike fishing. Via Rail stops right at the door darn near and John and Barney are very nice. I must admit I have never used their lodge but have dealt with them over the past few years and always find them cordial and willing to help out. My wife's family has a cabin on Star Island there, so that is how I know of their lodge and the fishing at Kawaweogama. Their website is www.allanwater.com."
562222,Guest,2006-12-06 15:33:00,0,"My group has used Showalters twice in the last three years and they've been great. http://www.fishshowalters.com/ At both camps there were well maintained 16' boats with new 9.9 motors. The facilities were will maintained and included a separate cooking building and two sleeping buildings, a refrig, freezer, pans, plates, and sliverware, and propane lighting. The fly-in is very well organized and in both cases they used two planes: one for some of our gear and the passengers, and another for beer and the bulk of the gear. Everything ran on schedule and the Showalters were great. I'd highly recommend them."
562245,Hammerhead Herb,2006-12-08 09:23:00,259,I can second the motion on Showalter's. We've been using them since the mid 80's and have always been satisfied with their service. Although you might find it difficult to get below $1000 per fisherman.
562246,jigman 2003,2006-12-08 10:05:00,981,"John, your suggestion is intriguing. I used to think about doing some trips via rail. Won't be this year, but maybe in the future. I would like to post that there are a LOT of week long trips out there to quality lakes for under $1000 (not much under, but under). I know because I've looked at literally dozens of places over the last week. If you do some research, talk to some guys (Walleye Central is fantastic for gettting info, great site), and talk to the outfitters you can put together a great trip for that amount. Obviously, for most of the places when you throw in food, gas, etc. you'll be over, but that's a given. There are some places (Mr. Walleye found one) that you can do the whole trip (food, gas, beer, outfitter,etc.) for a $1000."
562161,jigman 2003,2006-12-01 08:03:00,981,"Okay, looking for guys to make recommendations for quality fly-in camps out of either Pickle Lake, Red Lake, Armstrong, Perrault Falls, or Nestor Falls. Specifically, great 'eye fishing is of top priority, followed by good service and accommodations. Looking for people who would provide a personal reference for these places too. Thanks guys. Let the posts ensue. Wow, nobody? Come on guys. I've been going with Mattice Lake Outfitters for the last 6 or 7 years and am very happy with them. I'm just considering new possibilities. Want to keep the trip at $1000 a week or less."
562163,phishfearme,2006-12-01 10:05:00,1242,jigman - we've used albany river outfitters for two trips with them. see my trip report at:https://walleyecentral.com/dc/dcboard...2922&mode=full we're probablly gonn go back to bow lake this next summer but are considering littleford lake also. phish
562164,jigman 2003,2006-12-01 11:33:00,981,"Thanks phish. I did check out their website, sent them an email. Since very responses to my first question, how about this one? Anybody used Mattice Lake for Auger, Bellsmith, Guerin, and Pringle Lakes? I've been to Pringle, Vick, and Ogoki Res. and have been happy with them, but want a new lake. Looking for personal experiences on these lakes. Any takers?"
562165,Guest,2006-12-01 11:57:00,0,"Check this out. Short drive over the border at Fort Frances to the air base. Fly you in to the deep wilderness above Armstrong. It's a bit pricey but we found the fishing, quality and service to be well worth it. Have fun wherever you end up. Lunkwww.pfo.net"
562167,Guest,2006-12-01 16:16:00,0,I have been to Guerin. The lake itself was decent we did not get the numbers or size we were hoping for. The best fishing was on the portage lake. The outfitter was the best by far not even close. We will be going back with Big Hook this summer. The first repeat of an outfitter in the 7+ trips to canada.
562174,bugsy,2006-12-02 06:43:00,49,"Jig Man 2, Which of the B/Hk camps have you been to?"
562175,bugsy,2006-12-02 08:08:00,49,"jigman 2003, Unfortunately, to keep under $1000 for a week long fly-in, you'd now have to eliminate quite a few quality outfitters."
562176,Guest,2006-12-02 09:13:00,0,"My experience is limited to Chimo (chimolodge.com)out of Red Lake but I would recommend Roderick or Hornby. Both are less than $1,000. Roderick has lake trout, pike & walleye where Hornby is pike & walleye only. Roderick is about 20 min. flight from Red Lake and Chimo has several cabins there. Hornby is about 100 airmiles north and is the only cabin on the lake."
