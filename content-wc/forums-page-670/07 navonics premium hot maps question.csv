562828,scar,2007-01-16 19:27:00,196,i have the 06 map for canada and used it primarily for trips on lac seul last summer. it was fabulous! i am thinking about buying the new 07 version for a couple reasons: 1) i also fish minnitaki but it is not on the 06 card and i am hoping it is on the 07. how do i find out? 2 )they buy back their old cards and give you $75 towards a new one. new ones are $150 so i could get a new one for 1/2 price. does that mean though that i loose all of the personal data i added to the 06 card (fishing spots etc) is there a way to get the data from the 06 card to the 07 card? scar

The 07 chips have a ton of new lakes on them, including Minnitaki. On the website (navionics.com) they give you the updated lake info on the new chips. I think, correct me if I am wrong, but they are only giving $50 for the turn in. They are selling the old chips (06's) for $99. Not a bad deal either way. Once you have one of these, you will never go back. I think they are a necessity. As far as transferring data, you will be out of luck, unless you do it manually. Get the lat/longit data from your existing card, record it on paper, and transfer it to your new card. There are probably other ways to do it, but I am computer stupid. Minnitaki? I am fishing it for the first time this May, for the opener. Any advice? Colors? Baits? Don't need your hotspots by any means, but just looking for general info. I'll gladly trade Lac Seul (NW end) hotspots for some Minnitaki ones though."

Notice down in lower left you can enter a lake you would like to see on map. Guess what, they E-mailed me back and said they would notify me when Trout Lake was on it. Fred"

562844,Tweak,2007-01-17 09:50:00,685,"I doubt you actually have written any data on the Navionics Map Card. You probably are just talking about info, waypoints, routes, etc that have been stored in the unit itself. If that is the case it will be there no matter what map card you use. I feel writing anything on the map card is a bad idea. If you need storage, buy an extra MMC card just for that. If you did put your data on a map card I am not sure how to proceed. Navionics warns about putting the card in a pc. If its like any other memory card you should be able to browse the files you added on your pc and copy and paste them to a new blank MMC card. I have no experience with doing this on a map card. I have done it on a regular MMC card to share info to new units and friends."
