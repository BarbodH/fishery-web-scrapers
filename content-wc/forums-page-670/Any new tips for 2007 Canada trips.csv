562708,Guest,2007-01-11 18:30:00,0,"I figured the exchange rate AND the liter to gallons conversion. It was 4.89 U.S. Dollar in White River, Ontario. The Canucks would willingly sign over ALL their pay checks to Ottawa and Ottawa would give them a small stpiend to by some food to eat. Socialism sucks. If you like it so much you go live their. TAX AND TAX AND TAX some more Nobody is going to wee-wee on my leg and tell me it's raining. By the way, the fishing sucked and I won't be going back next year, I've seen better and more reasonably priced vacation opportunities in Bagdad, Iraq than Ontario. With the comfortable income I make I don't know how 80% of the people in Ontario live with the high prices and high Taxes on everything."
562709,Guest,2007-01-11 18:35:00,0,"Nope, My motor home cost 65,000 but in Canada the taxed price would 120,000. All of 3 people from Ontario came to the U.S.A. to buy a U.S. built motorhome because 95% of the people living in Ontario don't have the money because it was taxed away by Ottawa. ."

562579,phishfearme,2007-01-06 10:51:00,1242,"clem - some thoughts: $55 per case is quite abit too much. i can justify some handling fee but a case in the beer store is about $37 canadian - let's say $33US - so he's hitting you for a $22 per case handling fee. (one outfitter told me it's illegal for him to mark up alcohol since he's not licensed to do so.) it seems 20% for handling is reasonable. your trip costs seems quite high also even though in general ""you get what you pay for"". $1330 for 5 days (plus taxes) is about $300 per day - you better be getting top of the line everything at that price - or even american plan. the outfitter i'm using this year charges $725 for the base 5 day trip and $25 per day past that (but no food) which is pretty cheap but you can easily get a one week trip for $1000 but with no food. what is food worth to you - for us, not that much - we like to catch dinner! one other thing - we've been intentionally going to different lakes each year. it's proven to be enjoyable to have to work abit to figure out places and patterns - and as long as you do your research (ie: talk to people who've been there - don't just rely on the outfitter) there's not alot of risk in going to a dead lake. just some thoughts, phish"
562624,Guest,2007-01-08 00:08:00,0,I guess some local knucklehead had a laugh on us then about the beer store. When we wanted to spend money in Canada this guy jipped the local beer store out of some beer money. Thanks for the info tho.
562660,Guest,2007-01-10 11:53:00,0,"Big Tip of the TYear for Americans fishing in Canada: After hearing of the rape of 6 of my friends for 4.89 per gallon of gas in Canada when the price was 3.18 in St STE Marie, I filled 4 -6 gallon cans, replaced a 33 gallon with a 50 gallon gas tank on my motor home, and added another 12 gallon tank in my boat when I went there in Aug 2006. PRESTO.....no gas was bought in Canada. Darned if I'm going to pay for the Canadien's liberal social programs."
562661,jigman 2003,2007-01-10 12:11:00,981,"Yeah, God forbid you add to the economy of the place. Why should we help pay for fisheries, land management, roads, etc.? We should be able to go where ever we want and make them follow our rules because we're Americans. Come on. You are a foreigner visiting their country, you catch their fish, you use their roads, etc. and you are whining about paying for some gas?"
562663,Mohleye,2007-01-10 12:18:00,368,"As opposed to our government's subsidies directly to the oil companies, keeping our gas prices lower, so we can keep sending billions to people who hate us."
562674,Larry S,2007-01-10 19:17:00,666,All the Governments subsidies to the Oil Companies do is put billions of dollars in the Oil Companies pockets. Gas is around $2.60 where I live and heading up since the election has been over Larry S

562688,thunderatwork,2007-01-11 07:50:00,79,"Canuck,jigman, I was thinkung nearly the same thing. carry/purcahase 4- six gallon cans, take/buy a extra 12 gallon tank for boat, and change out the fuel tank in a motorhome, just to try to save a extra $90. less when you figure exchange rate and each can/tank didn't quite hold what the stated capacity is. No wonder some foreign countries don't like us."
562692,Dave Q,2007-01-11 09:36:00,1003,"Wohhh there k kid. i think you need to look at poverty, crime, health care in your country... compared to Canada before you knock social programs, not to mention the war on drugs, boy that works... more and cheaper drugs every year and i dont mean pot i mean hard drugs. sorry to rant, but its tough to hear/see non Canadians come here because our wildlife is in better shape and then bit** again sorry to vent"

562556,Guest,2007-01-04 15:55:00,0,Depends on where you go in Canada and if you coming from the states or not. Fuel in Sask. this past October was at least 30% more than in October 2003. The US/Canadian exchange rate difference the past 3 years alone is enough to make 15-20% Then multiply that on top of the 15-20% price increases.
562557,Guest,2007-01-04 16:28:00,0,right on larry. As long as I can scrape up the cash I will be going to Canada Walleye Fishing....No better deal on the face of the earth. 148 days and counting.
562561,phishfearme,2007-01-04 19:43:00,1242,"somebody was predicting last year that there would be 50% price increases almost across the board from outfitters but it seems the actual number is more like 5-10%. this poster seems to have dissappeared after the facts came out - even though he said he'd post an apology if proven wrong. all i know is i'll be doing my usual 10 day ""week"" at a fly-in house keeping cabin for $85 a day which includes cabin, boat, motor, gas, propane, etc. just try to find another vacation anywhere at that rate. sure you can pay $2000 for a week but you really don't have to - just look around abit. phish"
562564,Guest,2007-01-04 22:42:00,0,Sounds like a good deal phish. What outfitter do you use?
562565,phishfearme,2007-01-05 07:04:00,1242,"yah, it's a really good deal. albany river outfitters out of pickle lake. their lakes are only very short flights and they only charge $25 per day per person past their base rate of $725 for a 5 day trip. you can see my last trip report at:https://walleyecentral.com/dc/dcboard...ng_type=search phish"
562566,phishfearme,2007-01-05 07:12:00,1242,"here's one for you - we've been plagued by guys going to the two-holer at night to pee and then bringing in 1000 mosquitos with them when they return. as long as your cabin is sealed well, you can do the following: - when the evening's last drinks are poured, lite a 2-3 inch length of mosquito coil - get the mop bucket and place it right next to the door. - use it instead of the two-holer what's nice about this is that at the end of the trip, you, your clothes, the pots and pans and everything else in the cabin doesn't reek of mosquito coil since you no longer have to burn them all night. kind of a pain to have to dump the bucket but worth it! phish"
562568,Guest,2007-01-05 08:48:00,0,"Get yourself an ""Electric Fly Swatter"" for The cabin. You can empty your cabin of Skeeters in less than 10 min plus it helps to keep the unruly in line."

Exchange your $$ at the bank to purchase beer... the banks will give you a MUCH better rate then our Beer Stores will...(The Beer Stores MAKE money off the exchange of American Funds same applies to Tim Hortons etc...) A Canuck."
562578,clemento,2007-01-06 09:49:00,48,"How much should you pay for a case of beer? I had to pat $55(american) last year when I bought it from the outfitter. As long as I buy from him he does not count it against our weight limit. I feel like this is way to much. What does a case cost at the Beer store? I know a lot of outfitters will fly it in ahead of time so weight is not an issue. While talking about prices, I would like opinions on this price. Five day fly-in with all food(we do all cooking and cleaning). The cost is up to $1330. We fly out of Sioux Lookout and it is a 30 minute flight. I think this is a little pricey but have gone to this place for almost 30 years and the fishing is excellent. Worry about not doing as well as I am used to if I try somewhere else. Thanks for any comments."

We had some beer from the states and a good thing we did.
562542,jerry bark,2007-01-03 17:09:00,822,"elmo, my tip for canada: have your lodge/outfitter buy your beer for you so it is in the fridge and cold when you arrive. worked great for us this year, doubling the order for next... also: try canadian Heinz ketchup, its not the same as US ketchup. much better IMO. cheers jerry"
562546,Guest,2007-01-04 00:26:00,0,"yes canada does have alot of holidays to factor in. buying your beer through the outfitter works well, esp if your doing a fly in trip. alot of places will fly your beverages in before you arrive so its at the lake before you arrive. in turn that weight will not be counted against your allowed weight. might have to pay alitte more but worth the money."
562547,jigman 2003,2007-01-04 08:08:00,981,"From what I've seen, most outfitters charge what the beer stores charge. I have heard horror stories, but for the most part its the going rate."
562549,Guest,2007-01-04 11:17:00,0,Chimo does that for us. We pay the going rate in U.S. $ but they fly it in and take care of the empties.
562550,Guest,2007-01-04 12:01:00,0,If you bring twice as much money as you brought for the same trip when you did it 3 years ago...then keep in mind...it will NOT be enough. You'll still need more $$$.
562551,jigman 2003,2007-01-04 12:06:00,981,Twice as much as 3 years ago? Nope. Maybe 15-20% more.
562553,Guest,2007-01-04 12:15:00,0,"I agree with jigman. beer didnt go up twice?? i believe beer usually goes up a buck or 2 at most each year for a case. where it pry makes the differnce is the US dollar not as strong these days as afew years ago, so buying your beer with US money would take more than it did afew years ago. exchange rate mabey raised the beer the most, but the beer didnt raise twice as much. the outfitter i deal with mostly charges the going rate in US dollars to have the beer at the lake when we arrive. exchange rate, a whole new subject."
562554,River_eye,2007-01-04 14:31:00,1486,"Don't forget that your dollars aren't worth nearly as much as they were a few years ago, that's the main reason it seems like you're paying more."
562555,2746,2007-01-04 15:35:00,3206,"Yep, 65 cents US used to buy $1 of beer in Canada....Now it's $1 US to buy $1 Canada. It makes most things up there feel like they went up double but it's still worth it and, all in all, it's the best money I spend every year!"
