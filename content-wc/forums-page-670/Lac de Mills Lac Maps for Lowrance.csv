I go to Lac de Mills Lac every year with friends for a week, and this year I find myself with an LC111x-hd unit on my new rig. I was wondering if anyone had advice on a good map for this chain of lakes and bays that is on a chip for my lowrance. If there is not one, how about a good source of map data to create one with map create software? Any help would be greatly appreciated! Also, at one time I read a post about a good paper map source that I found on the web, but like a bone head, I didnt order it at that time, and now I cant find it. I think it was red maps?"
