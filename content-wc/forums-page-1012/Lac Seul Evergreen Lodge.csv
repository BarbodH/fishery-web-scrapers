Others in our party have fished the center part of the lake but are not familiar with this area. Presentations, depths, baits, fishing areas and anything else that will get us pointed in the right direction. Thank You."

He knows the lake extremely well, will put you on fish, and even he catches a fish once in awhile! Good choice, great place, great people!!"

Can be dangerous to lower units. Be careful. Take your time. Learn the lake. Nothing is marked. Cannot see big rocks just 6 inches under the water. Most fish caught on light jigs and leach and Spinner rigs. No need for bouncers to shallow. Used a bullet shapped slip sinker rigged 8' or so above spinner rig. Spinner rigs where tandem hook for crawlers. Great fishing, not my style. Like LOW better for my fishing pleasure, However, Lac Seul is an awesome fishery. Walleye where up to 7.5lbs. Many over 5. Have a great time and good luck.KM"
