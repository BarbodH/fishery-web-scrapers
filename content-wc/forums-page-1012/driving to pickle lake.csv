513306,Iowa Eye,2001-06-17 04:42:00,104,leaving Tuesday and driving to pickle lake for a fly in. I was wondering if it would be best to cross and International falls and take 502 to Dryden or cross at Thunderbay and go from there. How is 502? We will be crossing the border in the middle of the night and may need to get gas at one point after crossing befor we get to pickle lake. Any reccomendations?
513307,Fred_G,2001-06-17 11:55:00,908,We have always crossed at International Falls without problems. I think it's a little shorter than going through Thunder Bay. You'll want to gas up in International Falls. If you're crossing late at night the next spot you'll be able to get gas will be Sioux Lookout. The Wellington Inn in Sioux Lookout opens at 6 A.M. and has gas and a great restaraunt for breakfast. You can also get fishing licenses there if you need them. The only place to get gas between Siuox Lookout and Pickle Lake will require a 30 mile round trip detour to Savant Lake. If you fill up in Sioux Lookout you should be fine making the 150 miles to Pickle Lake.Sounds like you're fishing Lake St. Joseph. We'll be going back up there in August. Can't wait. Good Luck! Fred

We have been staying at Clyde and Merrils place and have loved the lake. Were there the second week in July. Have you heard anything about the water depth this year, I bet its up. Last year the water was up so high we could tie our boats to the fish cleaning shack. Good luck this year.Jerry"
513309,Fred_G,2001-06-19 09:03:00,908,"Hi Jerry! We have always stayed at the Old Post. John & Wendy have been great hosts. Lake St. Joe is a great lake to fish. I just wish I could be up there all summer.I haven't heard anything on water levels this year. I would think that they will still be up there. It was high last August when we were there and I was told that it went up even more after that. Guess they need to open the dam more. High levels will not be good for the weed growth either. Makes the big pike harder to find. Oh well, just part of the fun. Good Luck! Fred"
