513201,Guest,2001-06-21 02:51:00,0,You are right ..they do run every plate. I work in a lot of the small communities at times and when we worked in Fort Frances we stayed in the Falls. If you were in a new vehicle going across they knew it. I was interrogated on several occasions when I was in different vehicles.If the same vehicle went across they waved you through pretty much. Those customs boys take their job very serious over there untill they check you out.
513205,Guest,2001-06-22 11:16:00,0,"I have been following this discussion and decided to comment. I am a frequent Canadian fisherman. I have been checked fairly thoroughly at the border and basically just sit and smile because I know I am doing nor have done anything wrong. I have a friend that got a DWI back when it was not as big a deal. (about 18 years ago). He paid his dues, he has not touched a drink for 15 years and has paid immensely for his mindless act. I would hope there is some sort of statute of limitations on this. Because he got caught years ago, does that mean he will drive drunk? NO! The people who have a pattern and received more than one DUI deserve the fees. How many of you posting can honestly say that you have NEVER been too drunk to drive? For those of you that have never drank, I beleive you. Only you have the right to cast the stone. It takes very few drinks to be legally intoxicated. Whether it is a felony or not, the US takes this VERY seriously now too. Just try to afford it. No, I am not speaking from personal experience but do know of a few people who are struggling big time and they deserve it.Canada has much much more to lose from the tourism dollar from the people from the US than vice versa. Much of the economy is driven by the tourists from the US going fishing and hunting. That income will be lost if the extortion continues. I agree with never again that this is a little retarded. I suppose the $200 will make the offendor think that maybe he should not drink and drive....give me a break. Sounds like some stupid ""feel good"" politician dreamt this one up."
513195,Guest,2001-06-12 16:37:00,0,"Sorry man, I dont feel sorry for you. I respect Canada for doing it, and the US for doing the same on the other side. For every 100 that drive drunk, one seriously hurts someone. No matter how long ago it was, it makes you think before drinking and driving.You still got in, and you had the choice to turn around. Respect the countries laws, or like you said, dont go back. Sounds like you made your decision."
513196,Guest,2001-06-12 17:36:00,0,"Finn he paid his dues and he dosn't drink and drive anymore he has learned his lesson, how would you like to drive 15 hours and have this happen to you? It wasn't fun by any strech of the imagination!! Would you like to turn around and go home ?? As for what crossing it was pigion river mn. Like I said we are sad this had to happen and we feel it is nothing but extotion and we won't be back. Thank god for great fishing in minn, wis, and mich.!! By Canada forever"
513194,Hunter,2001-06-12 17:45:00,346,"Dont try it this fall, I would make a phone call if I were you. New laws came into effect the first of January, every owner of a firearm has to be registerred and by Jan1/2002 all firearms must be registerred. I believe you would now have to register your firearm, and be approved be the Gov't to bring it in! For probably close to $100. This is The Land of The Registerred and The Home of The Overtaxed!"
513197,Guest,2001-06-12 18:55:00,0,"Extortion...? How about us Canadians can not get into the U.S. at all with any kind of record. The only reason our border patrol is doing it is because you started it first. At least you did not have to turn back and were able to continue your trip. You should be happy we did not treat you like you treat us, you really would have been pissed then."
513198,Guest,2001-06-19 09:09:00,0,"We had three guys cross at Baudette. Two had DUI's and one didn't. The two had to pay or turn back. If you had money invested already, you almost have to pay the $200....."
513202,Newby,2001-06-19 09:57:00,148,"I think what it really boils down to is doing you homework before entering another country. If I had a record I would be sure to call immigration and find out the rules BEFORE I LEFT. You would know what you are going to face when you get to the border. Ok you paid you debt, but face the fact that it is considered a felony in Canada and taken very seriously. Would any of you Americans like to take a trip to Cuba? NO Because you know what you are up against before you leave!Just my 2 cents"
513203,Guest,2001-06-19 13:57:00,0,"Like I said before I have been going to canada for more than 25 years aand never heard of this!! Don't tell me I didn't do my home work! I know most of the rules and follow them completly!! My friend that had to pay has also been going to canada for along time and this never came up. I've been serched before never had a problem they are just doing their job, if you don't violate you haave nothing to hide! But when this happen that was bad! I don't care if the U.S. started first or not its nothing but extortion plain and simple, they know you won't ture around and go home when you drove all that ways. Its just bad politics on both sides if the U.S. does this also!! It sucks plain and simple!!! Ex-candian fisherman"
513204,Guest,2001-06-19 15:08:00,0,George W Bush had to apply for permission to enter Canada because he is a convicted criminal in our eyes. Our government rushed through the paperwork. A DWI is not like a speeding ticket in this country. If you are caught you lose your license on the spot. If you have a suspended license and get caught again the car is seized in a lot of areas and you do some time. The car is held for a period of up to six months and you pay all fees. It does not matter whose car it is.
513199,Guest,2001-06-20 01:51:00,0,"I've been going across the border for a long time. If they just come out and ask you and you say no, how do they know unless they actually run everyones ID's through their system? Typically, there are routine questions when you cross and most times they never verify anything unless you admit to having more than the limit allows to cross with, then you go in and pay the tax on it and you're on your way. We have a group going up and out of six I know that two have had DWI's in the past, however neither of them is driving. Unless I'm actually pulled to the side and checked and we are asked to produce ID's, why would we want to admit to it? I guess what I really want to know is whether this is now a routine question that every vehicle that crosses is asked? They can't possibly run every single license plate that comes to the border can they?"
513200,Guest,2001-06-20 17:47:00,0,"They probably can run every single plate, it does not take that long. I had a slight delay coming back into the U.S.A. this last weekend, the border guy was waiting on something coming back on his terminal. I am 99% sure it was my vehicle and driver info."
513184,Guest,2001-06-11 17:32:00,0,"Went to ontario last week an the guy driving had an old DWI pop up on his license plate when checked at the boarder!! They would not let us through until he payed a 200.00 dallor(candian) fee to do the paper work to ask permision to cross. This was a sunday so he could only get a temperary one and if he comes back again he will have to pay again!!! This DWI was over 13 years old, what a racket!!!! Its nothing but extortion!!!!!! The great country to the north can kiss our money goodby for ever!! I have been going to canada for more thaan 25 years and I never heard of this befour! They want to keep the american bad elament out of their country! Well if a 13 year old charge is a bad elament you know what they can do!! They said that a DWI is a felony in canada, well he payed his dues here why should he have to pay more to go there? Its not like we are young kids crossing the boarder, were mid fourties to early fifties. So if any of you guys have one on your record you better not drive, have someone with a clean record drive his vehical there. I love canada, we all do, but they sure try to discourage us from comming up there don't they. Well they have with us. We will not be back and thats to bad I feel bad about this but we will not take this extotion lightly. Good luck excandian fisherman"
513185,Fallsman,2001-06-12 02:03:00,93,"The same applies to us Canadians when crossing into the U.S.. In fact it is worse, they will refuse entry. This all came about when the U.S. implimented stricker boarder entrance procedures last year when they complained that the Canadians were too lax in allowing undesireables into Canada and who would subsequently make their way into the U.S.. The door swings both ways!"
513187,Guest,2001-06-12 02:35:00,0,"This has been discussed on this board before. We take DWIs very seriously here in Canada and rightfully so. It costs money to process applications and why should we the Canadian pulic pay for your application process.I agree with Fallsman........The USA has been pressuring Canada to tighten their borders up. We are merely making sure ""undesireables"" are not entering our fair country. We all know that DWIs are in a habit of repeating themselves."
513188,Hunter,2001-06-12 03:57:00,346,"This was posted much earlier about not taking someones vehicle who has been charged with an offence. Maybe they are trying to make up for all the tickets people from the states get and never pay! Come back, is this really worth losing great vacation destinations for. Now if you want a real tough time try and bring a firearm into the country."
513186,Guest,2001-06-12 04:14:00,0,yeah right! god forbid that an american citizen vacation in Canada and then try to come home. i'm sure thats the desired goal of having canada border control check for dwi's
513189,Byron,2001-06-12 04:35:00,42,"A question about DUI's.If I take my car, but someone else drives it across the border, and while in Canada, will I still have to pay?"
513191,Sprinter,2001-06-12 05:46:00,66,Not that it makes a difference but where did you cross into Canada? What border Crossing?Sprinter
513190,Hunter,2001-06-12 06:01:00,346,"When they run your plate, it shows up on the computer if the owner has any convictions against them. The idea is to take someones car who has never been charged with anything. The computer shows no charges, the customs officer doesnt have time to run everyones name, and it isnt usually a problem. I know several customs officers personally, these guys arent out to give Joe Blow a hard time, just cause he wants to go fishing. They have a Job to do, they dont like having to do it, but if that pops up on the computer they have to pull you over. I know for a fact most of them would let you go right through if they could. But this is still a International boarder crossing. And once you are across it is Canadian rules you have to play by, just like I follow the American when I cross. It is not the guy in the uniform, its the rediculous government, that a bunch of fools in Toronto elected for us. Come over, the Government might not want you here but the citizens do!"
513192,Hank,2001-06-12 16:04:00,9,"I have an 8 year old DUI and I have read these post about crossing the border for the past 2 years...Not knowing that it was a problem crossing til I read it here...I cross at least once a year and in my own vehicle and myself driving, and it has never been brought up...So this past year all these post about this subject had me worried, so I emailed the Ministry of Tourism in Ottawa about this and they politely sent a reply with numbers to call...As far as the government people in Ottawa care, there is no problem with a prior DUI as long as your debt to society is paid...Every person that I did talk to said that any DUI while I was in Canada would be a very big problem and this I have no problem believing...My DUI was in 1994...I have crossed the border at least once a year since and never a question asked...So I don't know what is going on with the others that claim this is happening to them..."
513193,Guest,2001-06-12 16:15:00,0,"I suspect that it has a lot to do with where you cross. We crossed in Montana last fall with a dog, 4 shotguns and a boat and were basicaly just waved through."
