513490,oldlogin,2001-06-22 10:56:00,22,"Issued: 2001.06.21LAC SEUL OUTFLOW INCREASED - ENGLISH RIVER LEVELS WILL RISEMany areas of the Winnipeg River drainage basin received significant rainfall over the past week - almost 100 mm or 4 inches in some locations. This additional rainfall will extend the unusually high water level and flow conditions throughout northwestern Ontario. Shoreline residents and those using the lakes and rivers should exercise caution due to the high water levels, river currents and floating debris. Any precautions possible should be taken to protect docks and other shoreline property. The current level of Lake of the Woods is 323.64 metres or 1061.8 ft. The level rose 2 cm (1.0 in) over the past week and is expected to rise 2 to 5 cm (1 to 2 in) over the next week. Lake of the Woods is currently at the highest level since 1950. Subject to further rain, the level could well reach 323.70 m (1062 ft) before subsiding. The outflow from Lake of the Woods, with the Norman Dam fully open, is currently 1375 m3/s. The level of the Winnipeg River immediately below Kenora is 319.43 m (1048.0 ft). The level rose 3 cm (1 in) over the past week. At Minaki, the level is 317.41 m (1041.4 ft), a rise of 2 cm (1 in) over the past week. The levels along the Winnipeg River in Ontario are the highest since 1950. The level at Nutimik Lake, in Manitoba, is 276.29 m (906.5 ft), a small decline over the past week. The level of the Winnipeg River in Ontario is expected to rise very slowly as Lake of the Woods levels continue to rise, causing outflow to gradually increase. In the Whiteshell area in Manitoba, Nutimik Lake level is expected to rise 25 cm (10 in) over the next two weeks due to increased Lac Seul outflows, if local inflows do not continue to decline. Throughout the system, further rainfall could also cause additional increases in water levels and flows. Regarding Lac Seul, the current level is 356.87 metres or 1170.8 ft. The level rose 13 cm (5 in) over the previous week and is expected to rise 4 to 8 cm (2 to 3 in) over the next week. Lac Seul is currently 41 cm (16 in) above its median August water level, and is 3 cm (1 in) below the top of the normal operating range for the lake. Lac Seul outflow was increased from 275 to 375 m3/s on Wednesday, June 20 and will be increased further to 450 m3/s on Friday, June 22. Pakwash Lake and the English River immediately below Ear Falls are expected to rise 15 to 20 cm (6 to 8 in). River levels below Manitou Falls may rise by 60 cm (24 in) as the outflow increases make their way downstream. Further Lac Seul outflow increases are likely on Wednesday, June 27."
