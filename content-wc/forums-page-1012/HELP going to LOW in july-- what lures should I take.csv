513177,darcyfish,2001-06-11 18:10:00,15,"What area are you planning to fish, jigs are the basic for walleyes 1/4 oz, for small mouth you can use a multitude of crank baits,tube jigs,spinner baits. For muskies bucktails are always a hit and easy to throw and crank baits of varoius sizes. If you have any more specific questions please feel free to drop me a line.[email protected]http://www.geocities.com/darcyfish54/1968.html"
513178,Guest,2001-06-11 18:19:00,0,"This can change based on the part of the lake you are fishing. I fish out of Morson in July and find that the eyes will hit minnows, not leaches, nor crawlers. On the lure side I use spoons or spinners(red devil, Johnson sliver minnow, white, red/black and yellow spinners) while for bass I use exclusively shad raps. Medium divers in crawfish & shad color work the best. Good luck and hope you find the big one!! Catching may be a different story."
513179,Dan,2001-06-12 12:12:00,325,"Depends a lot on which part of the lake your fishing. We fished NW angle area two weeks ago and did well on eyes with a 1/2 oz. lead head with dead minnow (in Canada). Leeches worked okay, but they were more interested in minnows. Very, very, very slow presentation. We ended up with a mess of eyes up to 28"". We had a little musky action (although the season wasn't quite open yet). Those were on stick baits and spinner baits. Smallies were taking jig/minnow and small to mid size crank baits. We also got some nice smallies and Norther using full size spinner baits in the cabbage. Good luck, Dan"
513180,Lunker,2001-06-13 06:27:00,27,"My lord!!! I'm certainly not going to discount what others have found success with, but I typically fish with much lighter jigs -1/16th or 1/8th oz at the most unless I'm fishing really really deep or the wind is howling. The jigs will work wonderfully with live bait for walleyes and with plastics for smallies. Otherwise, you might want some Husky Jerks and Shad Raps. Have a blast! I'll be at Witch Bay for two weeks in July.Lunker"
513181,Dan,2001-06-14 08:08:00,325,"We found a vertical presentation is the only way to detect the real light bites (and I do mean vertical - STRAIGHT DOWN). We boated 50+ eyes a day and they were biting very, very, light. The 1/2 oz. with a very slow straight down vertical presentation outfished everything. And we pretty much tried them all. You would have a heck of a time detecting anything in that lake with anything below 3/8. We ended up with 4 fish over 26"" and one 28, so you fish your way and I'll fish mine..."
513182,tod,2001-06-18 16:55:00,21,Anyone have more suggestions as for jigs do you use skirts with them/ thanks
513183,Guest,2001-06-19 08:56:00,0,"Tod,I just got back from LOTW Sunday, The fish were in 15 to 20 feet of water. Everything we tried caught fish. Jigs with live bait like leeches, minnows, a crawler cut in half. Lindy rigs, Spinners, plain hooks. They all worked.Some colors worked better than others at times.Vertical jiging, pitching, casting, bobber fishing. LOLUse your electronics to find fish on stucture and just put some bait in front of them....thell hit it.Good luckMark in MplsP.S. I will also be up there in July."
