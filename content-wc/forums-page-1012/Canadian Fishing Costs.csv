Our last trip we spent $180 on groceries for five guys for a week-and we eat very, very good. That $120 dollars you saved can buy more beer. After all, there's a sandwich in every can, right?We do the entire trip from Iowa to Lac Seul and back for $680 a person for an entire week. We drive up in a 36 motorhome so everybody is in one vehicle. Of course, you can't count all the tackle we buy because we use it here too."
513433,Guest,2001-06-23 12:13:00,0,"Just got back from Flin Flon, and for three people for one week, it costs us $340 each. That doesn't include the individual costs that everybody adds for themselves. Love that Canadian jam just about as much as that Kokanee beer!"
513422,Guest,2001-06-20 17:52:00,0,"I just thought i would let everyone in on what the true costs are to fish in Canada.1. 800.00 For fly-in fishing lodge. ( 1 week )2. 300.00 in groceries ( 4 folks )3. 150.00 new lures ( that i will have no other use for )4. 45.00 for the new reel ( as a back up )5. 35.00 for the new rod holder6. 100.00 for the portable depth finder ( always wanted one good excuse for one )7. 35.00 for the new tackle box ( old ones wouldnt hold all the new stuff )8. 50.00 gas for the trip ( per person )9. 25.00 hotels for drive there and back ( per person )10. 30.00 Canadian fishing liscense11. 30.00 batteries to run depthe finder, gps, cd player etc...12. 6.00 for the pound of minnows i have bought to salt13. 3.00 for the salt i used on the minnows14. 36.00 the new cooler 15. 29.00 my new bug proof shirtWell that is about all i can think of at this time. I am afraid to add this up. If my wife were to add this up it would then cost me even more. I have never even been to canada. And truthfully could care less at how much it will cost. I just thought it was kinda funny when i started thinking about it. Anyway, i will use every lure at least one time and am suer i will have the time of my life. That to me makes it worth ten times whatever it all adds up to be. See ya soon Canada. So be ready.-Chris"

513427,Guest,2001-06-21 02:33:00,0,"Your accounting is not in order. Account the way I do......New equipment doesn't count as it is still worth something, I view them as an asset, groceries are groceries whereever you stay.......You have to eat man.... I cost your trip at $905.....cheap for a one week holiday. Good fishing"

513430,Lunker,2001-06-22 05:43:00,27,BINGO !!!!! And don't forget the value of R & R.....also PRICELESS!!!Lunker
513431,Guest,2001-06-22 08:06:00,0,"Not so bad when you can amortize these costs over of tackle box,lures,etc.. over ther next many trips you take. You will HAVE to go more times to get the costs spread out!Also, on your minnow salting--use 3/4 borax and 1/4 salt so they do not dry out, lose their color and get brittle as the case with all salt."
