We caught 100 to 150 easly every day in the 3 to 5 lbs. range, few above 5 very few below 3 lbs. Caught plenty of Pike over 35 in. but no trophys, but then we never fished for them eather, the other gusts that fished for pike got 30+ master anglers during the week! If your looking for exellent walleye, pike fishing, good food , good acomedations, and a fair price I'd send you there way. I'll be going back every chance I get!!"

513438,JN,2001-06-21 10:13:00,47,"It's 30 mi. NW of Lynn Lake Mann. the lake name is Vanderchoven, you can find info by looking up Lynn Lake Tourisiam, I think the number is 1-800-BIG PIKE(not positive thou). It's been advertisied in the clasified of eather Outdoor Life or field and Stream for 20+ years. The owner is Fred Bettchem. It's known for big pike but I could never get away from the exellent walleye fishing to give it a try! I've been going to Canada for 20 yrs. and only had better fishing 1 time, the last 2 yrs. up there have been fantastic, the lake is a conservfation lake so I suspect It'll only get better. Oh yea it's a catch and release only for pike."
513439,JN,2001-06-22 18:50:00,47,"Forgot to tell ya about the forest fires up there! The Lodge was nerly wiped out, they had plnes and helecopters dumping water on the fire to try and stop it. At the last minute(100 ft. from the gas res.) the wind switched and saved the lodge!!!!!!!!! Man we were all lucky!!!!!!"
