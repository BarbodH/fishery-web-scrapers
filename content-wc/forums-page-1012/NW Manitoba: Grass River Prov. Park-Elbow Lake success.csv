The Big 4 Wilderness Camp hosted us on Elbow Lake and provided everything we asked for at a very reasonable price. We caught and released dozens of fish in the 2-4 lb range with a few 5 pounders. Elbow Lake is beginning to show excellent results with its conservation plan. The avg. fish size increasing. Pike were abundant and active, too. This is a highly recommended area without fishing pressure and very friendly folks at the Big 4 Wilderness Camp. Looking forward to a return trip."

513362,Guest,2001-06-21 08:52:00,0,Thanks for the info.We usually have some good fishing for pike in Simonhouse. I have never heard of this trampling lake. Although I'm not too familiar with the area it would be a nice change to catch some walleyes. Thank for the info..
