Has most of this been cleared out or drifted away by the end of June or do you need to be extra careful. Hate to smash up my boat/motor, this would ruin the trip. Also, I have heard that fish are coming out of shallow water this year. At least so far. Any fish seen on the reefs yet. How has the weather been? Alot of rain & cold weather. Any information regarding this region would be helpful.KMP.S. Have any of the regulations changed. Last year 1 fish over 19 / 3 under. No more then four fish total to bring home. However, only allowed two fish in boat on any given day. Is this all the same."

Was told by the locals that it is going to rise another foot in the next week. There is lots of floating debris, logs etc so be very careful. Also be careful about rocks that are now submerged that weren't before. Had a friend that hit one a couple of weeks ago. The fish were biting though and I didn't hear any complaints.Good Fishing,Bob M"

Up til now, the fish have been shoreline related and quite shallow.....2'-12'. However, they are now JUST BEGINNING to move to island points and mid-lake reefs. Should proceed more and more as the water begins to warm up.Lunker"
513372,Guest,2001-06-22 06:48:00,0,"KM,We were south of Kenora last week, There were trees, logs, ect, floating in some places so you need to be heads up when driving around. The fish were in most of there normal haunts, only shallower from 12 to 18 feet. Use your electronics to locate them and then apply that same depth to other structure. The fish were almost every where, more on some spots, less on others. Every live bait worked depending on the time of day, Crawlers seemed to work the best over all.Good luckMark in Mpls"
