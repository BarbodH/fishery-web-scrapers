I know these are tough months for walleye fishing, but would appreciate any tips and advise on walleye locations at this time of year. Is the river, near the tracks still productive this late in the year? Thanks for any info."
513320,Hunter,2001-06-17 20:40:00,346,"Several of us go to Rice August, every year. You know, the trip with the wives. We dont expect much, The area you mention Otanabee river, the weedbeds out in front of there produce eyes all year, but not in great numbers. I have had pretty good success, on the other side of the tracks from the river trolling bouncers with 6-8' crawler harnesses. Rice is probably the finest bluegill fishery in the world, they are just everywhere. Bass is also excellent. Walleye from what I understand on that lake is more night time bite, just too much traffic during the day. Have any questions fire away, Ill try to help you out."

There is a channel down the center of the lake and an old train bridge that is just under the water. This channel is usually pretty clear of weeds. Look for a weed line that is the correct water depth and it's like magic, you'll catch fish."
513321,Rob,2001-06-20 07:36:00,103,"Hunter,Thanks for the Rice Lake pointers. My famliy and I have never been to Rice Lake but are scheduled the last week of August to stay at Southview Cottages. From the brochue, it looks like the camp is on the NW side of the lake. We are bringing our 2 & 3 year old children and hope to find good panfish action. From where we are staying on the lake, can you provide locations and techniques that work best for bluegill/crappie/perch? While the kids are napping, dad and I will try to catch muskie and walleye. Any pointers would be greatly appreciated."
513322,Hunter,2001-06-20 08:39:00,346,"You will catch gills everywhere, It is infested with them, simple sinker with a couple hooks and small piece of worm. Crappies can get tough late in the year, just hard to find, but when you do look out! Perch in my experience have been wormy, but those gills are fantastic eating. You might want to change your gamefish to muskie& bass. I just havent had great success with eyes. Char. and perch coloured spinnerbaits are my mainstay here. Although a crank bait in a gill pattern was very hot for a buddy last year. I know of a couple guys that dunk rubber worms into weed pockets and they crush bass and also a few eyes every year. I fish Lake St.claire probably 10 times a year for bass, my best ever 6#4oz largemouth came from the Indian river you will find it on the map, I am not sure if this is reserve land now. If it isnt, I would check it out if I were you, it seems to not be as pressured.This body of water is very busy! You will meet people from everywhere. I dont like the crowds so I am up well before light, and am usually back for breakfast by 9:30. You will meet groups of fisherman at your camp that have fished the same week or two for years, these guys are always alot of help. GOOD LUCK"
