513326,Guest,2001-06-18 11:15:00,0,Hey great report!!! I am up there for a week June 30th - july 07/01. Any tips on presentaion and location would be greatly appreciated. We have never been before. Any other advise???Lance
513328,Guest,2001-06-19 08:51:00,0,We were in VIP 2 & 3 June 11 -> 15. The fishing makes the Lake of The Woods look like the Dead Sea!!!!!
513327,Keith,2001-06-19 10:52:00,48,"Fish were very shallow for us (5-6 feet). The last day they had moved out to 8-12 feet. By the end of June they should be out on the deeper reefs. Merit Point is a good place to try. I've been up there in August and the fishing is great than also. In the past the people that were at the Outpost itself could tell you where the fish were biting. The new people, Pat and Frenchy(?), aren't as up to snuff on the fishing. When you get into Sioux Lookout stop at Ojibway and buy a map of the area up there.Than at the landing have Ken show you where to fish. I'll look to see if I kept a map and if so I'll write and get you address and mail it to you with some spots."

513330,RMB,2001-06-20 21:09:00,251,"Hey Jigger1, Are you going up to Chamberlain Narrows? If so,I am going in the same days you are. We are a group of six in one of the VIP cabins. Three of our group are from down south and this will be a big adventure for them. I've been going there for 6 years now and talk about getting pumped up! I can't wait! I'll be in an Alumacraft TP175 (gray) with a 150 Opti and our other boat is a blue/green skeeter with a 150 Yammi Vmax. It would be nice to put some faces to names. If you are going there, tell me what to look for and we can say hi and maybe swap some hotspots. I can taste the Ole' Blue already!"
513331,Jigger1,2001-06-21 04:53:00,234,"RBM, Unfortunately I'll be fishing the central part of the lake, approximately 40 miles N/NE of Dryden, and won't be heading west. Last year, my first year on Lac Seul, my 13 yr old daughter and I caught 17 eyes over 25"", six of which were over 27"" with the largest 29"". My sights are targeted for a 30 this year. Talk about a fishery, I think I'm hooked (literally) for life!Best of Luck!"
513332,Guest,2001-06-21 06:53:00,0,"I'm heading to Williams Lake lodge for the 3rd straight year on 7-6. I too am hooked on the fantastic quality of fish. In a short timeframe one morning last year I caught a 26, 26.5 and a 27. As much walleye fishing as I've done, I've never seen the quality of fish like Lac Seul. I'm sold! This year we will be going out to Broad Lake area for an adventure, normally just stay in the Kleiner Point area and do really well on worms and leaches. Didn't even use minnows last year. Good luck and keep taking those kids fishing. They are the sports future."
