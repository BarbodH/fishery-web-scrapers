513206,Guest,2001-06-12 05:18:00,0,Got back from a nice little fishing trip yesterday. Four of us caught about 300 walleye on Sunday. Friday night we caught 100 and Saturday we fished for lake trout and caught and released a 12 and 17 pounder. How can you argue with fishing in Saskatchewan?

513208,JasonMN,2001-06-12 10:59:00,229,300 walleye...that is a fish every two minutes nonstop for 10 straight hours. You guys must have had sore arms.
513209,BobG-IL,2001-06-12 11:13:00,7,Every 8 minutes-there were 4 of 'em...no big deal. ;-)
