513238,hoghunter,2001-06-18 06:53:00,159,"Hey Crew. It is the law to fish with barbless hooks on Dogtooth. They will let you get by with squeezing the barb with a pair of pliers. Also, treble hooks are not allowed, only single hooks. The slot limit is between 19.7 and I think 26.5 inches. This size fish must be released. Alchohol is illigal in the boat also. I brought 18 gallons of extra gas for the boat, and was not even asked about it. We got checked at the border because we had 2 cases of beer apiece, and you are allowed one without having to pay duty on. We pulled over to pay duty on the extra cases, which was 7 bucks a case (ouch} and they checked the truck and boat. Go to Dogtooth resort, to get a map. The resort is just up the road from the campground. You can buy a lisence at any bait shop. Can't bring leeches across the border. Nightcrawlers are ok as long as they are in store bought worm bedding, no soil. Have a great trip, the campground is very nice. Watch for rocks in the lake. The resorts map has most of the hazards on it. Have a good one."
513239,Guest,2001-06-18 07:22:00,0,"Thanks for the quick response. What about the insects (black flies) we were warned that they can be bad in parts of Canada, are they a problem in this area? Can you have the treble hooks in your possession (in the boat) but not use them? Thanks!"

513241,hoghunter,2001-06-18 07:59:00,159,"Hey crew. The black flies were bad at times with no wind. You can have trebles in possesion, but not in use. Also, every rod with a hook on it, wether its in use or not, has to be crimped. The misquetoes were surprisingly not bad."
513242,Guest,2001-06-18 08:49:00,0,"Thanks, again! Is Dogtooth a two rod per person area or only one?"
513243,Guest,2001-06-18 09:05:00,0,one rod
513244,Michael,2001-06-18 11:14:00,53,"One over 25 1/2 to mountMay keep fish under 19.7 19.7 to 25 1/2 must releaseCrankbaits may have treble hooks, but everything else must have a single hook(cranks are not might first choose for a bait on Dogtooth)Only one line per personThese are things that I believe are true and helpful (if not, oops). You will want to read the rules book when you purchase your license. Good Luck!"
513245,Esox Maniac,2001-06-18 12:20:00,69,"FYI- Wayne & Patty (Dogtooth Lake Resort-it's just up the road from the Rushing River Campground)have Licenses, bait, leeches, crawlers & minnows- plus fuel (expensive $2.90 USD/gal) and most odds & ends that you might need. Catch'em & Let'em Go!><))))*>"
513246,Guest,2001-06-19 04:59:00,0,Hey Hoghunter how was the fishing?
513228,Esox Maniac,2001-06-13 06:53:00,69,"I posted this on the fishing report forum- but thought it might benifit those of you headed to the Kenora-LOTW area.Just got back from Dogtooth Lake- Stayed at Dogtooth Lake Resort- Great facilities & hospitality from Wayne & Patty Jones- Found the big eye's in the ""cabbage"" ~ 6-->9 ft. They were wacking a slow trolled large ""Northland"" Gum Drop floater (Orange & Chartruese) tipped w/ leech fished about 2-3 ft above a Lindy 1/4 ""No Snagg"". Use the large gumdrop it definitely keeps the leech up there. They didn't like the sun. But when the clouds & wind moved in they were very active- Friday afternoon we had thunderstorms - definitely turned the fish off-- FYI - Dogtooth also offers some great ""crappie action"" (fish the reeds). Wayne is an ""eye"" expert listen to every word & pay heed, there are valuable clues. No he won't tell you exactly where to go, but he'll give you the info you need to find them.Folks from ""Northland"" were there also, but didn't really seem interested in talking about their tackle. Was kind of disapointed in the attitude. If you're going to Dogtooth and want more info send me an Email. FYI saw a few meat hunters- but they were catching the little one's. Also saw a few A**holes, Lund ""IA- 503 TT - if you're reading this- I was the guy in the red & charcoal Skeeter SF150- We had the ""spot on a spot"" all to ourselves until they pull in & watch me catch a 25 3/4 walleye- imediately on the radio to their buddies who pull in about 5 minutes later- Now I'm fishing ~ 12 miles away from the resort w/ 2 boats circling me at less than 50 feet. Bummer- They watched my buddy catch a 25"" & imediatel;y switched to orange color leadhead. I guess they also had vision problems because they used a solid orange leadhead. Stuck around for another 10-15 minutes didn't catch squat & left. I had some choice advise about their ancestry.Dogtooth definitely has some quality eye's, my personal best was 28"", although I had several on that were +30"". Think ""North Land"" should offer a + hook size up from their large gumdrop, it would certainly increase the hookset in those big eye jaws. As you can see by the ""Esox Maniac"" handle I'm not really into walleye's, but do like to fish for them given a chance. PS: they're still all swimming.Catch'em & Let'em Go!><))))*>Esox Maniac"
513229,Red,2001-06-13 17:22:00,75,"Esox,I have fished this lake before and love it. But I'm curious what is a meat hunter to you? I love fish, when I'm in canada we have shore lunch every day! Is this a meat hunter? And I do bring home fish (legal size and limits) So am I bad for doing this? Just curious. Red"
513230,Red,2001-06-13 17:24:00,75,"Oh by thhe way this was a good report, thanks Red"
513232,Scott,2001-06-13 18:03:00,385,"Great post EM, now you got me excited, headed up on Sunday. I shot you an Email, hopefully it worked. Thanks!"
513231,Esox Maniac,2001-06-14 12:34:00,69,"Hi Red - A meat hunter is someone who kills every fish that comes into the boat even the slot's and the trophy's. FYI - we had a fish fry one night out of seven. I don't begrudge anyone the right to take a personal best trophy or to eat fish. But there are some pigs out there.Hope you have fun & I really hope you catch some of the one's I let go.Catch'em & Let'em Go!><))))*>FYI- The guy I was fishing with was meat hunter mentality when we started- At the end he turned loose a 27"" walleye. The biggest he's ever caught. :-)"
513233,hoghunter,2001-06-15 02:10:00,159,Check out this aireal view of Dogtooth Resort and the lake. Compare it with your maps. Very interesting. Have a great day. http://www.tnicol.net/dogtooth/1999/aerial3.jpg
513234,Scott,2001-06-15 02:33:00,385,"Hoghunter, how went the adventure up there? Headed up real soon, inquiring minds want ta know."
513235,hoghunter,2001-06-15 03:06:00,159,"Hey Scott. Our party did ok, with a couple in the 29"" range. Lots of slot fish. My ""spots"" did not do so well, so had to go looking which was fun to find new spots. Overall it was a good trip. You should do well. Bought leeches at Witherspoons in Fort Francis, and they were better than they have been. Nothing special, but adaquite. Make sure your hooks are crimped, as heard reports of tickets being issued. Didn't run into any law enforcement myself, but they were in our camp while we were out on the lake, checking freezers. Leeches and crawlers were running neck in neck as far as productivity was concerned. We worked over Kilvert pretty thouroughly, but had to work at getting them to cooperate. As I said, you should do well. Weather was decent, and did better on Wednesday when light rain and clouds prevailled all day. Would love to pack up and head up again, but wife would have a baby, and probably wouldn't be mine. Have a great trip, be safe. You'll do good."
513236,Guest,2001-06-18 04:34:00,0,"headed up on fri morning. I would like to hear some spots and a report if possible.Hoghunter email me if you can.I,ve heard from some guides that Dog turns off at the end of june. IS THAT TRUE?Let me know"
513237,Guest,2001-06-18 06:23:00,0,"Help! We (Dad and I)are heading up to Dogtooth this week and it's our first trip to Canada and our second trip in the slide in camper. We are staying at the park and have no idea of the lake or rules. Any suggestions would be great. We are new at this!!! Here are a few questions that we have, can we buy a license in Fort Francis and get the regulations there or is there a better place? We are beginning our journey near Fargo. When you say crimp the hooks does that mean that it is illegal to use barblesss hooks or are you just making a good suggestion for C&R. Is it true that you cannot take any fuel in Canada? Does that include TCW 3 motor oil? I have to add my own as I don't have an oil reserve. Where can I get a map of the lake? Again, we are new at this Canada stuff. We figured this would be a good practice run for a longer stay and a longer trip. Let me add this we are not meat hunters, we release all large fish and rarely eat walleye as we have plenty of perch. Is the size limit 16 to 20 inches with one over 20? We wouldn't keep a trophy fish anyway as I think a graphite replica is the way to go. Finally, if you have any suggestions here is my e-mail address [email protected] I would appreciate an idea of where to strt fishing, we are staying three nights and will probably only fish a little as the camper and area is so new to us. Thank you!!!!"
