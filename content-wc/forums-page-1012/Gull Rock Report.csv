513145,Guest,2001-06-19 11:50:00,0,"I heard about Gullrock Bay, Stone Bay, and all around boot island. this is shallower water. That report was from last week. I talked with the camp on Thursday, said fishing was extremely good. You should have no problems. Please let us know about your week.ThanksJeff"
