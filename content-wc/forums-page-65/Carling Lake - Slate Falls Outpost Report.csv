We arrived on the 15th and stayed at the SFO bunk house and flew out first thing in the morning. At the last minute, my brother and wife decided to join us. They enjoy fishing but are novices and simply appreciate the boat rides and scenery and occasional fish for them. For my wife and I, we caught 607 walleyes of the 5 1/2 days we targeted them. We spent a 1/2 day chasing lake trout and another day with high winds and rain we decided to stay in the cabin for the most part. The camp was exceptional, fishing was even better. I'd say average walleye size was between 18 and 19"" with many in the 20 to 21"" range (largest being 24""). We didn't target northerns but caught at least a 100+ with quite a few in the mid 30's and few in upper 30's. SFO is everything that everyone has said; they are exceptional, professional and just look for ways to make your trip a success. Carling is a beautiful lake (just like everyone has said with lots of water to explore). I'd certainly recommend them and will plan to visit again soon. Special thanks to WC Members DOC and Walleyski for their help in marking up a map for us to check out."
