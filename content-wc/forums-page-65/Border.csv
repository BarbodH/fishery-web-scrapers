Friday at 11:45am he gets his ID NOW so should have results back by 2 and hit the road whenever we want then. General question on the ArriveCAN app, do we each do it or just 1 to include both of us?"
6591600,prov1800,2021-08-20 17:06:00,5010,Agreed Gord on everything.But still strange

6592524,Juls,2021-08-25 08:34:00,13414,"Come on guys.....we relaxed on the rules, so you could discuss the border with mention of COVID and COVID testing. That does not mean we have changed any rules on Political comments. Please play by the rules so threads do not get deleted? Can you at least....try? Thanks, and have a great day!"
6592544,emma17,2021-08-25 09:50:00,436,"Thanks Juls. Question on test results (I think I read answer in previous post but need confirmation). With all the Delta spread going on w vaccinated people, I'm worried me or someone in my group will test positive within 72 hours before arriving to Canada. If we are all fully vaccinated but end up w a positive test, can the person that tested positive still cross?"
6592562,emma17,2021-08-25 11:34:00,436,"I'm going to respond to my own post (but I don't have an answer). My concern is- with the rapid spread of Delta among vaccinated people (my whole group is vaccinated), there is a risk of the PCR test coming back positive in the 72 hour window. As it seems many who contract it are symptom free, I fear a surprise positive. If any of us test positive, we won't know how long we've been positive. I found a good post from Guidedfishing from 8/20/2021, copied below. With the below in mind, are we wise to get tested now (the plan is to cross the border 9/11) so that if any of us come back positive, we would be between the 14 and 180 day window for those testing positive?"
6592590,valley366,2021-08-25 15:12:00,193,I don't know that getting tested now really would do anything that would ensure you are negative in 2 weeks. It might give you a hint that someone needs to get it out of their system by then and maybe you want to distance yourself from that person until you depart. But the screwed up part about COVID is even in the places like MLB/NHL/NFL where they are doing daily screening there are some that are positive on Wed that were clean on Tuesday.We tried to back off our involvement to others this past week leading up to our tests. Still did a lot of normal things but attempted to keep distance when around people. Its hard with kids and being involved with regular activities again but just told them to keep their distance where they could.
6592600,RichA$1970,2021-08-25 16:04:00,1159,I got the ID Now test today and results back in an hour. My buddy had to go to CVS and Walgreens but got a different lab test as they are out of the ID Now tests in his area. Anyone now how long it’s taking as it said 2-5 days which we need to cross Saturday by 2pm for mine to be good.
6592602,valley366,2021-08-25 16:10:00,193,When I inquired at the CVS here in Maple Grove they said generally back within 72 hours. The one case that she noted was going long was over a weekend. IE tested on a Friday.Some facilities I inquired with openly said they were pushing up to the 72 hour window.May want to have him look around for one of the quick tests even if it means paying out of pocket.
6592610,emma17,2021-08-25 16:40:00,436,"Backing off is a good idea. I know I didn't explain my thought well. Let's say I test positive 72 hours before- but that I actually contracted COVID two weeks before I went for the test. I don't think the test tells me how long I've had COVID? In this scenario, based on the 14-180 window I copied in the previous post, I would be better off testing now (assuming I test positive). If I wait and test 72 hours before and it comes back positive, I believe I'm stuck home (as is the whole group as I'm the driver/payer). It seems to me I should test 15 days before and if positive, I would fall in the 14-180 day exception category. If negative, I have to test again within 72 hours anyway and have to hope it comes back negative. I'm covering our trip in the event I/we have COVID now. I hope this makes sense."
6591524,prov1800,2021-08-20 10:14:00,5010,See US is keeping border closed to Canadians.wtf.
6591526,That Minnesota guy,2021-08-20 10:41:00,8293,I would have thought you would be to busy to visit anyway.
6591528,RichA$1970,2021-08-20 10:42:00,1159,Well they also are keeping it closed in Kabul so they’re consistent. Does not make sense especially with what’s going on down south. I’m surprised Trudeau is not asking WTF but I hope the border stays open at least for 8 more days as I’m crossing Saturday at 0230 for Savant Lake.
6591530,prov1800,2021-08-20 10:47:00,5010,Not busy at all.Next week bit of guiding and Sept good.
6591532,prov1800,2021-08-20 10:50:00,5010,You will be good.Hardly any more smoke either so bonus youll be able to breathe.
6591534,Camoclad,2021-08-20 10:50:00,628,"To some degree, yes it is closed to land travel which sucks for those wanting to access the near border amenities, though I believe you can still fly anywhere in the country as a means of border crossing. I am not saying that is right or makes any sense, just that the opportunity does exist if you fly. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
6591536,prov1800,2021-08-20 10:58:00,5010,Could fly to states since pandemic started.But the they had quarantine rules.I know US has rising cases but with vaccines and most Canadians being vaccinated i dont get it.I don't plan on coming to US till winter but there are lots of folks that want to go and see family.
6591564,v-bay gord,2021-08-20 13:44:00,3168,Who cares?
6591590,prov1800,2021-08-20 15:51:00,5010,Are you having a bad day Gord.
6591598,v-bay gord,2021-08-20 16:55:00,3168,"Nope, the fish are biting, it's raining...it's all good. Hence, why do I need to go south of the border when I'm already living in paradise?"
