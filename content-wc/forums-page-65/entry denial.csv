6592874,Eckohlt,2021-08-27 04:53:00,3685,"Exactly!!!,then it's a done deal."
6592880,last chance,2021-08-27 05:45:00,3262,I've never been there but have heard of guys getting turned away if they have had a DUI or DWI in the last so many yrs. but it's not guaranteed that if you have an older charge that you'll get through. so make sure your crew has a clean record. because covid isn't your only worry.
6592884,johnboat,2021-08-27 05:47:00,2014,"There is a pharmacy in Baudette that gives COVID tests. It's not the best Plan B, but it's there if you need it."
6592904,That Minnesota guy,2021-08-27 06:58:00,8293,There are places in International Falls also if you can wait for the results.
6592926,Fisherman Ted,2021-08-27 08:24:00,461,"Border agents have always had the power to deny entry. This is nothing new. At I-Falls I have not heard of one person being turned around if they had all of their ducks in order. ArriveCan. Back-up copy of the negative test. And you are good to go. All of my guests have been treated well and over the past 2 weeks crossing at I-Falls has been a breeze. And correct, they don't ask to see your ArriveCan app because that has already been uploaded to their system and is right in front of them when you cross. They will know instantly if you have done it. Or not. -FT"
6592968,emma17,2021-08-27 10:39:00,436,Thanks Fisherman Ted- I hope your camp has a great remainder of the season.
6592974,David Anderson,2021-08-27 10:44:00,2073,"Well, I think we have all our ducks in a row. The guy wanting to bring an emergency car is just being cautious, besides he's our host! I am surprised at the total misinformation about the testing. Searched Covid test near me and you get a ton of places but the ones who don't need a referral have to send them out and it takes 24 - 48 hours for results, the rapid results while you wait seem like there all out of them or simply are tired of dealing with them. I have a appointment at the CVS in Anoka, last appointment on Wednesday, should have results by Friday so it's good to see reports of I Falls crossings going smooth. I addition I emailed my doctor and told him exactly what I need as he is a good doc, hopefully he can arrange a rapid, results while you wait appointment. A lot of places who say they do it need a referral, you have to have symptoms, or some other reason. One Clinic near me states they do them but when I called...no they don't want to deal with travelers. It is amazing that there isn't a simple process to get this done, even the Walgreens that someone from here stated they did the test now says they don't. Maybe I am being too critical and I should just have faith in the system.....right!"
6593050,Guest,2021-08-27 15:22:00,0,The NAAT test is the Rapid test. Had my results from Walgreen's in less than one hour. Their website shows which tests are available at each location. Not all locations offer it however the Web site clearly shows who has what.
6592792,NARDA 1,2021-08-26 15:19:00,636,"Have you checked with your doctors office? After speaking with my local Walgreens and they explained that they didn't have anymore of the IDnow/PCR tests and couldn't guarantee 3 day results for the NAAT test, I called my doctors office to see if they had any ideas and they told me that they offered the PCR test and give you the results when you leave."
6592794,Eckohlt,2021-08-26 15:30:00,3685,"Doesn't get any better than that,results before you leave and printed out for you.Jack pot."
6592796,eyecatcher1,2021-08-26 15:52:00,323,I have Healthpartners insurance and they did the test on a Saturday and I had the results in less than 24 hours. My travel day was the following Monday.
6592800,SweetD,2021-08-26 16:36:00,243,I would tell the guy worried about it he is on his own and welcome to drive his car up. I wouldn’t foot the bill for him either. My two cents.
6592808,jgarstecki,2021-08-26 17:11:00,2,We had our Covid test today at CVS. They said it can take 24-48 hours to get the results… we are leaving Saturday morning for a 10 hour drive to I Falls… does anyone know if you must PRINT OUT the results - or will they accept the email from your phone? Just wondering if I have to try to find someplace “on the road” to try to print out an email if we don’t receive them before we leave? Maybe stop at a library to print them??
6592814,Eckohlt,2021-08-26 17:28:00,3685,"Phone or print out gonna show the same thing,I would say phone email would work,but remember I'm not a border agent,,,Yet"
6592818,Wallychowder,2021-08-26 17:39:00,1567,I'm still wondering if they ratified their contract ?
6592826,Eckohlt,2021-08-26 17:56:00,3685,"Not yet,they still want all the confiscated walleye for home use."
6592862,Baseline,2021-08-26 21:03:00,3207,"I went to Canada 10 days ago and crossed at I-falls. I brought my vax card, print out of negative test, and passport. Drove up to the window and 5 mins later I was on my way. The Border guy I had said he didn't need to see the Arrive Canada app. However, I would download and complete it because you must upload your passport, and vax card. It also requires a physical address of a quarantine location. Your resort can be used. We stayed at Timberwolf Lodge north of Fort Francis. Upon arrival the owner had us fill out a Covid information form with guidelines and sign in with our name, phone number, email and address in case they needed to do contact tracing. The owner also told us that each resort needs to provide a space for quarantine if it should become necessary. You will also be required to wear a mask at all indoor establishments. I think there is a lot of internet noise about problems at the entry points. If you have your documentation I believe you are good to go."
6592872,Wallychowder,2021-08-27 04:29:00,1567,and Nightcrawlers !!!!!
6592666,David Anderson,2021-08-25 23:02:00,2073,I have a group of 10 heading to Canada on September 4th. I have heard of the Canadian border guys refusing entry even with all the applicable documents. We are thinking about taking a car and parking it somewhere in case someone gets refused entry that they have a way back home. Anyone run into this issue?
6592686,fishingfever,2021-08-26 04:14:00,85,"3 of us went into Canada on the 8/13. It took about 5 minutes. If you have all your documents why would you be refused? Just be sure to wear your mask as you pull up to the border agent. Ours was a little upset that we weren't already wearing ours. He said even in public in Ontario you are supposed to have them on. Some of the locals in Fort Frances were wearing them as they walked around, most were not."
6592692,Obabikon,2021-08-26 06:15:00,2370,Negative test within 72 hours… PCR or NAAT are most common Fill out arrivecan Bring vaccine card with you. You will be good to go. Only way you will be denied entry is everyone hasn’t accomplished everything.
6592696,That Minnesota guy,2021-08-26 06:22:00,8293,If you need a place to leave a car contact me.
6592702,Guest,2021-08-26 06:43:00,0,David. What is your source for this information. I would like to examine that more closely. Thank You i suspect it's just the wild spread of another RUMOR from the uneducated.
6592704,cuamb,2021-08-26 06:58:00,203,"Hi Dave, I have not heard this but the car thing is an interesting idea. Is there a bus that goes from IF to MSP or Duluth? Teresa and I are getting our covid tests today. Leave Saturday. We will be on our way home on the 4th. I will give you a call then. Paul"
6592726,David Anderson,2021-08-26 09:09:00,2073,"Paul, Still trying to find someplace to do the tests as the previous poster stated about the Walgreens in Anoka, a visit there and they stopped doing them. Oh well I have a week! Really, You might be right however this was brought up by on of our group members and I volunteered to seek information. I suspect it has started from someone not meeting all the requirements then complaining about it. Either way he is determined to have an extra vehicle just in case. Tonight we have a meeting and I will report that any spec of information that is deemed incorrect, you are on your own as they are all big boys now! TMG, thanks for the offer, I will bring that up as well. Sometimes getting everyone on the same page is like herding cats."
6592736,Hillbiehle,2021-08-26 09:54:00,66,"I'll spare you the challenges that we experienced, but keep in mind that some Walgreens have a 3 to 5 day turnaround (not the 24/48 hours that many expect) and they don't tell you this until at the testing site. In addition, they won't do same day appointments. When all else fails (from experience), I recommend going to the MSP airport and paying the $200 for the 1 hour test results. I parked in the Gold Ramp and somehow chose the correct level and walked in 15' and there was the testing center. I was back in my car in less than 5 minutes and had the results emailed to me within the hour. Looking back with all the frustration with CVS (they had our appointment wrong) and Walgreens fiasco, I would have saved alot of stress and frustration of just paying the $200."
6592742,@Lunker,2021-08-26 10:15:00,835,"From fishing fever - “If you have all your documents why would you be refused?”From Obabikon - “Only way you will be denied entry is everyone hasn’t accomplished everything.”I disagree with Obabikon and I’ll tell you why, fishingfever…..It was recently said elsewhere on some post in regard to this very matter (not going to bother looking it up) that (paraphrasing) “it’s up to the individual agent at the border” and that’s the key. Each individual agent has the latitude to be as arbitrary and capricious as they feel like for whatever reason, regardless of where the directive comes from…..and I’ve experienced it personally. Some years ago, I was attempting to cross the border within the context of a work permit. The specific resort had covered all the bases, including written support from Ontario Sunset Country and had the matter APPROVED all the way through the MINISTRY IN TORONTO. However, the agent in Fort Frances said, in effect, pffftttt, ain’t good enough….DENIED. I’m not trying to rain on anyone’s parade and I’m hoping all goes well for me when I try to cross next Tuesday. Personally, I never assume entry is a sure thing. I’m always holding my breath to a certain extent that the border agent didn’t have a pi$$y morning with the wife that day and is going to take it out on me."
6592748,cuamb,2021-08-26 10:40:00,203,My wife had her test today at 9:45 am (ID Now) and results are already available. I went to Mayo clinic this AM and they said 12 to 24 hours for results.
