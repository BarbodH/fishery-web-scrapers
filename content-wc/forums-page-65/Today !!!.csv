Re a previous post, at 71, I don’t get “giddy-excited” about much any more although I do look forward to things with “anticipation.” (Can I differentiate?) Anyway…..I am particularly excited about this trip. 2 1/2 years ago, while wintering in (on?) Roatan, Honduras, I met a couple guys from Winnipeg. Turns out one of them spends lots of time fishing on LOTW and, through keeping in touch, find we’re going to be up there at the same time. So we’ve made plans to meet up out on the water and spend a day fishing together. What Paul doesn’t know is that he’s going to get a “gift box” of brats and WI cheeses. Yeeahhh ~fist pump~"
