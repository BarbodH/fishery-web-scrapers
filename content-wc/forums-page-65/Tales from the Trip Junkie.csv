6591710,adempsey2.0,2021-08-21 11:16:00,611,Thanks Andrew. It was my pleasure. I would also be more than happy to help anyone who may be interested in any of the outpost camps and lodges that I have had the privilege to spend time at.
6591716,Stauff,2021-08-21 11:37:00,110,"The resource you've provided with the fishing outpost site and your willingness to pass it on are greatly appreciated! The maps and suggestions you gave me two years ago for Kaby made for one of our best excursions. In fact, headed back there again on September 4th. Thank you!"
6591730,gordy28,2021-08-21 14:34:00,437,"Thanks all and thanks Adam! Like many on here I love your site and use it a lot as we scout lakes Listing boats, acres, electric facilities etc is so great. So many outfitter sites don't cover the details so I jump to your site Cheers Andrew"
6591734,RichA$1970,2021-08-21 14:43:00,1159,I really like Adam’s site. Only question is when I try to filter an outfitter it only allows 1 selection. Is there a fox or am I doing something wrong as it almost stalls out.
6591894,adempsey2.0,2021-08-22 10:59:00,611,"The ""stalling out"" is an ongoing issue that I am working on. I believe it has to do with the cache. I just made some updates and hopefully that problem is now fixed. As for selecting a single outfitter and pulling up all the entries associated with that outfitter, I did not design it that way. When you click on an outfitter entry, it just opens up that single entry for the outfitter. To pull up all of the entries under a given outfitter, you have to use the text search bar. You could also select the nearest city to pull up all the entries. However, your expectations are logical and I believe that what you want is a much better way to present the data. I will think about how I may be able to implement that in the future."
