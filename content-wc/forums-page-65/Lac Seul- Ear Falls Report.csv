6590868,dakota eye,2021-08-17 19:37:00,69,What was your method at that depth?
6590938,mswope13,2021-08-18 07:07:00,73,1/4 and 3/8 oz jigs tipped with minnow. Wish I would have brought some plastics as we ran out of minnows 2 days.

6591554,alanexpup,2021-08-20 12:33:00,278,The last time we were there the take home limit was very minimal. Hardly worth the effort to take any home.
6593660,fishingMN4eyes,2021-08-30 11:36:00,108,"After a bit of a stressful Sunday morning we made it up safely to fish 8/23-8/26. We had one test in our group that didn't come back in time so we had to get a rapid test Sunday morning on our way out of town. The only issue at the border was the agent not being able to pull all my info on the ArriveCan app. Luckily I was able to give him my receipt number, he found it that way, and we were good to go after that. Weather was not the best with rain every day, but it wasn't awful and I don't think it really affected the fishing. No real downpours or anything, but between that and the cooler weather we were in our rain suits the entire week. Winds were manageable except Wednesday when we got chased out of McKenzie. We fished around Steamboat every other day. We caught tons of slot to 23"" fish with a couple 25-26"" mixed in our group. It was not tough to catch our overs and, as others have said, there seem to be plenty of 17"" unders. First day it didn't seem to matter what we threw at them, bouncers with blades/crawlers and jig/minnow seemed to fish very even. The rest of the week jig/minnow still produced fish in decent numbers but bouncers with either a smile blade or a Montana blade were catching much better size/quality. We didn't really nail down a pattern as we caught fish as shallow as 8-10' and as deep as 35'. FWIW, there was another group in camp(making much longer runs than we did) and they said their best fishing was 30-35' with big fish too. I don't know why I'm surprised anymore, but my only complaint is the number of boats who pull right up on a spot and fish less than 40 or 50 yards away. The same boat did it to us two of the days we fished Steamboat. There seemed to be less traffic than usual and we caught at least a handful fish at literally every spot we tried. Go find your own spot and take over the spot when we've moved on, there are so many fish in that lake you don't need to do party fish. Other than that it was a great trip with lots of laughs, can't wait for August 2022 now."
6590684,mswope13,2021-08-16 18:31:00,73,"I realize there's multiple reports already posted, but in case someone might be going up to the NW side of Lac Seul, here it is. My group of 3 got in line at 3:30 a.m. Monday morning. Crossed at 11:00 with all four bays open. I was surprised there was no request to see our negative test, just gave them the ArriveCan confirmation #, the normal questions regarding tobacco or liquor, and off we went in less than 4 minutes. We fished out of Evergreen Lodge in Ear Falls. Was stunned to see we were one of two groups at camp. We got out on the lake Monday at 5:00, went to Steamboat and boated over 100 fish in 3 hours. Parked over the top of them and it was insane. I've NEVER fished Steamboat without seeing a boat. That was somewhat strange. Tuesday: Went back to Steamboat and saw one boat. Winds picked up and never surrendered through Friday. Went to a different spot with the same results, over 100 fish. Wednesday, Thursday, Friday: Same story. I had my reservations about the fishing being better due to low pressure, so I held down my expectations. There's no doubt, that HAD to be a factor. We were on fish every minute of every day. It was the most amazing experience we had in over 20 years of fishing Lac Seul. The most important thing was not the amazing fishing, but getting back to our one week summer home we hold so sacred. My father is 88 and who knows how many more trips we might be able to make. But if he can handle those 4' rollers we encountered, he has many more years to come."
6590696,five in the box,2021-08-16 19:58:00,17,Did you see a silver Chevy truck with a topper pulling a black/silver Lund 1875 pro guide? Or maybe a maroon F150 pulling a black/white alumacraft? We got in line about the same time.
6590720,rather-be-fishin,2021-08-16 21:58:00,429,Thanks for the update! Sounds awesome! Sure had been windy! ðŸ‘Ž Headed to Lac Seul on 8/27& countdown is on!!! RBF
6590754,mswope13,2021-08-17 07:11:00,73,Most certainly did. We were the in the white suburu (Arkansas plate). I will never complain again about how much time it takes to cross the border!
6590762,bus33,2021-08-17 07:41:00,289,We fished out of Ear Falls last week also. Took us 8.5 hours to get across the border. We were in a private cabin so Monday was a work day for us getting it up and running again. The rest of the week we fished Steamboat also. Fishing was amazing. We noticed an abundance of those 17.75 inch take homers. We also caught many slot and overs. We pulled spinners and spot locked over top of them too. It seemed 18-20 fow was the ticket all week. You were right about the wind too....we've been going up there for many years and never has it been this windy every day of the week. We saw a few of the same Evergreen boats all week. We were in a white alumacraft and a silver lund.
6590764,bigeee99,2021-08-17 07:46:00,8,Why would it take over 8 hours to cross the border if they were pushing cars through in 5 minutes? We're there that many cars in line?
6590772,bus33,2021-08-17 08:30:00,289,Very long line (over a mile when we got in line) and only 2 lanes open when we went through.
6590792,Habitual Eyer,2021-08-17 11:18:00,144,Hey MSROPE...how long of a ride from Evergreen to Steamboat ??
6590796,bus33,2021-08-17 11:54:00,289,[QUOTE=Habitual Eyer;6590792]Hey MSROPE...how long of a ride from Evergreen to Steamboat ??[/QUOT It's around 9 miles from Ear Falls to the narrows entering Steamboat.
6590860,mswope13,2021-08-17 18:25:00,73,"It takes us 30 minutes with our 60 horse motor to get down to Steamboat Narrows, once through the narrows, head east along the shore line to the 3 islands (5-6 minutes). There's no doubt in my mind that Steamboat holds more fish than the area up by our camp. I will say that there's some shelfs south of Goose Island that holds fish and can be really good. We had most of our luck in 22-27' of water. We anchored and the wind would swing us from 8' to 26'. I know we pulled multiple pigs out of 8-12' of water, but the heavy action came around 22'. We also ran into an unusual amount of 17-17 3/4"" freezer fish. Possibly because they didn't get harvested last year would be my assumption. We also pulled more slot and over's than years past, and it wasn't even close. It was truly a trip we will never forget!"
