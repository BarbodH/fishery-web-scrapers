6593100,Guest,2021-08-27 19:52:00,0,Hey all! Wondering if anyone has flown in and been through the border check? The only posts I've seen are folks driving over the border although I certainly may have missed some. Our group flies into Winnipeg next week for an Outpost trip in Northern Manitoba and I'm curious (nervous) about what to expect. We are all vaccinated and will have the test prior of course. Thanks for any reports or experiences! Mas

Will you have to test and show a negative at the border? If so, where and how are you testing being at an outpost camp?"
6593646,spoonchucker,2021-08-30 10:55:00,82,The issue you will have flying in is have you have a connecting flight say from Toronto to Winnipeg. We had guys in our group and in fact the entire plane from Boston missed the connecting flight because they could not get processed in time. When you return by land you merely show passport. Just got back and will give report later. There is no re entry test as US citizen is an essential traveler returning by land to US.
