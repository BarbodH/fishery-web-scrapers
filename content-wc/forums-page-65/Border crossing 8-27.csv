6593080,Fishin Fun,2021-08-27 18:41:00,218,Our border crossing last week was the same. We drove right up to the border agent and it took 5-7 minutes. Very easy.
6593090,Hookhunter75,2021-08-27 19:11:00,60,My border crossing was more of the same. Only reason it took a little longer is because I shot the **** with the border guard and had a firearm to check in.
6593094,Eagle1,2021-08-27 19:17:00,28,Each of us also had the ID Now test thru Walgreens.
