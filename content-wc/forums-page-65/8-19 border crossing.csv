6592402,Eckohlt,2021-08-24 16:11:00,3685,"Has anyone been over the 72 hours on the test results shown at the border??,if so did they say anything about it?"
6592410,djk50164,2021-08-24 17:23:00,370,I asked the agent about this and he said it is up to the agent. I have heard of people that did not make the requirement and yes they were turned around.
6592412,Eckohlt,2021-08-24 17:41:00,3685,"Wow,you would think they would bend a few hours on that."
6592418,djk50164,2021-08-24 18:15:00,370,You know how it goes there are rules and people that enforce them. I never liked the reply it is up to the agent. Just make the 72 hour requirement and sleep good.
6592428,Hookhunter75,2021-08-24 19:27:00,60,I realize this is a dumb question and has probably been asked already. I have completed my ArriveCAN information and am ready to cross the border. What happens if due to traffic or normal travel delays you do not make it at your announced time on ArriveCAN?My time is scheduled for crossing at 1600 on 8/26 would there be issues if you showed up later than that.
6592432,djk50164,2021-08-24 19:38:00,370,I also asked the agent that question and he said they use it to make sure they have enough people on staff just try to make it close if you are off by many hours just change it in the app.
6592452,RichA$1970,2021-08-24 21:33:00,1159,"Eck,Just don’t stop at all the porn shops on the way up and you will be on time."
6592468,Eckohlt,2021-08-25 03:18:00,3685,"Good advice rich never thought of that,for sure I'll be in the time frame now."
6592488,eyecatcher1,2021-08-25 06:50:00,323,I arrived 2.5 hours early and they never said a thing. That was Fort Frances August 16.
6592596,Eckohlt,2021-08-25 15:36:00,3685,"Being early is good,being late after the 72 hours might not be so good."
6591446,JAY221,2021-08-20 04:29:00,877,"We pulled up to the Canadian border station at ft Frances at about 8:30 pm and was the fourth vehicle in line at the single station that was open. The first vehicle took about ten minutes at the window and was pulled over for a reason unknown to us. The next two took about five minutes each and then it was our turn. I handed her our passports and answered the regular questions as to where we weee going and how long we were staying. Asked to show our vaccine card and prove of a negative test result and was advised to keep a list of where went to in public for tracing purposes if need be and to wear a mask in public settings and to have a good time. We thanked her and was through in about five minutes. It really wasn’t anything more than to be expected under these conditions and am very happy to be here. Later, Jay"
6591456,Mojo-NC,2021-08-20 06:23:00,1929,"Thanks for the updated information. We've only crossed on Fridays. I assume Fridays and Saturdays are the busy days considering all lodges I've been to run from Saturday to the following Friday or Saturday. Does yesterday not being busy indicate the craziness is beginning to subside or would it be expected that every Friday and Saturday will still remain crazy and other days of the week will be closer to ""normal""? Thanks in advance. We are heading up 3 weeks from today and will be crossing on a Friday morning or early afternoon, depending on whether our flight arrives on time!"
6591588,kettyspanky,2021-08-20 15:21:00,271,We crossed last Saturday. We were there about noon ( bad timing). We waited 2 hours. We got to the window and it took about 3 minutes and we were on our way. The Saturday thing was probably 30 cars. This was at pigeon river crossing.
6591964,Turlington tom,2021-08-22 18:48:00,3,Did you fill out the Arriv Can app?
6592000,JAY221,2021-08-22 21:00:00,877,"Yes. You must fill out arriveCan document and be prepared to show your vaccine and test results along with the regular stuff like passport etc. later, Jay"
6592044,3M TA3,2021-08-23 07:14:00,2846,"No line at Sault Ste, Marie on 14th, 9AM. Nobody at gate except us driving up to it. Handed 1 passport and 2 enhanced DL to officer and 3 minutes later we're driving north. Didn't need test doc or vaccine record. He already had that on his screen. Just routine questions + a few symptom questions. Never been so smooth. 3 minutes. Just amazing since we were expecting 3 hours instead."
6592080,djk50164,2021-08-23 09:34:00,370,"Crossed I falls 9-12 11:30 am. No line 3 lanes opened. Attendant made sure all passengers had a mask on during the conversation. Asked for identification which we handed then our arrive can info popped up on there side no need to present the number given on the app. I had my vaccination card in a plastic holder which he recommended the other passengers to do. Also the other passengers did not submit the pictures correctly for both of the vaccines even know they show up in the first picture. If your vaccination card has both on one side submit the picture in both areas. He then asked for our covid test which we gave him and no issues. He then began to ask about the normal guns, marijuana, etc. He did ask about bait especially worms and salted minnows of which we did not have. As the questions were being asked I was looking inside and thought it was funny that the agents were not wearing there mask but when I walked in to pay duty the had them on. We did not get picked for the lucky covid test kit in which we were happy. Took about 15 minutes with paying duty. Also one of our passengers had an expired passport about 2 years ago and no problems either side and none even mentioned anything about it. On US return 8/22 1:30 pm the border agent on duty lived in a town next to ours and when he said which one we responded we remembered him a couple of years ago and he was impressed. Took about 30 seconds on the US side."
6592260,cuamb,2021-08-24 06:52:00,203,Does anyone know what the wait times have been at IF on Saturdays? We plan to be there around 2 pm on Saturday Sept. 11th. If wait times are excessive we can adjust our travel times. Also crossing Pigeon River this Saturday noon. Any ideas on wait times there? Thanks
6592294,Eckohlt,2021-08-24 08:29:00,3685,"Always leave early just in case,no fun being in a hurry to make a deadline.Besides that,better to be in Ontario early than hanging around the states."
6592386,djk50164,2021-08-24 14:27:00,370,The boarder besides the first day has not been busy. As other have posted in the past you can always watch this link to see what traffic is doing. https://travel.gc.ca/returning/border-times
