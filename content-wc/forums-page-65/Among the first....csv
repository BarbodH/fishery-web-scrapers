6591412,centralstater,2021-08-19 19:05:00,20,"Wondering what your quarantine plan was? Did you have to give specific names, locations, addresses? I am planning on camping on crown land so don't know what info I need to provide. Glad you had a terrific time."
6592188,HeHooksHimself,2021-08-23 20:22:00,725,"Our outfitter set aside a cabin in the camp as a designated quarantine spot. That was acceptable at the border.. Heading up next week for the second trip, this time to Wildewood on Savant Lake. I will post our experience. Hooks"
6592258,eyecatcher1,2021-08-24 06:41:00,323,"We crossed the border August 16 without a problem. 2 booths were open and there was one truck in front of me. Took maybe 5 minutes. The usual questions, plus a few health related questions. They also looked at our test results and covid vaccine cards. They also asked for the confirmation number from the travelcanada app. This was at 11:30 AM."
6592264,Larry S,2021-08-24 07:23:00,665,"My sister & I crossed the border at Pidgeon River Crossing on Thursday Aug 12th at noon. We were the only vehicle there Had a pleasant woman who took our Passports, Arrive can number, and then our covid test results . Looked at them for a bit asked typical questions upon entering Canada and waved us through in about 7 minutes. We flew to Duluth from Las Vegas ,rented a car and drove over the border ,Because if flying you need another covid test to reenter the US. Driving you donot need a test to reenter the US. No trouble coming back across the border Larry Schroeder"
6590510,HeHooksHimself,2021-08-15 19:34:00,725,"Dock and I were among the first Americans to cross the border since the Covid shut down. Here is our story The Prep: As we prepared for the trip, we tried to get our ducks in a row. To us, it seem to come down to four things: 1. Covid test within 72 hours of crossing. We each got two tests. The ones from Walgreens were promised within 24 hours. We took them and know we would have the results to show on our phones, but we went to another drive in operation that offered an expedited result (within 24 hours) for $50 extra dollars. Not knowing what to expect at the border and considering the possibility of a false positive, we decided to do that. We got our results within 24 hours and were able to print them to hard copy. The results from Walgreens arrived on our phones through email on Sunday 2. We each filled out our ArriveCan app on Saturday and it was relatively easy. Believe me, I am no tech wizard and I found it quite user friendly. The most important thing is the vax card, and the app makes it easy to snap a picture of it and load it. The border agent is able to look up your info since the app asks for your passport number. 3. Quarantine plan- Be careful how you explain this. If you leave any ambiguous areas you will be questioned and asked to explain it. Keep it simple. 4. Typical crossing questions will be asked. Amount of alchohol, tobacco, etc. In our case, we put in our potential arrival time as 1:00 a.m. When we arrived in I Falls (at about 10:15 p.m. Sunday night) we filled up our gas tank and decided to look at the situation at the crossing before we found a place to take a nap. We saw that they had the road blocked off at Hwy 53 and a line had formed down 53 to the east for about 1/4 to half a mile. We decided to get in line right them. They took the barrier down right at midnight and we crawled along until the line stopped right at the tracks before turning off of the highway. From there we moved about 50 feet each 15 minutes or so. We turned off the engine in between moves. Of course the toll booth was open, it is 8 bucks these days. It was 3:45 a.m. when we were done with our 15 minutes at the booth. There were only two booths open of the available four and there were plenty of agents there, but I will not speculate.... After the border: From that point we made our way to the 502. Be careful, we saw a couple OPP along the way. As usual, when we got to the Ojibway turnoff just after the entrance to Century Lodge we turned to cross the reservation short cut. Along the way there was a stop sign and a tent. We stopped a little apprehensive as to what the was all about. The native there asked us for our names and phone number. Some of you might remember the ""booth"" erected on HWY 11 one year. I remembered it so I asked him why he was asking me these questions. He said it is a reservation and it is just part of the job. I asked again why would you want my phone number? And he finally said just forget it. When we arrived to another booth through town we just gave him a fake phone number. As it turns out, this is not at scam. The government is requiring that every business get the name and phone number of every patron in order to be able to contact trace. The natives just didn't give us any explanation but that is the purpose if you are surprised by it. Most Canadians take their covid very seriously so be sure to have you mask ready. We got breakfast in Ear Falls and had a mask on until we sat down and had to provide our names and phone number. The week at camp- We met our camp owner at the dock and he took the two of us and another father/son to initiate the camp for 2021. The trip in was slow and arduous because the water was extremely low. At Wine Lake Camp we are used to access to five lakes and other portage opportunities, but this year it was Wine Lake only. Access to the other lakes was not possible. Well, no problem. We caught hundreds of walleye. It was fish after fish with the only exception when we decided to go cast for smallmouth. We didn't catch a lot of big ones, probably 25 over 20"", it was like 17-18"" walleye were factory stamped! It was incredible. Crossing back over the border- 30 seconds, a few laughs and we were home. We did notice there was no back up at the Canada crossing and all four booths were open. We have another trip in early September ( 2 1/2 weeks!) and I will let you know how it goes! Fish On! Hooks"

6590534,rather-be-fishin,2021-08-15 23:14:00,429,Thanks for the report! Glad you had a successful trip. Heading to Lac Seul on 8/27 & packing has begun!!! RBF ‚ù§Ô∏èüé£üá®üá¶
6590536,pjshorthorn,2021-08-16 03:34:00,5654,Glad ya had a good trip sir. Looking forward to a couple of games at ND this fall. Maybe we can share a few beverages on the steps of your old office for old times sake. PjShorthorn
6590542,jsmyers,2021-08-16 06:15:00,198,"Glad you had a good trip! Thank you for the details on your border experience.I'll be making a similar journey on 9/10 for my second trip to Wine Lake Camp. I'm mostly packed and organized (not a small feat when the group is all traveling from the SE). Now I just have to say away from COVID for the next 25 days!I'm curious if the rain in the forecast for the coming week will result in higher water levels on the Cedar and the Anishinabi. According to wunderground, there's about 2.5"" predicted by 8/25.IIRC, you usually go to Wine in June, so you don't have a lot of late summer experience to compare to?"
6590550,Bill Krejca,2021-08-16 06:41:00,6107,"So for your return trip, you will have to repeat the entrance procedure, or do you anticipated a different approach? Bill"
6590560,Eckohlt,2021-08-16 07:05:00,3685,"I'm doing 2 trips this fall,I would imagine it will be same oh same oh for both crossings,I'm not 100% on that though."
6590568,HeHooksHimself,2021-08-16 07:32:00,725,"Pat, looking forward to some normalcy this football season and Irish are in the top ten! If we can make it happen I am buying."
6590570,HeHooksHimself,2021-08-16 07:37:00,725,"Hi Bill, It is my impression that the ArriveCan app must be filled out for each trip within 72 hours of crossing, which means a new covid test, .a new quarantine plan (different place) and a new picture of our vax cards. So it seems it will be a repeat. Fish On! Hooks"
6590580,pjshorthorn,2021-08-16 08:50:00,5654,Sent ya a PM. PjShorthorn
