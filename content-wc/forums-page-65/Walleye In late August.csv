6591492,MC24,2021-08-20 08:19:00,4,My group usually fishes Ontario in mid June. Any tips or techniques for walleye and northern fishing the end of August. Any info would be greatly appreciate. We are crossing the boarder today and fishing a 1500 acre shield lake with a couple small portage lakes In between Ft. Frances and Dryden. Added bonus is Lake Trout but have never fished for them. Thanks in advance!!! MC24

Find those humps that come up to 20 - 14feet of water or somewhere in that range. Make sure they are adjacent to deeper water and its always best if it is a serious of humps or reef and not some isolated stand alone structure. For what ever reason 18ft always seems to be that magic number for us this time of year.If you are not familiar with the lake this time of year pull out those bottom bouncers and start slowly working those areas over with crawlers or minnows I prefer shorter harnesses in the 24-36 in range. Some like them longer. As soon as you pass over an area with multiple pick ups. Anchor or Spot lock if conditions allow and start pitching jigs if its calm and not over deep you may get away with 1/8 ounce otherwise 1/4 should do you and enjoy. I find the fish will be much more podded up. Meaning if you are catching 15 in fish its likely the majority will be. Find a different pod, till you find what you want. My experience is the action may not be as fast but I certainly have seen it, but the fish tend to run a little larger when you get into the right group.Good luck."

Also found a bunch in 8-15 fow, some even in bays. They are scattered. Rather than live bait which was insanely $$ we used a nose hooked b-fishn pulsr or moxi with a Colorado blade. That worked well. Once we found them we spot locked. In the rocky lakes I have found fish hard to mark on sonar for some reason this time of the year, even with fancy down/side imaging. If there were 2 marks there were 10+ fish and many times catching with no marks. Size was down for us but fun regardless. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro"

Several guys told me that it was a great time to fish with the fish being shallow and fattening up for winter. The trip fell through. Bad advice?"
6593616,gordy28,2021-08-30 08:48:00,437,"My group always makes our trips in the 3rd week of August For the most part we spend our time fishing a mix of mid lake structures (humps, sunken islands, shoals), points and islands Typically we search good looking structure with bottom bouncers and worm harness. Starting at the deepest point near the structure and moving up. If we hit fish at a consistent depth or spot on the structure we will throw out a marker or put in a waypoint and go back and jig with grubs tipped w a worm. The other area that we have done well with is fishing inflows and outflows especially where this is strong current We have never really had to fish âtoo deepâ. I would say our best depth at this time of year is between 10 and 20 feet Cheers Andrew"
6593764,Pymbet,2021-08-30 19:54:00,42,"The recommendations above are spot on. We just got back this morning and during the day we found most walleye in structure almost exactly as described above. Trolled very slow crawler harnesses in deep water that we never finished on our June and late September trips to find them. Located a deeper hole next to a ridge that got up to about 12 feet and found most walleye in the 20 foot water. Late in the day, say about an hour before sunset we still got them in normal locations close to shore but near the deep holes. The lake we fished is on the small side. It's a couple miles long by about a half mile wide. We didn't have a thermometer, but the water was very warm."
