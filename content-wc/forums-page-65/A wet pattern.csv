6593340,Eckohlt,2021-08-29 07:11:00,3685,What do you waterproof with that?
6593350,prov1800,2021-08-29 07:32:00,5010,Just get some frogg toggs and get it over with
6593354,jimirjr,2021-08-29 07:57:00,1149,"I use it on shoes, hats, pants, just about any cloth items I wear in the boat..."
6593364,Eckohlt,2021-08-29 08:15:00,3685,"I'm sure you already know they already sell all that stuff waterproof,no need to spray anything,just saying.Good luck on your trip"
6593368,Obabikon,2021-08-29 08:18:00,2370,"I buy a new pair of gortex tennis shoes each year. That's my favorite thing. Rubber boots are too slick when walking on wet docks and in wet boats. The grip and comfort is worth $100/year. I have also gone away from the expensive rain gear. I like it, but $40 frogg toggs are hard to beat. I buy a new set every year, and they're light, and comfortable to fish in."
6593380,prov1800,2021-08-29 09:00:00,5010,Pays to get good outdoor gear.I use Keen Low ankle hikers and have a high set thats insulated with 200 gram for later into fall and have had them for years now and have the high end frogg toggs.I spend a lot of time on the water and like to be comfortable in all situations.Late fall fishing I get into my Artic Shield hunting gear good to -30.

6593150,Bill Krejca,2021-08-28 06:27:00,6107,Good! Bill
6593152,pjshorthorn,2021-08-28 06:29:00,5654,I've caught as many big fish on days that were flat out pouring vs. days with no rain. I like fishing in the rain as long as my arse doesn't get wet.... PjShorthorn
6593158,prov1800,2021-08-28 07:20:00,5010,Hate fishing in the rain and wind.Give me the heat and calm.Way more relaxing.Fishing is good in both situations.We only get 3 months of summer to enjoy.
6593166,Obabikon,2021-08-28 07:40:00,2370,"fishing in the rain can be great. Wind always stinks... not that it hurts the fishing, hurts the fisherman. We are desperate for lots of rain though... so, it's great!"
6593172,prov1800,2021-08-28 07:54:00,5010,Poured in the VB area pretty good yesterday and last night.The rain is always welcome at times like this.
6593184,Eckohlt,2021-08-28 08:19:00,3685,Give me rain sleet snow and cold but no wind.hate the heat.
6593190,Pooch,2021-08-28 08:22:00,4618,"Rain overnight on Lake Savant. Still overcast light mist. Not as much wind as the past seven days. Temperatures are cool. Wind has been a factor most of the past seven days. Most of the time fishing in the wind was catching fish. Fishing slower than expected, but enough to keep us interested. Fish are really scattered and in general belly on the bottom. Not marking any obvious fish, but usually catching a few of them. Small fire in the wood burner to take the chill off this morning. Most cabins seem in no hurry to go out though it's not too bad of a day. Unsettled weather has fish catching requiring a little more effort. Pooch"
6593194,prov1800,2021-08-28 08:34:00,5010,"Make yourself a verticÄºe lindy rig with a 3"" face minnow.Has been best for me catching those walleyes laying on the bottom.My old lowrance hds8 has a hard time picking them off the bottom but my down scan on my hook 7 does a much better job.I spot lock on my waypoints and still catch fish even without seeing them and catch them.lol.Seems best in 23 ft.I only spend a hour or so fishing walleye after casting for muskies and its been fast even at 3 pm."
6593208,walleyecheek,2021-08-28 09:08:00,2231,at least the fire bans have been lifted.
