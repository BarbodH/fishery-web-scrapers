6592180,troutwater,2021-08-23 19:58:00,299,I've been really interested in this camp for a while. Todd seems like a great dude every time I've talked to him at sport shows. Did you notice less traffic around his camp compared to other parts of LOTW?
6592360,Stevetheoitdoorsman,2021-08-24 12:03:00,5,Yea definitely less pressure than other parts of the lake ive been to in the past.

Very little traffic in his area... probably one of the quietist spots on all of Lake of the Woods. He runs a great camp, and it is very hard to get into. There's a reason. People who visit Tamarack rebook immediately. 5 million gold stars for Tamarack Wilderness Lodge! (If thinking about it, book it and enjoy)"

I just got back from a great experience on the west end of the lake, fishing between the crow rock/shammis island area to north and south as far as dead broke. We caught lots of fish but the size was so so. Biggest fish 21 inches but most probably 15 inches. Tried shallow to deep, cranks, spinners, leadcore, you name it. I've been wondering if the Canadian eyes head towards the big water in the southern half this time of year? Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro"
6592444,Obabikon,2021-08-24 20:43:00,2370,"I do not believe that the walleyes do lengthy migrations. Probably just bad luck to not get at least one 25""+... it happens everywhere."
6592486,LOWrider,2021-08-25 06:34:00,40,"Agree with that. The best words of wisdom I've heard about Walleye fishing on LOW is that it's about when much more than where. I've done some strange things trying to find a consistent bite at times of year you wouldn't think necessary - the big fish are out there, not always predictable though. As an example one of our best summer spots literally only a mile from Tamarack was barren last week - not a single bite. Yet one of our spots that usually produces fall and spring was loaded with big fish. Can't speak to the precise areas Oldlund is mentioning but have fished Outer Bay / Big Narrows a lot and have found much the same."
