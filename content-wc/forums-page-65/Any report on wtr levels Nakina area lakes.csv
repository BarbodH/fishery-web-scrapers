6591922,halfmoon007,2021-08-22 14:44:00,121,I figured they were low.
6592302,Da' Walleye Assassun,2021-08-24 08:52:00,358,Whiteclay Lake is over five feet down from normal. Stay in the river channel or you will hit sand. A boat is used for carryiing gear from a raft to the dock. Fish the white rock on the Ogoki River for walleyes. Try the rapids on the river for walleye. Go directly up the center of the rapids and the current will hold your boat still. Have fun.

6592584,halfmoon007,2021-08-25 14:32:00,121,Is it lack of rainfall or are they drawing wtr off for power generation. Probably both ?
6592594,Eckohlt,2021-08-25 15:32:00,3685,Did you lose any jigs there?
