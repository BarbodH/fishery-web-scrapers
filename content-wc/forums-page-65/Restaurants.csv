6592314,stjoeguy,2021-08-24 09:19:00,979,"The three places we ate last week, McDonalds in Dryden, Wellington in Sioux Lookout and Pelican Lake Sandwich in Sioux Lookout, were all take-out only."
6592380,Mojo-NC,2021-08-24 13:39:00,1929,"We're staying the night in Kenora in a few weeks prior to our fly-in trip in Ear Falls. I was told by the person at the front desk at the hotel where we'll be staying that the restaurants are all still on lock down and are serving carry-out only. I'm not sure if this varies from town to town, but I suspect not. Does that sound accurate from you guys who have recently visited Kenora, Dryden, or Ear Falls in NW Ontario?"
6592430,Skywagon,2021-08-24 19:28:00,1106,"In Dryden the Patricia Inn, Best Western and Curling Club have sit down at lunch and dinner (supper). The Riverside Lodge is open for dinner (supper) only. Those are the ones I know about, seems most are pushing carry out. One thing to keep in mind is that here in Ontario you must wear a mask when going into a business or restaurant."
6592588,valley366,2021-08-25 15:05:00,193,I know its not Dryden but just listing this for reference only as it may vary between establishments. I called the Boston Pizza in Fort Frances inquiring about policy as that is normally where we eat. They are allowing indoor dining and patio dining. And a bonus due to some of the seating restrictions they are taking and recommending reservations.Hope this is helpful. Recommend calling around to see what the policy is where you intend to stop.

6592930,Fisherman Ted,2021-08-27 08:27:00,461,"Not true. The restaurants in Kenora are all open. I have been eating indoors for several weeks, and on patios for at least a lot longer than that. -FT"
6592934,Mojo-NC,2021-08-27 08:39:00,1929,Good to know. Thanks for the update. We were looking forward to eating dinner and having a few beers at LOTW Brewing Company upon our arrival in Kenora.

Luckily a group was leaving as we got there, so we only had to wait a few minutes as they were very accomodating to us. Next morning we ate at the diner on the East side of FF overlooking rainy. Great breakfast food and we also had to put our contact info down for contact tracing."
