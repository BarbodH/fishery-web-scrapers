Or the lakes it connects to in that area? And how do you pronounce ""Ignace""? Just a long ""a"". Hate to sound like a tourist. Thanks Mike"

I crossed it on the way home on Saturday and it is as low as I can remember seeing it in 40 years. Even at regular levels it can be rock strewn. I did not see much activity at Cozy camp where 599 and the English cross they did have some smaller camp boats at the docks so must be expecting some activity. Great fishing but she will be a minefield more so than usual right now. I don't think anyone really cares how you pronounce Ignace. But I can tell you the local Canadians that I hang out with all pronounce it as IG - Nace, where Nace is prounced like Mace with an N sound. None locals call is Ig nus. Locals call it Ig - Nace. Good luck"
6593636,grindstone,2021-08-30 10:09:00,201,I've fished the upper English River area specifically Shikag Lake and the connecting water but never below the rapids and pull through at it's outlet to the west as it makes it's way to Snowden. Missed the last two years but the 15 years have been Valhalla.
