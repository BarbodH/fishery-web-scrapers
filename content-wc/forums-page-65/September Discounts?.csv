Need a boat. Decent cabin. Like the red lake/gullrock area but open. Might be only 4-5 days...in on sat...out on thursday maybe? 500.00 to 600.00 for the camp? Trying to see if i can fit in a quick trip this year as i was not smart and did not plan on the border being open...so my pain is self chosen!!! haha. Looking for a needle in a haystack maybe.

6592094,valley366,2021-08-23 11:46:00,193,Give Ian a call at Five Lakes Lodge. He had openings last I talked to him. He is located on Gullrock. Drive to camp. Nice cabins. 2 different options on boats. Cook your own meals. Am sure he would be flexible on days.https://fivelakeslodge.com/
