Asked to see passport, asked to see negative Covid screening. Asked usual questions and we were on our way. No random tests given. Very low number of boats heading north, we pretty much had the road to ourselves. All in all one of our better crossings. Did not ask for vaccination hard copies. Did ask if we had completed ArriveCAN, but did not ask to see hard copy receipt."
6591758,RichA$1970,2021-08-21 16:54:00,1159,We are going through next Saturday morning around 0300. Anything open near there at that time as we are heading to Savant.
6591820,kettyspanky,2021-08-22 04:09:00,271,Good to hear guided fishing. Now go get em.
6591826,guidedfishing,2021-08-22 05:34:00,531,"RichAt 0300 I doubt there will be anything open. I made sandwiches and had them for lunch. Stopped at ESSO station in Ignace to top off with diesel fuel. The bathrooms were closed. Other than one stop just before Upsula to change out a trailer tire that looked like some of the belts must of broke that was the extent of our travels, just outside Savant Lake now. 61 degrees when we pulled in yesterday afternoon.There we’re almost zero boats heading north. We saw a fair number heading home. I was honestly shocked how quiet the border was at 9am on a Saturday morning!!We are the only ones in camp except for a young Canadian couple from Manitoba."
6591828,RichA$1970,2021-08-22 05:53:00,1159,Thanks and we’ll have a cooler of food and drinks and there’s plenty of “natural” bathrooms if needed. We are taking our time driving up but both agreed no need to sit around waiting to leave at 6pm when let’s just hit the road when we are up and ready. What lake ar camp are you fishing out of?
6592006,guidedfishing,2021-08-22 21:35:00,531,Rich We are on Sturgeon and we absolutely smacked the lake Trout and Walleyes today. Just beautiful our.
6592028,Pooch,2021-08-23 05:46:00,4618,Last two fuels stops are Grand Portage (about nine miles south of the border) and might still be one about a quarter mile before reaching the border. There is next to nothing from TB to Ignace to Savant. Take whatever you need with you. Places that were there pre-Covid are gone. Ignace has a Subway (no restrooms) I think opens at 8 AM? Fuel in Ignace if a station is open. There is fuel south of Savant at one station at Silver Dollar which is just like a remote truck stop. Limited facilities. There are no public restrooms open anywhere in Ignace. Plan accordingly! I'll PM you as I lost your email. Pooch
6592958,Remi,2021-08-27 09:50:00,41,"Anyone know if the gas stations are open in Kakabeka Falls? Also, the gas station in Upsala was another we used to stop at. Past years we fished the Silver Dollar area."
6593648,guidedfishing,2021-08-30 11:01:00,531,"yes gas/fuel stations open all locations, no issues. Bathrooms open in Upsala not in Ignace, mask required to enter."
