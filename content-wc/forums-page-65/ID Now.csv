6592110,valley366,2021-08-23 13:45:00,193,We are scheduled for the test at Walgreens on Wed. Looks like they open the appointments about 72 hours in advance.With any luck we will be crossing Friday early afternoon.
6592540,C182P,2021-08-25 09:40:00,59,Just checked on Walgreens website and couldn't see a single ID NOW test available in the next 2 days in all of MN and NW wisconsin. Been a real run on them.
6592566,Eagle1,2021-08-25 11:36:00,28,"I was able to schedule the ID Now test on Monday for this morning in Wausau, Wisc. Took the test at 9:45am and received the ""Negative"" result at 9:59am via email."
6592582,Baseline,2021-08-25 14:15:00,3207,Go the MN State Covid Website and schedule a test with them. They have testing centers all over MN . I used them two weeks ago and results were back with in 24 hours.
6592586,valley366,2021-08-25 14:58:00,193,My 2 kids went to one Walgreens this morning and were done with the test in 5 minutes. I went to another and was done in 10. Kids results were back within 30 minutes mine back in about an hour.Like posted above Walgreens releases appointments about 48-72 hours out. I looked on Sunday and appointments available for Tuesday. None of those matched up with our 3PM expected time at border for Friday. Went back on Monday and Wednesday appointments were wide open.Have the PDF on my phone and printed copies in the truck ready to go.Friday at 3PM will have feedback on what they say at the border. Will try post update from the hotel that night.

6591862,mms3rd,2021-08-22 08:19:00,148,There have been many people using it successfully as they posted here. I don't leave for a month.....probably be out of everything by then.
6591866,Jimmy Mac,2021-08-22 08:31:00,96,"I used the Walgreen's ID Now Test and crossed the border at Pigeon River last week. No issues.. I got my results e-mailed to me about 2 hours after I took the test. In the email message I got outlining my test results, you get an option of two different reports. I printed the ""Lab PDF"" Report and brought it with me. I showed it to the border agent along with my passport and proof of vaccination. It was really slick.. Have a great time....Those fish in Canada were very hungry and plentiful! Good Luck! Jimmy Mac"
