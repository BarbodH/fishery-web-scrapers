1313842,Sutsgold,2011-06-02 08:54:00,219,"I am going to travel for first time from Hudson up near the chamberlain narrows area. Will this take me throught the ""rags"" How will I know when I am there (besides my lower unit knocking off) What else do I have to worry about? Thanks. Cant wait to go!"
1313848,Walleye_Wrangler,2011-06-02 09:07:00,138,You'll know when you go through a narrow gap full of trees sticking out of the water.
1313879,jswinter40,2011-06-02 10:13:00,127,"you go thru manitou rapids and go to the left, there will be a ""light/white marker"" called manitou light. going north (not west to Devils Elbow) there will be a stump field. there will be a somewhat clear ""path"" on the south side of the stump field that you can pass through when the water is high enough.Are you going with someone who has been there? Kind of tuff to navigate that far even with a GPS without prior knowledge. BE CAREFULL! Are you staying in Chamberlain at lac Seul outposts? they will show you if so."
1313921,Sutsgold,2011-06-02 11:39:00,219,I was actually just going to make a day trip on up there. We are staying south of there and was hoping for a little adventure.
1313931,jswinter40,2011-06-02 12:17:00,127,I got a good idea for you Sutsgold. Andersons lodge guides up to that area everyday. I beleive Ben Beattie here on WC is one of them. They have Silver deep V boats with blue sun tops. They head out from the Lost island Lodge general area at about 7:30 every morning. You could follow them.
1313963,BenBeattie,2011-06-02 13:50:00,232,"The rags should be the least of your worries on the trip from Hudson to Chamberlian. There is lots of water in the rags, I've been running it wide open for over a week. It's a long run to chamberlian with many reefs that aren't on the map. Get a map with the main channel marked on it and follow it closely. Even then, hopefully your sonar reeds as speed... pay close attention. GPS is a good idea too. There are red/green buoys on the way up... keep in mind that the direction of flow in Lac Seul changes at Taylor island, and therefore the red/green buoys are switched from taylor north. I'd suggest stopping at bear narrows (@ 10 miles closer then chamberlain) and fishing that area. Lots of spots around there to keep you busy and great fishing. What time of year are you going? Just a FYI, I guide at Moosehorn Lodge (not Andersons) and do freelance trips as well. Let me know if you've got any other questions, I'd be happy to help ya out. Cheers,Ben"
1313967,jswinter40,2011-06-02 13:57:00,127,"thanks Ben for jumping in there. I know if I hadn't had somebody experienced in Lac Seul with me on the drive to Taylors the first few times, it would have been an intimidating adventure. many dangerous rocks and reefs beyond Taylor Island not to mention the reef leading into Bear Narrows."
