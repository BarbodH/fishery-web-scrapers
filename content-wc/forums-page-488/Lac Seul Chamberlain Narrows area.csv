1313707,rnnonmt,2011-06-01 23:06:00,992,Hi WC-er'sBeen fishing Lac Seul North East (Merrit/Wapesi/Birch) section for 15 years plus with the same group of guys the 1st week of June and now going the 2nd/3rd week of June. This is the 3rd year for my 11 year old son and I going together and we are going to be staying at Lac Seul Outposts in Chamberlain Narrows for the first time. Based on the ice out anwater temp/spawn I gather that the fish will be out of the shallows and finding their deeper water homes by then. I Personally have never fished south of Chamberlain Narrows. Looking for suggestested areas around and south of Chamberlain Narrows. I have a GPS/downscan and detailed maps. Looking for specific areas/names/gps coordinates of this area that produce. Of course I would share the NE section of hotspots I have found worthy over the years in return.

I would think that you should not have to move far from your normal haunts. Fish should be on the move south but many will be near their spring homes. If I were you i wouldn't go any farther south than 3 sisters area or just north of Bear narrows. i wouldn't overthink it too much. a little deeper, windy points, right in Chamberlain should be good, all things to keep in mind. good luck."

There are the old standby's of 3 Sisters, Skidoo point, the island on the east as you pass Bear Narrows from the south and those that Robbins can point you at. Oh ya, Scaler lake at the rapids is kind of fun but you need traffic signals sometimes. Over the years we have tended to avoid these places because of traffic except, darn, you do catch alot in them. I have in the past prepared some maps and info on places that are generally ignored and have served us well. Have had good feedback from others I have passed them on to. I sent you a PM this AM if you want this stuff. Do not know if can attach stuff to PM's or not so rely on email."

We take a trip with the guys in June(leaving Sunday) and then go again with the wives in July. You don't have to go far from the camp itself to get quality fish(26's, 27's, and 28's) and numbers, also. Chamberlain Narrows itself, Little Chamberlain, Three Sisters, Snowmobile Point, and Bear Narrows are all good but sometimes there can be some boats around. Put on a jig and minnow or jig and crawler, and just fish any island or point or bay with some wind action and find them. We find fish in 5-25 feet of water both in June and July. The staff at the camp will give you lots of options, but there are a ton more. Birch Narrows and Wapesi aren't that far a run from the camp, but you don't have to go that far."
