1311605,tv4fish,2011-05-26 14:26:00,2694,"Q. What if I donâ€™t live in Canada, but boat there? A. Non-residents only need to obtain a Pleasure Craft Operator Card if they are operating their powered boats in Canadian waters for more than 45 consecutive days or if the boat they are operating is registered or licensed in Canada (this includes rented boats). Boater Education Cards or equivalent certifications are recognized in Canada. Proper identification should be kept on board at all times to provide proof of residency. Q. What if I rent a powerboat or PWC?A. Currently, a Pleasure Craft Operator Card is not required in order to operate a rented watercraft. Instead, it is sufficient for a renter to complete a rental safety checklist. Take note however that some companies have made it their corporate policy to require renters to have their Pleasure Craft Operator CardHUH --- I'm sorry - this rule/law makes no sense to me -- It sounds like they're trying to have safe boaters running boats - they think I know how to run my boat safely for 44 days, but one day more and I have to be ""trained"" to be safe !! !(I know, I know - they HAVE to draw the line somewhere)OR - If I rent a boat they assume I know how to properly operate a boat (even though I may NEVER have run one before) and therefore don't need any safety training."
1311732,JinxCanada,2011-05-26 20:08:00,1306,"There's no comparison to Canadians getting screwed with this rediculous law. If anything FOREIGNERS (ie/ Americans) should need a licence before we do. Instead, we give them cart blanche to do whatever they want while WE are expected to follow the rules? Give me a break. Plus, I'm sorry but the relality is if you are a convicted criminal why the **** would we want you here??? The same rule applies for Canadians trying to enter the USA btw. I don't hear you complaining about that now do I?"
1311759,v-bay gord,2011-05-26 21:14:00,3168,"O.K.......my first impression is correct. Your attitude to those south of us....or as you would refer to them, as FOREIGNERS, seems apparent to me. I am a proud Canadian and can rant and rave about the folks to the south with the best of them........but I am not given the mission to refuse them entry, or otherwise harass them at the border. Sorry, but I don't buy the arguement that someone with two dui's is a criminal that deserves to be refused entry to this country. Your attitude is what needs to be reviewed. Why you are on a website that is all about U.S. citizens coming to Canada to fish is beyond me. The process at our border for many U.S. citizens wanting to fish in Canada is totally stupid.....if you agree with the extra ""punishment"" we seem to want to dish out, then you need to ask yourself what you are really accomplishing at the border. So far I have not seen the ""crime wave of minor criminality Americans running amok in Ontario"" dimish. But what I have seen is business's in the NW suffer from the stupidity.......so, while I don't agree with the boating regs, and could possibly agree with your position, coming from you I find your arguement somewhat irritating .........."
1311773,Moondog,2011-05-26 22:00:00,362,"I am now in Canada but not before another great border encounter. Coming back in to the USA we get ""profiled"" because we have a camper with a refrigerator so therefore we are smuggling 3rd world country citrus into the United States via camper. Oh yeah........Canada gets a lot of lemons from Afghanistan. Last year I asked the ""agricultural specialist"" if her time wouldn't be better spent looking in my underwear for C4, but then I digress. We have been coming to Canada to fish since??? They know who we are, they have already done a background check on us umpteen times yet we were searched entering Canada as usual. We refer to this as our annual ransacking. This time the officers were obviously interesting in just looking at our new motor home. So nothing is new...........we just plan to be at both borders an hour while people look for something they know we don't have. come on."
1311777,NWwalleye,2011-05-26 22:08:00,223,"Gord,I don't total agree with you on the BS and harassment that non residents are getting at the border .. Yes, it might hurt local business in the area .. I think that strip searching a vehicle looking for oranges is not needed. Rightfully wrong by the Boarder crossing official .. This person needs to remember what the purpose of their job is. But we must remember, that all the checks are necessary to insure that the hard core criminal or illegal substances don't get onto Canadian soil. Someone with 2 DUI's / DWI's is not a hard core criminal, as we think.. But, he is a repeat offender !!! And a Criminal by the Canadian Criminal Code ... Right or Wrong ???? Who is to say that he doesn't have few too many in Canada, let's say in Vermilion Bay (remember he is on a vacation).. He drives down the road and takes out someone you know . Would our attitude change towards letting a repeat offender into V. Bay .. Yes it would, I think ..The person with a insignificant crime, that happened many, many years ago.. Should have the knowledge by now, that they will be turned around at the border..It is common knowledge by all that read newspapers , watch TV or are part of a fishing forum .. THE WORD IS OUT !!!They should / could have taken the steps needed to be granted a pardon and permission into Canada, prior to the annual trip to Canada . https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...ad.php?t=76838I would have to do the same, if I had done a crime, that the US Government / Homeland Security classified as a non allowable offense .I am sure of that ..Just my thought ... This thread originally was started about the boaters card .. So here is my 2 cents about that .. Hey Guy's and Gals. Canadians have had to either challenge the Boaters exam or take the Boater course, then write the test, at cost out of our pockets .. I don't think that you will get much sympathy from Canadian residents, when all you have to do is take 5 minute check list ( at NO COST ) and BAM, you are authorized to drive a boat on Canadian waters .. I drive my boat and Lodge boats on local water at least 70 days a summer, I consider myself very proficient at boat handling.. I need to be, as I guide for many Lodges in the area ..I had to take a Test and get a Boater Cards. Is it fair for the non-resident to do a 5 minute check list (not a 2 day course + Test), that only drives a boat 5 - 7 days a year on their annual Canada fishing Trip, can be considered competent to handle a boat on Canadian water.. Sound fair to you , I THINK NOT !!!"
1311965,JinxCanada,2011-05-27 14:13:00,1306,I agree this is about the boaters card...and it's rediculous. as for the DUI stuff and other criminality...this is not a new law. This law has been in place forever and has been enforced forever and is not about to change. The same rules apply to Canadians trying to go to the USA. Criminals are not wanted. The sad thing is the cavalier attitude most (yes Americans) have towards drinking and driving. It's still consider a nothing offence which blows my mind. I think this probably relates to the American attitude in general (sorry to offend) that they can do whatever they want whenever they want where ever they want. You have no right to come to Canada...as I have no right to go to the USA. If you don't like or respect our laws as a sovereign nation then I suggest fishing trips to Italy or somewhere else.
1313540,cast_and_blast,2011-06-01 14:49:00,1098,"I was just at Rainy Lake and we stopped at the duty free before we crossed. Outside was a guy sitting with his suitcase. I wandered out and chatted with him and he had been turned back at the border and his buddies had proceeded (with his truck!) and he was waiting for cab to take him wherever he was going to catch a ride home. He was bummed out, but said he didn't know anything about the law regarding DUI's and crossing the border. From our conversation it sounded like it was 3 or 4 years old. Tough lesson. Scott"
1313736,JinxCanada,2011-06-02 05:21:00,1306,"statistics can be made to show anything man. it's easy. a percentage is not the same as the number of cases or the number of arrests/convinctions. Where's your stats on that? The number of US Fatalities according to your statistics is 10 TIMES the number of that in Canada. Yes we have a much smaller population and as such the percentage is slightly higher, but that means nothing. And I never said it wasn't a problem here either. However....we as Canadians OBVIOUSLY take it more seriously as a culture since it is a FEDERAL CRIMINAL OFFENCE here....and often just a slap on the wrist in the USA. Care to comment on that one? First offence here can land you 5 years in Prison. check all your facts.As I have no time to read it I'm curious why you didn't also include the same information about the USA statistics such as amount of money lost to property damage etc there? I'm betting it's HUGE...and the percentage of deaths etc of minors in the USA. Feel free to add to your post. See how easily statistics can be used to show almost anyone's point of view? Compare apples to apples please. ALSO...please don't try to start telling me Canada has the same type of DRUG problem as the USA does. You are the worlds NUMBER ONE CONSUMER of Illegal Narcotics.

1313790,Obabikon,2011-06-02 07:25:00,2370,"Jinx, Maybe it's just small town police, but I know a TON of people in towns close to me who have been pulled over (drunk). And either had their keys taken away from them, or were followed home. NOT having been given a ticket. In the states, I know one person who got out of a DUI and that was after going to court. The serious of the crime in Canada, makes the OPP give out fewer. I""m 100% sure of this. There is definately a drinking and driving PROBLEM in both countries, by both of it's ctizens."
1313815,J-Man,2011-06-02 07:53:00,191,"Does anyone have any stats on the average sentences for those convicted of driving under the influence? Particularly first time offenders?The maximum penalties for most offences are a joke. We did an exercise to study sentencing in high school in 1995 that would have made your head spin. Actual sentences for major convictions were pathetic and that hasnt changed as past history is the guide used for sentences. Many tougher sentences applied are rdecuded considerably an appeal to provincial supreme courts as they are outside the usual trends. Conditional sentences (available for any ""non-violent"" crime when seteneces are less than 2 years) are often used, which keeps people out of jail completely. When you add in almost guaranteed full parole at 1/3 time served and likely day parole after 1/6 time served, very little time is actually spent in jail on some of these offences with serious maximum penalties.I'm all for having serious consequences for many offences, but don't use a maxium penalty as evidence that we in Canada are tough on certain offences. That type of arguement will likely leave us looking a bit hypocritical. The ""minor criminality"" issue that has been a plague to the tourism industry in the last many years is a result of the classification of offences with these harsh maximum penalties that are rarely, if ever, doled out. It seems to appear that potential visitors to Canada are being held to a much higher standard than our own citizens in terms of how an offence if viewed. This is what can/should be addressed. Many of these offences could be downgraded in classification from indictable (felony) to at least hybrid (either/or depending on the facts), if not summary conviction (misdemeanor) if stats can show that severe penalties are almost non-existant for many criminal convictions. Especally when celebrities with colourful criminal pasts come enter the country freely to make public appearances, put on concerts and book speaking engagements. It's time for the double standard to stop, but there is very little political will/upside for this kind of issue so it will likely remain an albatross for many business operators for years to come."

Its not even a comparison with the level of inforcement that the States now employ. Not to mention the sure number of officers the US employs as compared to Canada. (at least NW Ontario that I have witnessed). you have no idea how easy it is to get the DUI in the US. 0.08 is a very small amount. so basically you can not have any alcohol while out with your spouse for dinner and drive back home. it has really come to that.Your are right Jinxy, US Citizens love drunks and drugs. yep, life in the US is just one big TV episode. get off your high horse dude, people in the US take Drunk driving every bit as serious as Canandians. maybe not you, but I don't buy the general public has a greater concern because the concern is very high."

1313521,cast_and_blast,2011-06-01 13:46:00,1098,"Ok, straight from the MADD Canada site...CANADA It was estimated that 8,103 Canadians died in 2002 due to alcohol consumption (p. 2), accounting for 6.15% of total mortality among those under the age of 70 (p. 93). In 2006, alcohol and/or drugs were involved in 1,278 traffic fatalities, 75,374 injuries and 163,893 property-damage-only crashes (p. 10). The total financial and social costs of these losses were estimated to be as high as $12.8 billion (p. 12).UNITED STATES From 2001 to 2005, an average of 95,695 Americans died annually due to alcohol consumption. Alcohol-involved traffic crashes were the most frequently cited cause, accounting for 14.4% of the fatalities. Using these numbers (above) it can be shown that: 1. Assuming that fatalities remained somewhat static from 2002 to 2006 (probably would have gone up due to increasing Canadian population, but we'll work with what we have), it's approxiamtely 15.7% of the traffic fatalities in Canada had alcohol/drugs involved. 2. As shown for the United States, it's 14.4% of the fatalities (on average from 2001 to 2005) had alcohol involved. So, assuming that these numbers remain somewhat static from 2001 to today it seems like it's Canadians that have a slightly higher rate of fatalities due to drunk/impaired driving, not the Americans. Given, these are stats gathered by MADD. But, assuming they are directionally correct I think we can dispense with Jinx's theory of the ""cavalier attitude of MOST Americans"" towards drunk driving. Still too high and too many tragedies, but it's even a higher percentage in Canada!
