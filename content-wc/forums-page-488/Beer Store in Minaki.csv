1312503,Jahloaf,2011-05-29 17:35:00,74,"Several years ago we were able to buy beer at the small grocery store in Minaki, then two years ago when we went there to buy beer the store was closed, cant remember the name. Does anybody know if you can buy case beer in Minaki?"
1312710,Jahloaf,2011-05-30 15:11:00,74,so 77 people have viewed and no body knows if there is a place to buy beer in Minaki?
1312733,teddi,2011-05-30 15:58:00,349,there is no place to buy beer in minaki
1312742,hogridnfool,2011-05-30 16:33:00,349,Try this....http://www.lcbo.com/lcbo-ear/jsp/storequery.jsp It's the website for the Liquor Control Board of Ontario's store search function.
1312768,Guest,2011-05-30 17:27:00,0,best to stop in Kenora prior to Minaki. The old store has been converted into boat storage/rooms. Option #2 is the Lodge/bar at Paradise Cove. http://www.paradisecoveminaki.com/
1312954,Danny61,2011-05-31 09:09:00,42,No beer in Minaki but you can take a day to fish the south part of the river and drive up to the keewatin boat launch the liquor store is only a 10 minute walk from the dock. the drive from minaki to kenora is 45 minutes to an hour by boat its only 35 to 40 minutes.
1312967,Iowa Farm Boy,2011-05-31 09:43:00,44,Maybe you should spend more time worrying about fishing then where you are going to get your next beer!
1313041,Guest,2011-05-31 12:25:00,0,"Maybe he's not worried about where he's gona get the next beer. I think he was asking if there was a place to get beer in Minaki. Maybe he was planning ahead so he didn't need to ""worry"" about beer. jeesh"
1313070,Jack77,2011-05-31 13:24:00,168,I have seen some ridiculous posts on this forum but this one takes the cake. A guy asks where he can find some beer you come out with this! Maybe you should spend more time worrying about not judging people based on a simple question.
1313090,Iowa Farm Boy,2011-05-31 14:03:00,44,Jahloaf has been my fishing partner for over 20 years. I was just busting his balls a bit.
