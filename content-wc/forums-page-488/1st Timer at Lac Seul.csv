1313205,trapsht,2011-05-31 19:13:00,28,I've been scouring this site for many months trying to absorb as much info as possible for Lac Seul. I'm a Lac Seul virgin heading up next week and staying at Timberlane. I'm hoping the resort owners will point me in the right direction...but who knows sometimes. I've been to other resorts where the owners are horrible fishermen. Could anyone give me a little direction with either a post or pm. Was also wondering if smallmouth are worth chasing?
1313219,wallydave,2011-05-31 19:49:00,2151,"I have fished the west end of LS for several trips, check with the camp owner, they will try to put you on the fish. Saw Mill, Lunker point, the mouth of the river, the entrance to the Sanctuary, are good spots. Wind blown points can produce! I have never caught any smallies, but never tried either. I will be at Goose Bay starting June 4th! See you on the water!"
1313251,KTroller,2011-05-31 20:55:00,237,"Trap, what dates will you be at Timberlane? We're headed there arriving Saturday 6/4. Chris the camp manager or Vance, the owner will give you a few spots to hit and will draw some routes on a map for you. If you need help just ask them, they'll get you started. They're very willing to help out. This will be our 6th year up there and every year it seems we find a new hotspot or two so you just have to be willing to move around a bit until you find the fish. If you're there at the same time as us, a gift of a beer to any of the guys in my group might get you some spots too As far as smallies go, we don't target them much but catch a few each year. The walleye fishing is so good and various techniques work so if we get tired of one thing we just try something new for fun. Jigs, plastics, cranks, rigs, slip bobbers and trolling are all worth a shot. First tip is for free since it is your first year and it is just one word... Pink KT"

The Smallie population has really grown in the last 10 years. We cast small cranks and small v spinners on rocky shores that have some wind. You can expect Smallies in the 14"" to 20"" size. Good Luck and have a safe trip. Mike Kansas"

I have found fishing in McKenzie is the best water on the huge lake. We used to stay up in Ear Falls area and found staying in Rat Bay is best because the boat ride to McKenzie is shorter."
1313936,alanexpup,2011-06-02 12:30:00,278,"we always did good in the sactuary area, at the falls and sawmill. the only trouble is if the wind is blowing down the lake then we stay around the lodges. the train trestle area was good and trolling down the shore by the tree stumps. even in the little area by evergreen had fish in it."
