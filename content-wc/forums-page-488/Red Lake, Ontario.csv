The fishing was a little slow but then picked up when the weather turned around. Woke up Tuesday morning to snow and also fished in the snow. Fish kept getting bigger as the week went on and the pike were also on the walleye more. Ended up catching a bunch of fish over 20"" and yes the big one did get away. We went to Gull Rock for a afternoon and I had a eye psuhing 30"" get off right at the boat. Over all it was a great trip and can't wait to get back and do it again. Hopefully in August"
1313015,Blue Fin,2011-05-31 11:32:00,47,"Heading up to Gull Rock on the 10th. Can't stop thinking about the trip and I have been ""checked out"" from work for the past few weeks. Too bad that big one got away. Where did you last see it again? Also, what did you have the best luck on for walleyes?"
1313148,tikka_t3,2011-05-31 16:03:00,14,I am headed to RedLake on Friday will probably fish on Red Lake for the most part as I am staying at Sunset lodge. I heard the fishing has been decent but the weather has been a challenge.
1313236,tackleman,2011-05-31 20:25:00,444,just heard on the radio that a fellow from the states drown in Red Lake last week. He fell out of the boat and the 2 others with him couldn't get to him in time. He wasn't wearing his life preserver.Please be careful and wear those preservers. We like you to come and visit us but we also want you to go home to your loved ones.

Later in the week white was working. By the end of the week we were catching 100 eyes a day.Tackle man- the guy that died was fishing up in east bay. We were fishing in the narrows and saw the police boat come by. I think that he was staying a Howy bay. sad sad He was only 55 years old. There were some big waves and the resort boats aren't the bigggest. you are right wear your life jackets."

1313406,Blue Fin,2011-06-01 08:54:00,47,"Thanks for the info on Gull Rock Marc. Too bad on the accident. I don't like hearing stuff like that but it happens every year. Did you have much luck in the boot? Also, we will be up there one week later this year so we will have the opportunity to fish the northern bay (sanctuary) past 3 sisters after the 15th. Has anyone every had much luck up there? Any part of the bay that we should focus on?"
