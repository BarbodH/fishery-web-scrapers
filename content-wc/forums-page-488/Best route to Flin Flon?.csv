1312099,tlee,2011-05-28 05:39:00,65,Thank you I do know how to use google. I guess I was looking for some specific info from.someone who has driven up there.
1312108,GBS,2011-05-28 06:48:00,2271,"We traveled there from Winipeg a few years ago - trip up was from Winipeg north, and then jog over west at the top. Return trip was the second route above, using MB-10 . The first was great roads, barely any civilization. Very far apart gas stations, almost no food stops at all. The MB-10 route was also a great road and had enough more stops possible that it didn't feel like you should have thought of a jerry can or two.....and is was pretty scenic to boot. Can't speak to the western route shown above, it appears more direct. Do a check for services along the route you end up planning. Stops for gas can become very far apart."
1312140,Thor29,2011-05-28 08:06:00,36,"i'd go straight north to the Saskatchewan border, get on highway 35 and take it north to nipawin. from there head west to smeaton, turn on highway 106 and it will take you to creighton. turn left at the end of main and it will take you to right down town Flin Flon. If you stay on the main road, it will take you around on the primeter and out towards Bakers Narrows. Miss all the hills that way."
1312197,Dacotah Eye,2011-05-28 11:56:00,2722,"I cross at Dunseith, ND and take highway 10 all the way to Flin Flon. Pretty nice highway all the way."
1312363,oldblue2008,2011-05-29 08:31:00,313,"I would go to Regina, either through Estevan port or Regway, and then take #6 to Melfort and then up to Smeaton, as Thor said, and continue on up the Hanson Lake road to FF. The road up to Nipawin was not in real great shape as compared to #6. It is the same distance going thru Melfort and better road. Roads in southern Sask have really taken a beating this spring with the high water tables and large amounts of rain.."
1312375,Fitzy,2011-05-29 08:51:00,121,"I agree with these directions....the number 6 highway is great (boring to drive) but good pulling a trailer. The #6 highway takes you to choiceland...head west another 15 miles to smeaton and continue north on the Hanson Lake highway to Flin Flon. If you have extra time...there are lots of little lakes with Brown, Rainbows, Splake, Brookies on the Hanson lake Highway (i.e Seeley, Shannon)."
1312383,Bill Krejca,2011-05-29 09:18:00,6107,"I haven't visited the area for quite a while, but agree on the trout lakes. In particular, check out ""The Gem Lakes"", beautiful different colored waters having a variety of trout species, also Piprelle (sp?)Lake for large rainbows. The Hanson Lake road in this area was gravel, and subject to washouts, perhaps has been improved by now. If not, you have to weight the fishing advantages vs good driving. Bill Krejca"
