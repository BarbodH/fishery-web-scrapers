1312714,Pooch,2011-05-30 15:24:00,4619,We are normally headed north and stay in Thunder Bay before going into camp the next day. There are numerous small tourist towns between Duluth and Pigeon River. Most hotels are booked early and it can be hard to find anything on short notice. Route 61 from Duluth to the border is a busy road until you get with thirty miles of the border.A couple decent sized towns that come to mind would be Two Harbors and Grande Marea (SP). Tow Harbors has a lot of services and a really nice grocery store on the north side of Rt. 61 just before the RR underpass.Get on Google Earth and follow Rt. 61 from Duluth to the border and you should see numerous places to stay. Just book early.Pooch
1312754,guidedfishing,2011-05-30 16:55:00,531,"Stu,Are you headed west on 11/17 once you get across the border?Depending on your timing Grand Marais, MN has multiple motel opportunities, This is just a little less than 1hr short of the border at Grand portage / Pigeon river. We have stayed at the Motel 8 several times in Grand Marais, nothing fancy but usually fairly reasonable. If heading west Kakabeka Falls has some limited opportunities, this is about 1.5 hrs further past Grand Marais depending on border crossing time.There are some other places between Kakabeka, Upsala, and Ignace but you need to make sure you are dialed in ahead of time. Don't expect to roll in late and find someone. Most of these places do not keep the front desk open to late at night. Motel 8 in Grand Marais is usually closed by midnight unless you make arrangements with them. Same for the rooms in Ignace, if your coming in late coordinate with the motel they all have some system to leave a key for late arrivals in place.And just as a reminder if your going west don't waste time going into Thunder Bay, Save yourself 30 miles and take the 130 cutoff road that comes in just east of Kakabeka falls.Two Harbors is only about 30 mins north of Duluth, the North shore always seems to be a pain for deer from Two harbors north at night, Then the trip from Kakabeka to Ignace at night can fun dodging swamp donkeys so just be alert traveling these stretchs after dark.From the border to Ignace you can figure around 5.5 hrs approx depending on road conditions / road constructions etc.If your not head west then I sure there are some folks that can help you that are more familiar with whats available north of Thunder baygood luckGF"

It has changed hands, But seemed good 2010. This year we are trying Kakabeka Falls Motel, just to clear the boarder on Friday. This is a little late to start looking. Good Luck. God Bless."
1312899,Catman59,2011-05-31 04:36:00,345,"We spend 10 days at camp so we usually leave late Friday afternoon and head home . Its nice to get the 5 -6 hours of Canada driving behind me, then head home early Saturday. We usually stay at the Casino in Grand Portage. This year it will be $135 which is not much more than The Grand Marais motels. The food is spendy , but good . The Casino is fun , but still a casino. Good luck."
1312928,Stu,2011-05-31 07:30:00,472,"Thanks for all your in put. Guided Fishging, we are heading to Press Lake near Ignace, but this trip is for 2012. I'm just trying to get my ducks in order and I'm jonesing since I can't go this year. We usually stay in Int. Falls and I really like that town. I was hoping to find a similar place, it sounds like we'll try Grand Marais."
1313161,guidedfishing,2011-05-31 16:57:00,531,"Stu, More times than not we just drive straight thru from west central WI, If given the opportunity I try and plan extra time for an overnight. On occasion we will leave after everyone is done with work in the evening that puts us nicely into Grand Marais for the evening. With a early get up we can usually be fishing by noon the next day. It must be a solid 10+ hr drive to KC to Grand Marais, go idea on laying up there. Been a long time since I fished Press, it will be a good time. Try and plan your trip to travel the North Shore in the day light, It's a beautiful drive and should be enjoyed. Any questions let me know. good luck GF"
1313371,camp chef,2011-06-01 07:51:00,915,I agree make sure you plan the north shore drive during the daylight. Grand Marais will make International Falls look like a paper mill town to you.........Oh yeah....it is....LOL.
