1313909,Hammerhead Herb,2011-06-02 11:12:00,259,Couple of quick questions? 1. What is the cost for crossing the bridge from IF to Ft. Frances? 2. I understand that there are multi trip passes for the bridge that cost less than paying for a single trip; we have about 6 to 7 cars that cross the bridge each year. Any truth to that? Thanx ahead of time for any info.

I have bought them at the Safeway store in Fort Francis and at the grocery store at the International Mall (where Menards is) in International Falls. I have also bought them at the gas station just outside of I Falls.......it might be Rogers Corner...a Conoco station? It is definately the way to go. My BIG BEEF with the bridge is that they don't advertise this option, neither do they sell them. In other words they rip you off. I have twice asked to buy a card at the booth and when told they didn't sell them drove off without paying. Lately I have just bought the card as my wife keeps telling me I will get in trouble................. The card is only good for one year...which is another rip off......... By the way.....if you have vehicles following you, you can swipe the card to pay for them as well. Not sure how they handle the trailor....probably have to swipe it twice.."
