1313774,wallydave,2011-06-02 07:03:00,2151,"Skywagon, the forecast for cen. Il the day we leave is in the low 90's! One of the great things about the trip North is the cooler weather! The forecast for next week looks pretty good, 60-70s Less than 23 hours before we leave! I'm trusting the border guards won't let us bring the hot weather North!"
