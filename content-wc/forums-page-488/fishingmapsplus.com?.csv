1311250,kansasity,2011-05-25 16:57:00,80,"Ok, it's been a week and a half and have no map yet. I'm kinda beginning to wonder. I ended up calling him Thurs night and he said he had mailed it that day. So I expect yesterday being a holiday here maybe get it today or tomorrow?"
1313156,adempsey,2011-05-31 16:47:00,963,"Ordered my map on May 19, 2011, was stamped at the post office on May 24, 2011 and received in the mail today May 31, 2011.Unfortunately I believe there is going to be a postal strike on June 2, so hopefully your map will have reached the border before then.Cheers!"
1313166,kansasity,2011-05-31 17:15:00,80,"Still no map yet, maybe tomorrow. I would say it's probably is in the U.S. by now if he mailed it Thurs."
1313579,kansasity,2011-06-01 17:08:00,80,"I received my map today, not as detailed as I expected, but still better than what I had. It does show depths and it is laminated. All the tips it gives is common knowledge stuff."
1309368,kansasity,2011-05-20 10:34:00,80,"Has anyone ever ordered a map from this place? If so, how are they?"
1309385,nd89sc88,2011-05-20 11:01:00,92,"I have not ordered from them, but I have ordered from Canada Map Sales . com and Track Maps. com recently. I liked the maps I got from Track Maps better, but they were more expensive . . . each one the shipping was high, coming from Canada. Bill"
1309391,adempsey,2011-05-20 11:21:00,963,"I actually just ordered a map from there yesterday. The maps seem alright, but the lake map I wanted was nowhere else to be found so it was my only option. I think they seem a bit pricey for what you get. I have also ordered maps from Trak Maps and Canada Map Sales. I agree that the Trak Maps are one of the best available for printed maps. I wasn't overly impressed with the Canada Map Sales map, but again, sometimes it's good enough and better than nothing.Anyway, I can let you know when I receive it.What lake are you looking for?"
1309393,kansasity,2011-05-20 11:26:00,80,"We are going to Lount lake, it's on the English river system, Separation lake flows into it. I sent a money order Monday, so hopefully I will receive it next week sometime. I called and talked to him, he basicly read the map to me and answered all my questions. We are going the first week of September."
1309399,retire55,2011-05-20 11:33:00,1029,"For anyone interested in bathymetric maps for lakes in the Abitibi-TÃ©miscamingue region of north west Quebec, many of them are available on-line free of charge at http://www.mrn.gouv.qc.ca/abitibi-te...ymetriques.jsp"
1309418,kansasity,2011-05-20 12:22:00,80,"Let me know how long it takes you to receive your map, did you order it online or mail off for it?"
1309508,JDP,2011-05-20 16:41:00,1457,"As good as any map for Lac Seul, not inexpensive and since they are from Canada they can get held up in customs. If you are needing a map quickly, I would not count on Trak Maps to be delivered in your time window (quickly to me is less than 2 weeks).Maybe things have changed since I ordered a year ago on-line."
1309515,adempsey,2011-05-20 16:53:00,963,"I emailed him my information and phoned in my CC number. I actually need to follow up since I haven't heard back from him.I also live in Canada, so the time it takes for me to receive it may not be comparable to someone in the US. I will let you know though."
