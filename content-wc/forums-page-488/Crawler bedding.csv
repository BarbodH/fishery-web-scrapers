I know dirt can't be used so I just thought about running some paper through my shredder and throwing them in with that, but that would be rather crude. Thanks."
1312990,rebs,2011-05-31 10:36:00,7587,"I use nothing but Magic Worm Bedding and food. I never had a problem and the crawlers do good in it, kept in a fridge at about 42 degrees."
1313009,adempsey,2011-05-31 11:16:00,963,"I use Frabill Fat and Sassy or Super Gro worm bedding. It's cheap and works well. It's basically shredded newspaper. F&S contains food and is ready right out of the box. SuperGro doesn't contain food and you have to add water (use water that sat overnight so the chlorine has dissipated, unless your municipality uses chloramine, then use some type of bottled water instead). I live in Canada so don't have to cross the border, but I don't think you should have problems doing so. I know they are both very popular beddings."
1313033,phishfearme,2011-05-31 12:04:00,1242,"but your thought to grind up newspapers in a chipper/shredder is pretty much exactly what the frabil people and others do - so i say go for it. when i did this routine many years ago i had to soak the newspaper in water - holding the paper verticle in the tub so the water gets in between every page. i had to dry mine by laying it out on the driveway but i think you can just make some a day or so before the trip, cool it then add crawlers. phish"
1313208,potatoefarmer,2011-05-31 19:17:00,6,"Shredded Paper works good. They last very well if you keep them cool. I had a buddy take care of worms for me once, that was the only time I was ever checked. They found a blade of grass, and I had to goback and dump the crawlers, with the thousands of others where the U.S. border folks told me to dump them. After that I took care of my own, I even wiped each one down. No more, Just buy them in Canada, Easy and sure. Good luck, and God Bless."
1313232,Wall@y@,2011-05-31 20:20:00,191,"My vote is for Frabill Fat & Sassy. I starting using it last summer and keep my nightcrawlers in a refer out in my unheated garage. I had about 20 crawlers left in the Fat & Sassy over the winter and figured I had lost them. When I got the courage to take a look earlier in May they were still ""Fat & Sassy."" With the food imbedded in the material the crawlers stay healthy and in great condition. I used mulched up paper before and even if I changed worm bedding the crawlers looked rather poorly after about a month in the worm bedding. The bedding I used was Buss Bedding."
1313248,Mike Borger,2011-05-31 20:42:00,1554,"It's funny, but I've never liked or had much luck with the Magic Worm bedding.It's too much like earth, too messy.As others have mentioned the ones made with shredded newsprint work great at least for me.Here in Canada the brand that's most readily available to me is Wonder Worm.I'll usually condition my worms first before packing them in bedding.Putting them in ice water in the fridge plumps them up nice and fat."
1313315,rebs,2011-06-01 05:15:00,7587,"the magic worm bedding I use is not like earth. If some gets spilled in the boat, it dries and blows out on the way home. No problems."
1313427,troutwater,2011-06-01 09:39:00,299,Thank you everyone for the suggestions. I've decided on the Frabill Fat and Sassy since it already has food in it.
1313548,Mike Borger,2011-06-01 15:07:00,1554,I know that but it's darker in color and sticks to your fingers when you're grabbing a worm just like earth.
