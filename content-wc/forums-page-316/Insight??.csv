I see they have a couple lakes that they fly to out of Nakina now so that may allow us to try them out in the future. It was too far of a drive for us to Armstrong where their main base is. Let me know if you decide to use them. We're always looking for different lakes and outfitters to try.

Professionally done. High price relative to many others in the area. Depends on what you are looking for re: is the extra $ worth it for you. Feel free to PM me any specific questions."
