2994266,bftiger,2014-07-14 11:38:00,21,"Starting in 2016 NO FISH BAIT (Dead minnows, frozen smelt etc) will be allowed to be used as bait in the entire Quebec province. Over a decade ago they banned the use of live minnows. Dead fish bait fishing still will be allowed for ice fishing. This will affect all of us who use dead bait for pike fishing in the spring or use dead minnows on jigs for walleyes.I was told this by my outfitter in Quebec. He said it is a done deal. I am waiting for more info to be published from the Quebec authorities."
2994282,SinOrSwim,2014-07-14 11:43:00,1528,"out of curiousity, why do they have those rules? Are live minnows a problem? And how can a dead minnow be an issue?"
2994338,Freytown,2014-07-14 11:56:00,770,"http://www.mddelcc.gouv.qc.ca/faune/...-appats-en.htmWhy Does Using Bait Fish Pose a Risk?The use of bait fish increases the risk of introducing harmful pathogens and organisms such as viruses, bacteria, parasites and aquatic invasive species (AIS) into our lakes and rivers. These pathogens and organisms can have a negative impact on the quality of water in our lakes and rivers as well as on fish populations and your fishing success. As an example, the introduction of the white sucker into lakes populated with brook trout has led to a decrease in brook trout catch (kg/ha) by sports fishermen/women of 40% to 60% (Magnan, P., Lapointe, M. and East, P. 1998). It should be noted that, in most cases, once introduced into an aquatic environment, a pathogen or aquatic species cannot be eliminated. On the contrary, such pathogen or species may eventually spread throughout the entire watershed concerned."
2994370,bftiger,2014-07-14 12:06:00,21,My question then would be why do they allow dead bait fishing for ice fishing?
