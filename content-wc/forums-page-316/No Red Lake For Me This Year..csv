Dave has some new guys with him this year and I know they will all have a great time and catch a bunch of nice fish. Thanks for the great time last year Dave and put the boys on the fish this year. Say Hi to the folks at Black Bear Lodge. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"

This was the earliest I had been at Red Lake as in previous years had been there from mid-July to mid-August. This year the fish were still in the East end-Chukuni River and East Bay. We used live minnows, crawlers and leeches. Crawlers worked best. The fish were still shallow as we caught walleyes as shallow as 5'. Water temp was 60-65F. Fishing was fair to good as we went through a number of cold fronts while we were there. Stable weather produced stable fishing."
