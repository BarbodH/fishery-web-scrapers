2999066,Freytown,2014-07-15 14:56:00,770,"Can you post the dates that each transaction happened? Currency rates change daily...even intra day. Theses are bank rates which the customer never will see: Mar 21 2014 1.1241 Jul 02 2014 1.0634 If you got credit early in the spring and paid the final bill in July, the conversion you experienced seems OK. I paid nearly 100% of my esti cost this year in the spring and locked in the good rate. Hope this helps. FT"
2999194,Jesse-WI,2014-07-15 15:30:00,534,Looks like a method to get a 5% premium on profit and use taxes and exchange rate as an excuse. Otherwise they need to fire their accountant as the extra money is going into someones pocket.
2994666,55walleyes,2014-07-14 13:24:00,131,My outfitter advertises their rates in American money. When billed it is converted to Canadian Funds and tax is then figured in and a total in Canadian funds is figured. That Canadian total is then converted back into American money to be paid. My question with this is that they are using 2 different rates and it is costing about an extra $90 per person. Is there a reason 2 different rates are used? Maybe an outfitter on this site can explain this?
2994930,GNO,2014-07-14 15:01:00,153,The banks buy and sell US $ at different rates. Not sure why your outfitter uses a Canadian funds credit card terminal when most of the Canadian banks offer them in US funds. If they are charging US $ this only makes sense. That way it simplifies using your credit card and you know exactly what you are being billed on your card.
2994970,octanehi5,2014-07-14 15:09:00,1104,"what yor money is worth depends on the exchange rate, This yr a $1000 AMERICAN was 1100$ canadian, they have to tax yo in canadian $,PST & GST then converting it back to american $ Taxes in Canada are very high, what yor exchange rate is very important"
2995266,Fisherman Ted,2014-07-14 16:11:00,461,This makes absolutely no sense. If you are quoted American $ and pay in American $ there is no reason to convert your bill to Canadian funds just to figure out HST and then have to convert it back!All that needs to be done is calculate the HST on the American dollar price you are charged and charge 13% accordingly. The reporting of HST can all be done on the back end (i.e. after the fact) by the operator by using one of several methods that CRA (i.e. IRS) will give the nod to. All the while the customer never sees a thing. By using 2 different rates that in the end causes you to pay extra money in my opinion you are getting ripped off (if you say that after the conversion you end up short).
2995706,v-bay gord,2014-07-14 18:19:00,3168,I would agree.
2996850,octanehi5,2014-07-15 04:54:00,1104,"All I have to say abot that ,$ 1000 american at 13% is $130 dollars, with a exchange rate of 10% the $1000 american becomes $1100 Canadian Times 13% is $143 CanadianThe govenment figres taxes in Canadian $ This is why they do it. like it or not"
2996866,3M TA3,2014-07-15 04:58:00,2846,Wow I missed the part about the credit cards. Where was that discussion?
2996890,3M TA3,2014-07-15 05:05:00,2846,This is true but using your figures 1130 US = 1243 Canadian. Bottom line is 13% is 13% (taxes). The only problem really is the math skills of the Outfitter.
2997122,Fisherman Ted,2014-07-15 06:22:00,461,"13% is 13%, plain and simple. No converting needs to be done at all to come up with the HST amount, especially not twice in the same transaction where you end up owing more than 13%. If the transaction starts and ends in US dollars it should be exactly 13% and a conversion/exchange rate has no bearing on the calculation.As an outfitter all we then need to do is take that revenue at the end of the quarter (calculated in US dollars at the time of sale) and adjust THAT amount to Canadian dollars and charge the 13% on THAT amount that is then submitted to CRA (IRS). That is typically done by averaging the exchange rate over the time period less the standard cut (or mark-up) of your financial institution and multiplying by the amount of revenue (that is subject to HST) brought in during the period. It is at that point where all revenue is adjusted (in either direction) and HST is calculated in Canadian funds (again, for outfitters that charge and collect in US $). Even if the exchange rate fluctuates over the quarter it doesn't matter as the revenue was collected in US funds and the money sent in for HST in Canadian $ will be adjusted later. In other words, you have US funds so the rate is immaterial until you make the quarterly calculation and finally pay the 13% to the government which should have no impact on the customer paying their bill."
2998930,55walleyes,2014-07-15 14:12:00,131,"Here are the numbers: $1,410 US was converted to $1,555 Canadian That is an exchange rate of 1.10283 Our groups final total in canadian funds is $7158.16. That total was converted to $6,844 US. That is an exchange rate of 1.04590 If original rate of 1.10283 was used then total in US would have been $6,490. That is a difference of $354 american dollars. Thoughts or explanations?"
