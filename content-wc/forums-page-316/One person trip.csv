2990625,pjshorthorn,2014-07-13 08:43:00,5654,"I've taken a few solo trips to the NE section of Lac Seul that I've fished many times over the years. It is definitely a different experience, but I've truly enjoyed those trips as there were zero schedule (s) to worry about and an extremely relaxing time on every trip. Safety is always the largest consideration for a person considering this type of trip. I'm very familiar with the areas that I fish, I don't go exploring new areas on my own and I file a float plan every day with the outfitter on the specific areas I plan to fish and the time a plan to be back throughout the day and early evening. Most times I'm less than a mile from camp every day and if I plan to fish in the evening it is within site of camp. I normally go up in late September as cabins tend to be readily available and I enjoy the colors changing and cooler weather. I'll be sure to make solo trips in the future when I need to completely ""unplug"" off the grid. Best of luck if you decide to venture out solo. PjShorthorn"
2991481,forgop,2014-07-13 13:14:00,880,Still have room for 1 Aug 9-16 due to health issues forcing 1 out. Thread on this board.
2991609,lenray,2014-07-13 14:17:00,467,"I usually go with one good hard working bud who can cook and carry a canoe etc. My basic point about lodge and going non-lodge was not written well by me. My point is that there is mighty good great fishing on many waters that can be reached by boat, canoe etc. and these waters do not see many if any others. Enjoyed the fun barbs also---don't have many friends--kinda like it that way.....................If a person is willing to drive many miles-put in a river with a 16 ft. boat pulling a 14 with a canoe on the back and going up or down maybe 15-20 miles then portage off the main water-----you can get into great waters without seeing others and catch many and big fish..........................................been doing it for many years. I have the bucks to fly anywhere---just prefer doing it this way. At 69 my days are numbered for this kind of difficult work.............."
2992865,bigcreekdad,2014-07-14 05:30:00,74,"I've been taking solo trips for years. The last 15 years on the French River. Five years ago, I drove 16 hours to Fireside Lodge near Sioux Lookout. Great trip, but that drive by yourself is a big drawback. I can hit the French in less than 8 hours. Solo trips...They are special. Used to take a trip or two a year with a group. My only companions now are my sons if they can go. Go for it....you will not regret it."
3000530,cruiseforever,2014-07-15 20:40:00,177,Thanks for the info. Still wondering when a resort would be open to a lone guest. A year out or would they roll the dice and prefer to book 4-6 weeks out to me when a booking for more would be harder to come by?
3003338,bobbylfishermon,2014-07-16 15:22:00,241,"Contact V-Bay Gord, he owns a camp."
3003722,bigcreekdad,2014-07-16 18:21:00,74,"I've had very few lodges ""ding"" you for solo. Most places I have stayed at in last 15 years or so have recurring solo guests. I might add, they all have a few gains that will only accommodate 2 guests max."
2982633,cruiseforever,2014-07-10 09:15:00,177,"Getting the itch to head North again. Keeps getting more difficult to get a group together. I am thinkiing I might try a solo trip in 2015. Looking on advice on the best way to find a place to stay. 1-Try to book as a solo this year? 2-Put in for vacation time at work and try to find a place a 2-4 weeks before I leave? I know lodges want 2 or more. But I am thinking they would take a single instead of an empty cabin. All I really need his dry place to sleep, shower, and and a stove. And of course good fishing. Thanks for any advice."
2982697,wallydave,2014-07-10 09:24:00,2151,"The solo trip question has been discussed before. If you looked at a late season trip, you might have better luck. The share a seat thread has helped me put a couple of trips together. Good luck!"
2982713,IaDave,2014-07-10 09:27:00,476,I have been on many solo trips- depending on where you go you won't have any problems finding a place except maybe for 3 weeks in June.
2982737,trapper_john,2014-07-10 09:31:00,83,"I would consider Kingfisher lodge on Wabaskang. We go up around the 4th of July and they usually have an empty cabin or two. They have one nice little cabin that sleeps two and that is almost always open. Great people, nice clean camp. We've been going there for years. (wife and I)"
2982769,bobbylfishermon,2014-07-10 09:42:00,241,"I'm like IowaDave, I go solo a couple of times a year, (after my wife goes in May,and she goes in September) but in between she cuts me loose in Canada. Most camps are booked solid for June-July, musky fishermen, family vacations etc. but after that, they almost always have a cabin open, and would love to fill it. One is a whole lot better than none, and I'm sure they would work with you."
2983041,Golden Eagle,2014-07-10 10:47:00,2642,Go for it. Good luck.
2985609,lenray,2014-07-11 08:20:00,467,Why use a Lodge-----In NW ONTARIO there are many roads that head off north and these roads cross rivers streams etc. Put in a decent size river and head up or down and come to a lake. I use one of those black bags you hang in a tree for a shower............I am 69 and still do this---this year was the only one on the water just like the last 14 years and caught over a dozen pike in the 40 in. plus size and the eyes were tooo numerous to count. No plane no lodge and no other fishermen......................just saying......................
2986553,v-bay gord,2014-07-11 12:45:00,3168,"......no friends..... (sorry, couldn't resist). One drawback I could see with that scenario is what to do in a semi-emergency, such as hooks in your face, a twisted ankle etc. Good on you though for doing it so long and surviving!"
2986585,MrSimon,2014-07-11 13:04:00,922,You can use a drive-to lodge as your base of operations for a very similar trip ..... and then at least someone knows to come look for you if you don't show up after a day or so.
2990449,derek204,2014-07-13 07:47:00,56,"x2 I Have done a solo trip up to Kingfisher the past two year and I tell ya, nothing is more relaxing I will continue to do it for years to come."
