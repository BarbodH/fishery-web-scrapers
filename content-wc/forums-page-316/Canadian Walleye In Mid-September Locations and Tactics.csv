2992697,Sportdog,2014-07-13 23:15:00,6735,Thinking about a Mid-September trip to a Canadian lake and wondered about walleye locations and tactics that time of year. So far all my trips across the border have been in Mid-June and the spawning river mouths and shallow bays were the ticket. Any information and tips would be appreciated. Thanks.
2992737,Guest,2014-07-13 23:50:00,0,We have been flying out of northern wilderness for the last 7 years in sept. Walleyes on salted minnows or crawlers behind spinners. 15 to 25 feet deep. Humps. drop-offs points.
2993129,BornToFish,2014-07-14 07:24:00,1224,"I fish a lake in NW Ontario for two weeks each September. Honestly, it's my favorite time to fish as there are fewer boats and no bugs. The weather can be the best of the best, or the worst of worst. You might encounter both types of weather in the same day. I've found that walleye fishing during September is about the opposite of fishing early season. My fishing during the early season revolves around covering water to find the fish as they move away from their spawning grounds. Walleye fishing in September centers around NOT covering water. I've found that the walleyes tend to be bunched up, most often around mid-lake rock humps and rocky points. I'm thinking ""game on!"" when I pull up to a rock hump and catch my first walleye as I then know where they all are. I'm thinking that I have a chance at catching every walleye on that hump. Walleyes start heading deep in mid-July on the lake that I fish. During August, when the lake is at peak water temperature, the walleyes seek the comfort of cooler water and are typically in narrow bands in the water column (e.g. 22-24 feet down). As the water cools in September, they often move deeper to seek more stable water temperature, but the band typically widens (e.g. 26-34 feet down) as the temperature gradient from surface to bottom isn't as striking. My fishing for walleyes in September is most often on the sides of off-shore rock humps. Vertical jigging is the name of the walleye game as it is my best way to always have the bait in the strike zone. Please note that the depth the fish are at may change during the course of the day. For example, the fish often move shallower on the rock hump as it gets closer to sundown. I believe that casting, trolling, drifting bottom bouncers and the like are great and proven techniques that catch walleyes, but are NOT presentations of choice during September. The lure is not in the strike zone very long, as the strike zone might not be any wider than the boat. As you fish, always be aware of the depth of water that you are fishing. You might not be catching any fish, when in reality they are only one or two boat lengths away in six feet deeper water. I've encountered many good anglers that are completely frustrated fishing in 30+ fow. It's out of their realm of experiences. They are unable to feel bottom and keep their bait in the strike zone. The number one challenge of most anglers in September is boat control. It often separates those that catch fish from those that don't. Good fishing and tight lines! Make some memories!!"
2993305,v-bay gord,2014-07-14 07:59:00,3168,I would agree with Born to Fish but I would also not discount a shallower bite that often occurs in mid to late September. In those cases some of the mid June spots will produce...especially drop off areas associated with mud flats. The bonus with the shallower bite is the better survival rate with released fish as opposed to bringing them out of +30 foot depths.
2993329,SinOrSwim,2014-07-14 08:08:00,1528,"Very good post, thank you. Boat control can be very challenging. Many in our group do not fish that much and you can tell after a morning of trying to control the boat you will get the random guy who basically just says screw it and you will look up and they are drifting in 60 feet of water. LOL"
2993577,BornToFish,2014-07-14 08:37:00,1224,"VermillionBay Gord - points very well taken. Thanks for the build upon comments. I know it risks hijacking the thread, but I wanted to mention that I use a light power rod when vertical jigging to ensure being able to find bottom with light jigs. By necessity, I tend to bring my fish up quite slowly. I seldom encounter floaters. They briskly swim away. I will have to pay more attention to the bite at the first drop off the mud flats. There must be a good reason for the big toothy girls being there! I've fished with many guests at my Lodge during September. Some folks catch on to boat control rather quickly. Some folks say ""not for me"" or something to that effect. They would rather fish for something else or with a different technique than work that hard to catch walleyes. I sense it comes down to personality type for vertical jigging in deep water. I can fish for hours and have the boat not move more than one or two boat lengths. It's a lot of effort to control the boat, but for me it's effort well spent. Other folks seem to prefer doing something else - less effort or more movement/motion. Most of these folks seem to find something else that works better for them. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
2993737,IaDave,2014-07-14 09:10:00,476,I'm with you on this. At the lake I fish in Sept I look for humps that come up to 30' or so and get as vertical as I can. Your anchor or spot lock is your friend in these conditions. Also- I try to find the largest minnows that I can.
2993889,Golden Eagle,2014-07-14 09:46:00,2642,"Moving water will hold walleyes. In hot weather, jig in cabbage. Humps and points should produce. Lots of solutions. Very few problems. You may not hit a super hot bite, but expect to find heavier than usual fish."
2996186,Sportdog,2014-07-14 19:51:00,6735,I have never fished deeper than 12 foot for walleyes. How do you find these deep fish? I won't have top notch electronics. I fish salmon and steelhead but those fish are usually found suspended in the water column. I'm assuming that the eyes will be bottom oriented.
2997786,fishron,2014-07-15 08:52:00,317,"We have an increasingly difficult challenge on a lake we've been fishing for more than twenty years. Not that big a lake, only a short drive over the TI border, a great natural walleye population, naturally clear water that now is gin clear due to zebra mussel infestation. Our success is usually tied to a good moderate wind that blows in the same direction for several days. We catch our fish on light jigs and crawlers in 15 to 30 ft of water depending on the time of day. If there's no wind........well we now always pack our golf clubs"
2998770,Mike Kansas,2014-07-15 13:34:00,1463,"On Lac Seul we have found Walleye at all depths in September. I always like to fish long island points or main lake humps at this time of year. I would say that the majority of Walleye we catch in Sept are 17' to 25' deep but if the wind is blowing and you have some chop on the water check out those windy spots with 8' to 20' of water. Wind seems to be the key for these spots and I think it is because the wind blows in the planceton and the minnows come to feed and the Walleye come to munch on the minnows. When you find baitfish on your electronics you will normally find the Walleye. Great time of the year to catch the big girls. Fish slow and remember the wind is the key and the electronics are your window to the Walleye world. Jig with minnow, crawler or leech can all be effective. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
3001722,Guest,2014-07-16 08:56:00,0,"BornToFish and Mike Kansas, Over time, you both have given excellent information and tips. Thank you. Boat control can be a little dicey on Lac Seul at times but equipment is far better than when I built my first makeshift set of backtrolling splashguards out of old canvas and junk steel I found on our farm at the age of 14. Dad threw them in the woods at the end of the week. If anyone finds them, I would like them back. I find that it also matters on the type of lake you are fishing. You are spot on for Lac Seul or a lake like it as far as depth and jigging presentation. However, on a lake which has the greatest depth of 25 ft., I find that I need to employ more movement over the water and a different presentation. Good luck to all who can make the trip to the greatest water in the world! Rocky Point"
3002322,BornToFish,2014-07-16 10:56:00,1224,"RockyPoint, It's great that you found our suggestions to be helpful. The techniques that I described work extremely well for me and others that I fish with. This does not mean that it will work for the next guy. Everyone has to find what will work best for them. I find that the back-trolling technique that I described works well for me until the waves start coming over the transom. It just gets to be too much work, plus I don't like getting wet. I'm fortunate to have fished my lake of choice enough to have learned spots over the entire lake. When the wind is blowing too hard, I just move to a more sheltered spot behind a different island or point. Good techniques can be used in dozens of different places. The techniques that I described were developed with Canadian Shield lakes in mind. The lake that you described might have some sort of structure (rock bars, reefs, humps, etc.) that could be holding fish in autumn. You might be able to scale up/down the concepts discussed and find them to work. They might be another arrow to keep in your quiver. Memories are out there to be made. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
2997138,BornToFish,2014-07-15 06:28:00,1224,"SportDog, I have the benefit of having fished dozens of weeks on a certain lake in NW Ontario. I have many things pretty well dialed in for August/September fishing. Experience is most helpful. If you are new to your lake, I strongly encourage you to make some friends with other anglers at the dock. Your lodge owner should give you some helpful pointers in terms of location of structure and depth the fish are at. Hiring a guide for your first day should be money well spent. The lake that I fish has three populations of walleyes most of the season - suspended, weeds and structure. I focus on the structure related fish. I use a high-end Humminbird unit. I occasionally see marks on my screen representing walleyes. I know they are there if I see them on the screen. However, I don't see most of the fish that I catch, as I catch way more fish than I see marks on the screen. I leave a place after I have searched it out with rod/reel rather than because the screen is blank. I will suggest a technique that I use daily. I pull up on a piece of structure (rock hump, reef, sand bar) and throw out a marker buoy. This buoy serves as a reference point so I don't lose the structure. I then start exploring the structure by SLOWLY backtrolling while vertical jigging. I focus on the depth that I caught them yesterday. In your case, information you glean from fellow anglers, guides or lodge owner will get you started. I may make a circle around the buoy. The key to this technique is to make deliberate changes in depth of water being fished. That is, GO SLOW! Changes in depth are made in one to two foot increments. My fishing line is nearly always vertical. The fish are normally within a foot of the bottom of the lake. A fishing line that isn't vertical may well be out of the strike zone. I put in a second marker buoy when I contact fish. I focus on the immediate area and beat them up until it's time to leave or the fish move on. They often go shallower as evening approaches or deeper when the sun moves higher in the sky. I use a light power fishing rod and a reel with six pound monofilament. This rod allows me to feel bottom with a 1/16 or 1/8 ounce jig, even in 30+ fow. I can't remember the last time that I used a 1/4 ounce jig or heavier. Good fishing and tight lines!! The memories are there to be made."
