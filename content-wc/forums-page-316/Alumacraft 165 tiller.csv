2987289,chris165,2014-07-11 18:32:00,128,"I just ordered a replacement 165 Competitor hull, no trailer or motor. Price was $9500+ taxes in CDN funds.Last year we purchased a brand new complete package with painted Eagle bunk trailer, 60hp Merc, 70lb V2 PD US2, Humminbird 386ci, Dufort cover, bicycle seat and it came with 3 batteries. $16250+ tax is what we paid.Hope those prices give you a base line.Looking forward to seeing how it looks in the blue and white in person , will also get the chance now to set up the boat a little bit differently."
2987473,Live to jig,2014-07-11 19:19:00,159,"Aspen, no that was taken on O'Sullivan Lake in Ontario, but there were some dandy eyes right out behind the boat!"
2987561,Aspencreek,2014-07-11 19:57:00,2911,"That sure looks a lot my shore lunch spot on LS, just across from the Honey Hole. Love slip bobbering with a leech while I set up the shore lunch, catch some of my biggest eyes right off shore."
2983913,bigcreekdad,2014-07-10 15:14:00,74,Toying with buying one. Does anyone have a feel for what I should be looking at paying for boat only? Looked at one at Cabelas with a boat only price of about $10500. Can't seem to find any pricing info on line.
2984753,Live to jig,2014-07-10 20:42:00,159,"Not sure of price but I can tell you that after fishing the 2nd year out of my brothers new boat in Canada, can't beat this rig"
2985049,Hot Runr Guy,2014-07-10 23:31:00,16061,"heck, I'd buy this one, sell the motor and trailer, and be WAY under 10K.http://wausau.craigslist.org/boa/4553141953.html HRG"
2985057,btmbncr,2014-07-11 00:41:00,492,"I've got a Alumacraft Navigator 165 Tiller,a 2012 model still wintierized in my boat garage.I only used it for 1 month last year.It has all the goodies,75 hp Yam 4 stroke,Terrova I-Pilot 80 lb,Humminbird 898 CI SI and a 858 HD,with Whitecap splash guards.If this is what you are looking for PM me.Bill"
2985233,MrSimon,2014-07-11 06:41:00,922,"Used boats are the way to go!!!! You get so much more for your money. It can take longer to find what you want, and you might have to drive quite a ways to get it .... but you'll be much better off."
2985545,davenathe,2014-07-11 08:07:00,113,That is great set up and a sweet boat. Have 2007 Nav 168 with 60 Yam and absolutely love. If had to guess price would be from 16 to 18k. As can get 2014 competitor 175 for under 21k.
2985761,MrSimon,2014-07-11 08:36:00,922,"For you guys with Alumacraft tillers .... do you find it hard to drive the boat and watch your electronics at the same time? It seems the fishfinder sits to the side and behind you a bit .... meaning you have to turn your head back and forth to see the finder and look ahead. Also, does the position of the chair mean you have to reach behind you a bit to hold the handle while driving down the lake? Can you tell I'm trying to decide between a tiller and a console? I've got my eyes on a new Voyageur 175!!"
2986001,Hot Runr Guy,2014-07-11 09:31:00,16061,"MrSimon, FWIW, here's a pic of my ""happy place"". If you get an OB with a 30"" or so long tiller handle, you won't have to reach back much at all. As far as the FF location, I'm using a RAM swing-arm mount, mounted off the forward edge of the storage box. Yes, you have to look down to see it, but I can't think of a better place to mount it, where it will be in your line-of-sight while driving. HRG"
2986145,Aspencreek,2014-07-11 10:10:00,2911,"BigCreek.....if the price is in line I'M going to give btmbncr a call and buy it if you don't. The navigator is wider, a little deeper and has all the comforts of home. That 75 yami is bulletproof and already has the goodies. I'm sure its going to be over 10K, but you can save yourself some $$$$ and have a really nice rig."
2986169,Aspencreek,2014-07-11 10:13:00,2911,Is that PIC on lac seul.....I think I have shore lunched there too! Caught a couple dandy Walleye slip bobbering from shore.
