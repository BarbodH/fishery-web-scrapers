2994162,Carnhzkr,2014-07-14 11:06:00,964,"My parents have been fishing this area since the mid-60s. They returned from their spring trip on June 20th and reported the water as high as they'd ever seen it. They had difficulty finding places to get out for shore lunch, as all of the granite outcroppings were covered and they had to eat back in the trees with the bugs, which were also reported to be as bad as they'd ever seen. Despite the high water, they had excellent fishing, although some of their usual spots were unfishable (e.g., below South Boundary Falls).You can see by the data on this site: http://www.lwcb.ca/waterflowdata.html that the water levels are still well above normal (check the links for Caribou Falls for water flowing into Tetu and Boundary Falls for water flowing out. It only makes sense that Tetu will be very high. This is where all of the water from Lac Seul, flowing down the English, meets with all of the water from Rainy and LOTW flowing down the Winnipeg. You'll catch fish, but you might need to adapt, as they probably won't not be in their usual spots"
