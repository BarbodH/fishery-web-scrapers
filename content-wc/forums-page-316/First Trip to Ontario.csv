2990649,bigtimeelectric,2014-07-13 08:52:00,174,"Reno, I would look into the morson area of lake of the woods lots of great resorts, close to home great fishing and well mapped. If you want to go further I would consider Hobbs resort in Manitoba awesome fishing reasonably priced as well. If you want to try lac Seul send me a pm and I will help you out best I can! You grandson is a lucky kid!!!"
2991513,Larry Mac,2014-07-13 13:29:00,530,"Hi Steve, What a great adventure you are about to share together. There are so many great destinations in Northwest Ontario to choose from. You have two great drive to lodges represented by two great contributors to this wonderful site. You have VBAYGord (Eagle Lake) and Obabikon (Lake of the woods). Both of these fine lodge owners will put you on the fish and make sure your adventure with your grandson is a memorable one. If these are not what you are looking for I would suggest Cedar Lake in Perrault Falls Ontario. It is a very user friendly lake that is easy to navigate and loaded with fish. Where ever you go you and your grandson will have a trip of a lifetime. Thank you,Larry Mac"
2991665,Cusack,2014-07-13 14:37:00,1,I'm new here and just returned from Morson yesterday.I've been staying at redwing lodge for 31 years it's a great place. Stay away from Mylie's Resort it's a dump. To much traffic he let's people launch for the day. While I was at Redwing which was full five guests called redwing from Mylie's trying to get a cabin. To me that says a mouthful. It's really just a rundown Trailer Park.

2992266,Glenman12,2014-07-13 19:08:00,762,"I'd second Larry Macs vote for Cedar Lake...smaller body of water (6500 acres) easy to fish, easy to navigate..trophy eyes and muskies..wherever you choose good luck.."
2992329,TinmanDon,2014-07-13 19:33:00,194,"Minaki.....Paradise Cove, you won't regret it....heading up there myself tomorrow for the week....BIG walleyes!!!"
2992689,ftfarms,2014-07-13 23:13:00,444,I would second the morson area and cedar lake love both areas.
2993369,LOW1,2014-07-14 08:12:00,2828,"It's a bit like being a kid in a candy store - so many good choices. How old is your grandson? Will he be happy fishing and hanging out with gramps for 18 hours a day all of the time or would it be best to have some other diversions for him? That to me would make a difference as to where to go. And decide if you want an American plan (meals included) or a housekeeping plan (just the cabin) and whether a flyin/boatin or drive to location is what you want. If the budget is no obstacle, a flyin would be cool. And evaluate the amount of seclusion that the various resorts have - some are very close to busy roads and some provide much more of a ""wilderness"" experience. Since your focus is on making memories, I'd steer towards an American plan resort. A flyin would be seriously cool also. (But hard to bring your own boat along) Let us know some more details as far as your objectives, concerns, and budget are and you will get more feedback. Congratulations on what you are trying to do - I think that you will have a marvelous time."
