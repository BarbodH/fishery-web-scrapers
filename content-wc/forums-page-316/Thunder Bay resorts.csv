Or, conversely, recommendations for American plan Walleye and pike? Smallmouth a bonus. I am looking for a second trip and want to explore some different water.. Thanks in advance"
2991105,waterwick,2014-07-13 11:02:00,32,I believe this is the only one out of Thunder Bay. I'm sure others may be of assistance.http://wildernessnorth.com/fishing-t...se-in-ontario/
2993017,Kwags,2014-07-14 06:45:00,48,Thanks Wick. Solopaddler had recently flown out of TB with another outfitter and I thought that there might be more. Do most of the resorts fly out of Armstrong and Nakina then?
2995698,waterwick,2014-07-14 18:18:00,32,Many fly out of the Armstrong area. Can't comment on Nakina. Never been there. Mattice Lake Outfitters is well respected. Have an enjoyable trip.
