Ive had my hand on several walleye, a few large pike, and a few big smallies. Wind finally drove us in today. Hope to make it over to LOTW tomorrow. http://img.tapatalk.com/d/14/07/07/ave9ype5.jpghttp://img.tapatalk.com/d/14/07/07/yga3u4yt.jpg"
2970329,Smallmouth Hunter,2014-07-06 20:21:00,84,Nice pics. I don't fish on Blindfold but usually fish the area near the portage. Is the water still flowing over the railway/portage system? First time I have ever seen that was this year. I can see from your pics that the water is high.
2970689,patricktjms,2014-07-07 05:03:00,67,No. The water is not rolling over the portage. LOTW is only about a foot below blindfold though.
2970753,deadhead1,2014-07-07 05:48:00,193,Good to hear you finally made it to Kenora. LOW has been very good as of late for walleye. I don't think they are fully on their summer humps yet but it seems you can get a few at almost any place you stop and jig. Depths from 15 to 40 feet with the bigger ones seem to be deeper. I have mostly concentrated on off islands drops and off mainland points. Mid lake humps are starting but still not concentrated. Lots of jumbo perch this year.

2987481,patricktjms,2014-07-11 19:20:00,67,A couple more pics. Fishing was up and down. Great when cloudy but if the sun got out you could forget it. I also caught a big pike via it biting onto a crappie that I was reeling in. That was awesome. http://img.tapatalk.com/d/14/07/12/ubysasys.jpghttp://img.tapatalk.com/d/14/07/12/ze3e4u9y.jpghttp://img.tapatalk.com/d/14/07/12/nu8yjene.jpg
