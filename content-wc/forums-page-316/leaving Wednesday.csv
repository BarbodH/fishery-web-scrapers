2902457,hoppy63,2014-06-16 09:36:00,367,Must not be popular place.....have had very few responses at all. Would surely had thought someone has been here or know someone who has. Anyway I hope that's not a bad thing! Will post report when I return.
2904369,luv2fishcanada,2014-06-16 17:20:00,41,Lots of critters in the ditches. Keep your eyes open. Was up that way last week. Saw numerous moose and bear during the day as we headed up.
2999554,hoppy63,2014-07-15 16:57:00,367,"Fished with chimo at Roderick 3rd week of June. Stayed at the pine island outpost. Accommodations were good except for grill was a charcoal grill and grate was almost non existent (we used rack out of oven). Motors ran fine, boats in good shape. So, no complaints. Took a couple days to find ""hotspots"" as none of us had ever been here nor could come up with any info. We mostly jigged with twister tails or gulp minnows and leaches. We did manage plenty of walleyes even in learning curve. We had no 100 fish days but caught plenty and ate like pigs. Biggest eyes were 26-1/2"" with many over 23. Biggest pike 33-1/2"" caught on jig, no leader ( we hardly targeted them). All in all was great trip and wish I were there now!"
