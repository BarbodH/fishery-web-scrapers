We as a group from 3 to 12 adults and children. We stay for 7-8 nights. We eat fish every day and have always brought home our limits. I could bring my fishing pole and knife and have everything else provided from to bathroom needs to grills to cook on and boats to fish and a/c in the cabins. There are so many hot for fish if we don't catch something in a short time off to the next spot to catch some. Calm lake is actually a reservoir so there are a lot of tree stumps ever where and lots of places to fish. The greatest memory I have of calm lake is the night my dad his friend and I fought 32 small mouths in just over an hours time. All of them 16 to 22 in. in length!!! Highly recommended !!!"
