2987457,walleye4life,2014-07-11 19:16:00,54,Looking for info on this lake. How was the fishing specifically?Never been there but wondering how it compares to Brennan and Wabakimi. Looks like its part of the same river system.
2987897,Pikeslayer8,2014-07-11 22:54:00,1460,I dropped in on this lake on our way to Wabakimi as the pilot needed to fix their pump. Nice camp and beautiful lake with some high cliffs on it. Don't know much about the fishing other than it's a NWO camp.... gotta be good!
2987969,Ogoki,2014-07-12 01:52:00,291,"I fished Granite three times . Once on a canoe trip and flew in twice to the cabin on the south end. First fly in we did pretty well. Second fly in was like the switch was turned off. Out of 38 fly ins , that was the worst. Armstrong Air was the outfitter at the time Mentioned to them how slow it was and I was stunned at his reply as he said "" I don't understand why that lake does that"". Was not long until he sold his camp there. A few years later we came thru Granite on a canoe trip . The falls at the outlet of Granite was excellent. The portage is river right. Did VERY WELL there for nice fat walleye and numbers too."

2989049,Ogoki,2014-07-12 16:11:00,291,"First time there was last week of August. Plenty of 17-19 inch walleye. Biggest northern was around 35 inches. My cousin and his wife wanted to do a fly in with us and didn't want a long flight from Armstrong so we went back. That time was late June . Wife and I went on a fly in , flew out ,met them and flew to Granite. The lake we came off of was fantastic so I thought my cousin and his wife were in for a real treat . We four worked just to eat walleye each night . I did get a 41 inch northern that trip. We were shocked because of the poor walleye bite . Late July another year we flew in west side of Granite and camped at the falls at the outlet . Caught tons of walleye in the fast water of the falls . Our pick up that trip was on Smoothrock. Moral of story . I know of places where I have done consistantly better and would not go back. If I canoed thru there again ( and I might) I would stay a couple days at the falls."
