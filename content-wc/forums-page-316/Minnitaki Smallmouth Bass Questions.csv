I am a bass fisherman at heart and hoping I can get some information on how we might be able to target some of the Smallmouth Bass in Minnitaki. Noone on the Bass boards knows much about the lake so I figured i would post here to the experts Hoping someone might be able to share some locations, baits, etc that I may be able to try and locate and do some Smallie fishing. Very much appreciate any advice you may be able to give!! Thanks!"
