I figure it'll be a good two weeks out of whack unless temperatures go way up and stay there....anything on smallies that time of year would be good as well if there's anything different about them in Lac Seul than in other places."
2970417,Fishin Fun,2014-07-06 20:50:00,218,"I'm also curious about the same thing. Colors, etc. Our group is going for the first time ever too during the first week in August. Luckily btmbcr is going to be at the same resort at the same time as our group and he's going to point us in the right direction."
2970929,BenBeattie,2014-07-07 07:06:00,232,"Things may be a little behind but they are progressing as they should. By early August, fish will be exactly where they should be for that time of year. Already fish are on main lake structure. I've been catching good numbers of walleye on humps etc. in the main lake basin in 25-35 FOW for over a week now. By August there will be more fish on main lake structure as some walleye are still in shallow water patterns eating mayfly nymphs. Jigging with minnows is hard to beat. It's simple and very effective. Scan structure with your graph, mark fish then position your boat over top of them (anchor, trolling motor, backtrolling, etc.). It you're in search mode bottom bouncers with minnows or crawlers on a harness also work. Colorsâ€¦ I maintain that it doesn't really matter. Anything from Lead (unpainted) to bright (glow, chart, orange, pink, white) to dark (black, brown, blue, purple) all work."
2972497,Aspencreek,2014-07-07 14:28:00,2911,"At that time of year I would concentrate on weed lines on 12-14' and mid-lake humps, points, an drop offs. I do a lot of bottom bouncing with in-line spinner rigs with leeches, crawlers and minnows. When I find good numbers I will jig or slip bobber, even tried drop shotting (something new). You can also try pulling a floating rapala behind a bottom bouncer, got some of my biggest fish this way (I remove the belly treble).Don't get too hung up on color this time of year, one day they will only hit white, the next pink, the next yellow, etc. etc. At least that's what it will seem like. When you get to the dock at night ask some of the other guys what they are doing, sharing intel is part of the fun, at least it should be!"
2973241,geomax,2014-07-07 17:33:00,29,"Likely both humps and weed lines will produce lots of fish, but if you want the hogs in higher numbers I would tape a GPS to Ben and then work 27 feet of water within a 50 yard radius of his boat. JK on the GPS and 27' specifically, but you get my drift.Although I did fish Tuk Bay a few years back and hammer some nice overs in 8 foot of water when the wind was pounding straight into an island directly off the main channel, with the moon full and my fingers crossed etc.....but the humps will be key to increasing the odds of landing the master anglers"
