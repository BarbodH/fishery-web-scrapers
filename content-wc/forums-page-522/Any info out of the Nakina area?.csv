I have fished this area before and love to fish walleye. Any tips on big pike this time of year also greatly appreciated."

The fishing was very good and it rained every day except one while we were there two weeks ago. A few tips I picked up at Wollaston Lake while I was there four weeks ago to catch pike: Mann's 1- (the big one), in-line spinners like a Mepps or Blue Fox in the 4 or 5 size, Rat-L-Traps or similar bait, and the safety pin style spinnerbait, look for the ones with the wire twisted completely closed where you hook your line, and don't forget a titanium or steel leader. Cast to weeds in 2-15 feet of water. I have also found that pike will inhabit the same weedbed but not in close proximity to each other. In other words I have never encountered a ""school"" of pike (they're loners). Good luck and have a great time."
