I have been on about 15 trips to Lac Seul,5 to Rainy as well as a couple in Manitoba and once to Cliff Lake........but I have never been this late in the year and kinda want to try somewhere (new) a little closer since it won't be a full week.Any suggestions? LOTW is interesting, but its a little intimidating as well. I have a Lund 1710 Predator so BIG water is less appealing. Also, we are more into pike than walleyes given a choice.Any thoughts are appreciated. I wouldn't mind Lac Seul again, just looking into my options.ThanksMatt"

1222988,floatplane,2010-07-27 21:37:00,2,hey there Matt.give us a call at nungesser lake lodge. also check out our websitewww.nungesserlake.com

Good population of pike, as well as great walleye and smallmouth. If you are considering a late September trip, the big crappies show up. Lot's of sheltered bays and islands to get behind. Your boat will do great there The two times I've been there say between the 12th and 21st, there's been a group of guys that do nothing but fish for pike. Have fun no matter where you go.Nimstug38 days and counting."
1224451,Guest,2010-08-02 12:01:00,0,You shouldn't be afraid of LOTW. I just came back from a 5-day trip. Caught all the Northern Pike you would want to catch in Knickabocker Bay just west of Whitefish Bay off of the Big Water on LOTW. I had a 25 ' Trophy but rented a 17 foot Lund for some special fishing and it did the BIG WATER just fine. I would highly recommend Tomahawk Resort for your stay...

If the lake has turned over and the water temp. 45-55 degrees the big Walleye's are smacken the minnows. You will always get out and the northern fishing by the feeder river mouths can be great. The weather that time of the year is very unpredictable.Don"
1224580,flntknp17,2010-08-02 19:52:00,151,Thanks for the thoughts everyone. I have decided to go back to my normal old stomping grounds on Lac Seul instead of looking for new water this fall. Maybe next year I will try something new!Matt
