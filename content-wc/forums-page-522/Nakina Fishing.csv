Flying into Brace Lake at the end of August with 8-guys, anyone have a report? We have 2-bear hunters and 6-fisherman. Have been going there for a few years and know the water level will be down this year, but hope that someone will shed some light on the fishing this year. We have 4-new to the group this year.Thanks in advance,Rob"

Good pike were scarce. Lost a good one and saw several others cruising. Is this your first trip to Melchett? I have marked maps if you need them, just advise."

Haven't been there since 2007. Anything new in the camp? I think they had just added the second fridge on our last trip. Kip"

Would be interested to see/hear about your new spots to see if it's something we haven't tried before. My e-mail is [email protected] if you are interested in sharing."
