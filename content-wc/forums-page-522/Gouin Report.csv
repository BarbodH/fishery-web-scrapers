The dirt road to Clova was OK and it took us a little over 3.5 hours. Weather for the week ranged from low of 47 to a high of 90. It rained for about 5 minutes 1 day and that was it. It has been real dry and the lake is down 6-8 feet. We did not see 1 back fly and maybe a total of 5 mosquitos. The deer/horse flies were active at the end of the week with the hot weather. Accomodations were nice and clean and met expectations. We would get up at 5 and fish to about 9 and then come back for breakfast. After breakfast we would go out for a couple of more hours and head in for a 2-3 hour nap and dinner. We headed back out from about 5 till dusk. We caught walleye and pike in 4-25 feet mostly over rocky bottoms. This was the first time we were in this bay. We would troll rapalas and crankbaits using bottom bouncers to locate the fish. Bottom bouncers worked great and we did not loose too many lures on snags. Once located, we would jig away with a twister tail/gulp tipped with 1/2 a crawler. Best bite was in the morning and evening. Midday the fishing tailed off. Most fish were caught in 8-15 feet of water. We did cast for some pike and they were holding tight to rocks. We totaled 244 walleye and 74 pike for the week. I caught my largest walleye(25"") and pike (38"") ever in a matter of 4 hours. Dad had the high hook with 20 walleye one morning. Kept 6 fish for dinner and 5 of them had leaches in their belly. Next time I will take less crawler and pack in some leaches. Very enjoyable trip and got a lot of time to spend time with my dad!"
1211967,Freytown,2010-06-21 07:23:00,770,"Thxs for the report.I just returned from the Gouin, fished Baie du Sud and had similiar results 6/12 - 6/19). I jigged about 80% of the time with plastic's tipped with night walkers.Caught lots of walleye in the 14 inch range and only a few in the 20"" range. Didn't catch any larger but one group that fished this baie many times had some very impressive ""eyes"" and pike. They had lot's of 4-5 lb eyes and one pike about 12 lbs. They were trolling with ThinFins in 6-10 feet of water and were very successful. This was my first time at Baie du Sud and it took a few days to get on fish. Another party took a 25lb pike trolling also.Black flies were few but the deer flies were bad. The outfitter said the water was down about 6 feet from normal.Fires east of Parent were still burning but we had no problem West of Parent."
1212485,Freytown,2010-06-22 09:09:00,770,Just an update to yesterday's post. The lower entrance to East Bay is closed-off due to the low water levels. You must go to the top (North end) of South Bay to get into East Bay.
1223226,NNYorker,2010-07-28 18:21:00,11,Anyone one have any information on water level and how the walleye fishing has been? Heading up to Gouin in 10 days. Have fished it several times before but always late June-early July and fishing has always been awesome. Not sure about early-mid August. We will be staying on Mattawa Bay with Tamarac outfitters.
1224463,Freytown,2010-08-02 12:57:00,770,"The water was down 5-6 ft in June and don't think they got too much rain since I was there. Lower water will be better than when it's too high, imo. I have fished Aug & Sept many times and the eyes are usually in deeper water. Mattawa is a good Baie but I would fish Sarrana if I had a choice in Aug or Sept. Air Tamarac has cabins in Sarrana also.Good luck."
1224562,NNYorker,2010-08-02 18:47:00,11,"Freytown,Thanks for the input. We have fished both Mattawa bay and Sarana Bay with Tamarac and found that we like the more secluded feel of Mattawa and it is a bit easier to fish since Sarana is a much larger bay and can be difficult to fish when it is windy. I guess we'll find out in a week or so how the fishing on Mattawa is in August."
