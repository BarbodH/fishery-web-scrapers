1223124,Smeds,2010-07-28 12:32:00,103,"Is there a general consensus regarding how one is treated related to the package you purchase? Just returned from a resort in Canada, and it sure seemed like we were on the back burner as far as how ""important"" we were to the owner of the camp in relation to the American Plan guests. After the explanation (i.e.: begging) with the wife, the burning of a week of vacation time as well as the outlay of well over $1500.00 for the trip ... I was left feeling extremely disappointed. Not with the fishing, but with how we ended up feeling like we were not important because we had brought our own boat, and didn't have an open-ended budget to include American Plan and other ""amenities"". Even a member of the housekeeping staff mentioned on our departure, ""I didn't even know there were people staying in that cabin."" Granted, we were out fishing for most of the day ... but one would think there would be a list of cabin's occupied! Also, it is normal procedure for a camp operator to include a set amount of gas with your ""package"", advertise a set price that includes guides, and then use your allottment of gas towards the guide boats, and charge you for the extra gas used by the guides over your allotted amount? BTW, no mention of that anywhere on website or via a few back and forth e-mails. On a tight budget for a trip of a lifetime, it would've certainly helped knowing that in advance ... although the owner took care of us on that issue (although very grumpy), it could have really hurt us in the end having only brought cash. I won't name the resort or the location ... just venting and wondering what your opinions are. As an ""average joe"" on what should have been a trip of a lifetime ..."
1223134,Old Timer,2010-07-28 13:17:00,255,"Smeds: I have fished Ontario for fifty years and have stayed at many camps, some American Plan, some housekeeping and some that offer both. Many American Plan camps may have a cabin or two for folks who want to do the trip on their own. But those camps primarily cater to their American plan guests and those folks get most of the attention. It may not be intentional, but that's the way it almost always works. And the billing is often a package deal that has to be broken apart for a housekeeping guest. My advise is that if you want to bring your own boat, cook your own meals and guide yourself, you should shop for camps that are solely housekeeping operations, and there are many of those on good water. If you want full service, go to a camp that specializes with American Plan. I have a regular stable of AP camps and housekeeping camps. Depending on my demeanor and then-existing bank account I'll go one way or the other. I assure you your trip will be more enjoyable if you make your plans accordingly. For what it's worth, I never go on a ""special"" or ask for any kind of discount on the trip. I always pay the listed price to be assured I'm not going to be short-changed on the cabin, boat, fishing assistance or whatever. The few bucks you might save are simply not worth the risk. Just my thoughts."
1223137,wallydave,2010-07-28 13:44:00,2151,"Most of my trips have been to a housekeeping camp. The group I go with , we like to cook, and we like to have the flexibility of the housekeeping plan. One year we tried a fly-in, no I will not reveal the name, we went with the outpost housekeeping option. We felt the whole trip, we were imposing on the staff and camp owners by taking this option. Nearly all of the contact from the staff was trying to sell us on hiring a guide. No suggestions on what or where they were biting. The only time we saw the owner, was waiting for the plane the day we left. He hoped in his boat to make sure we cleaned up the cabins, which we had. (cleaner than when we arrived) We had a group of mostly younger men and thier sons. The folks at the main camp were all pretty old, from a marketing outlook, I would want to make sure a younger group, had a great trip, give them a few pointers, so they will be back. One of the guides mentioned that they did not like to see a group come up and have a hard time finding fish, but he sure did not offer any advise?! Stick with a house keeping plan!"
1223141,Larry Mac,2010-07-28 13:56:00,530,"Hi walleyedave, I agree 100% with oldtimer. We prefer housekeeping PKGs exclusively. I realize how much planning and saving it takes us to make this trip of a lifetime come true. We have also been going to Canada for many years and have a list of preferred camps that I would recommend to anyone wanting a good experience. We are not expecting to be treated like kings but are always treated well and made to feel at home. Keep the faith; there are many, many great camps and fishing opportunities in our good neighbors to the north's wonderful country. As for your other question we do not like hidden or mysterious charges. We know up front what the estimated cost of the trip will be, like you stated we are required to pay cash also. Thank you,Larry Mac"
1223150,tv4fish,2010-07-28 14:26:00,2694,"Smeds: Sorry to hear you didn't have a good experience. I think it IS pretty common knowledge that the American Plan guests will be treated better than the Housekeeping guests at most camps - facts are facts - there's more money involved. However, you still are/were a paying guest and should have been treated better. Regarding the gas bit --- ask detailed questions about items like that before you reserve a time spot - it is assumed you won't be going back to the same place.We do the housekeeping plan every year at Red Pine Resort at Sioux Lookout with no problems --- they treat us well and know what we want and don't want."
1223160,cast_and_blast,2010-07-28 15:04:00,1098,"My experrience has been the same when going to a camp that offers both American plan and housekeeping plan and you have a mix in the camp at the same time.Quote: Originally Posted by SmedsAlso, it is normal procedure for a camp operator to include a set amount of gas with your ""package"", advertise a set price that includes guides, and then use your allottment of gas towards the guide boats, and charge you for the extra gas used by the guides over your allotted amount?Yep, I've run into the same on the 1 trip that I took that was American plan. Gas allottment and bait allottment was consumed by the guide boat the same as it would be by your own personal boat. The main thing I didn't like was the fact that we were put on someone else's schedule. Be here at such-and-such time for breakfast and such-and-such time for dinner. Nah. If I feel like eating at 5am and going out fishing - that is what I want to do! If the fish are biting I may not want to head back for a 6pm dinner. For me, my family and my buddies we've found that it works much, much better to go housekeeping at a housekeeping only resort. Good luck! Scott"
1223188,Steve of Madison,2010-07-28 16:22:00,230,"I'm exactly the same way. If I feel like staying out until 7 or 8 pm because the fish are biting I'm sure NOT going to go in just to make sure I hit the table on time.In now 13 trips to canada my group has always done the housekeeping plan, for that exact reason. We fish when we want too, eat what we cook (we gain weight for the week), and live on our timetable. For some guys AP is the way to go, but I can find my own fish, bait my own hook, cook my own food, clean up after myself, and I've learned to tie my own shoes a long time ago. And I certainly don't need to pay extra for those services.If you need some advice on some very good Housekeeping camps that will cost you WAY less than $1500 round trip and on some really great water, all you have to do is ask."
1224373,Bill Krejca,2010-08-02 07:32:00,6107,"As has been stated, the guest on the AP just has the opportunity to interface more with the camp owner. It is natural to probably develop a closer relationship with those whose path's cross. Housekeeping guests, if they have been at it a while, get pretty good at self-sufficiency, knowing what items, i.,e., cooking pans, etc, they will need/like, and have little occasion to seek out the camp folks, unless some cabin facility breaks, etc. With that in mind, I believe this does not absolve the owner from, at some time during the stay, stopping by and saying ""Hi, glad to have you with us."" Bill Krejca"
1224443,leogunner,2010-08-02 11:30:00,18,I couldn't agree more with your last statement
1224513,nlar,2010-08-02 15:28:00,3,"We stayed at Sturgeon River Lodge (Part of Ghost River) and will be back again next year. We did the house keeping and it works well for us, we like to cook, fish on our time and not have any kind of schedule. We also can give Ghost River a days notice and you can join them for the evening meal, we didn't but we may next year. Don is a really nice guy, in the morning the boat would be mopped out, gas tank filled, minnow bucket on the boat and he would stop at the cabin and mark our map on where the good bite was happening. After 30 trips to Canada we were catered to on the house keeping plan at Sturgeon River like I haven't been before."
1223865,Mark R,2010-07-30 16:57:00,1538,There is a reply to the original post from the camp owner on Muskie First web site. It may be pulled as the original thread was. Intresting response from the owner. I guess there is two sides to every story
1224130,wallydave,2010-07-31 22:40:00,2151,"The fly-in we tried was Nielsens, thier attidude towards our group was most unfriendly! As I mentioned before, thier guests were all older, I stopped to help one gentle man who was older, to help him get out of his boat, he looked at me like I had tried to take advantage of one of his grandchildren. We had a large group, and we were made to feel like second class citizens. The AP is a higher profit option I'm sure, but we had a group of 12 people on the HP plan! Our group will stick with the HP plan, where we feel welcomed!"
1224135,Stu,2010-07-31 23:24:00,472,Thanks Dave. We used the Am. plan at Nielsen's. I didn't even know they had a house keeping plan. We were there several years ago. Sorry you had problems. Maybe they will read this and take your comments to heart.
1224144,Obabikon,2010-08-01 05:06:00,2370,"Seems like some American Plan bashing. Not every option is for everyone. However, the American Plan definately has its place. I have done both on my own trips, but offer mostly American Plan at our resort. Between cleaning, cooking, washing dishes... you probably get close to a couple hours or more extra fishing when on the AP. Assuming you take advantage of it. Now, on the point of being treated as ""lesser"" class citizens when you come HK vs. AP... that's an issue of a resort by resort basis. However, it is difficult as an owner to connect with HK guests. Many of them don't come in until late in the evening. They are on a different scheduel... which is kind of the point of the package. Luckily most of our HK guests started as AP... so the relationship is already there. Then there's always the reasoning... AP guests are that way for a reason. They want the extra service, and the extra attention. HK guests are that way for a reason. They don't need the extra service, or the extra attention. As far as AP's being more profitable... when you talk about the costs of purchasing, transporting, and cooking the food... then add the costs of all the extra employees. It's not as much ""profit"" as you would think. And, everything costs money... there has to be profit built in if you want more services. That's the way resort owners and resort employees make a living. Anyhow... to wrap it up. Everyone wants something different. If the resort isn't offering or providing the service you want/need, switch. But, don't group all resorts into a general profile. Many places do an excellent job and provide excellent service to both American Plan and Housekeeping customers."
1224146,bob888,2010-08-01 05:19:00,244,"Half a dozen years ago my wife and I stayed a week at Grassy Narrows on Miles Bay, LOW. We were the only guests of a full resort that was on the housekeeping plan.The resort owners treated us excellently and although not a part of the package provided us free dinners on our first and last day."
1224164,nitrodude,2010-08-01 07:32:00,60,"We've stayed in the same camp on Lac Seul the last 15yrs. with an HK plan and I wouldn't want it any different. Cabins are clean and well kept. Beds are comfy and screens actually keep the bugs out for a comfortable night's rest after fishing all day. Boats are clean, fully outfitted and gassed up with an additional spare tank in case it's needed. We get up when we want and eat breakfast, pack a sack lunch or grab the shore lunch box (no additional charge) and go. We come back at will to make dinner and relive the day's events. Our meals consist of the groceries we choose to buy with everyone adding a few pounds by week's end. For us, it has been the best and the camp staff treat everyone like family. I tried an AP camp several years ago when a friend's group had a dropout. (Got to go for two weeks that year!! ) The camp was nice and staff was great. The food was good, but limited to their menu. Fishing was also limited to their schedule, if you wanted to eat. Boats were good, but bait was limited. (We paid additionally in town for our own. ) It was a great trip, all things considered, until the bill arrived. I was shocked, to say the least, when my share equaled to three times what I paid a month before and usually pay each year on an HK plan! Since then, I always recommend the HK for folks that don't mind caring for their own meals. Doing that and paying for boat rental, gas and bait is well worth 1/3 of the price charged on the AP to me."
1224213,wallydave,2010-08-01 12:41:00,2151,"Obi, I was not bashing the AP! Our group simply felt that we did not recieve the kind of treatment, warm and friendly help, when we were at the ""other"" camp. We simply prefer the flexibility of the HP! Our group likes to cook, we all take turns with the chores, we seem to have a ""bonding experiance"" that makes for an added richness to the fishing and the scenery! I'm glad that there are options available so more people can enjoy the Canadian experience. Every resort, lodge,camp has thier strengths and weaknesses. Good customer experience will nearly always make for return visits!"
1224226,Obabikon,2010-08-01 14:06:00,2370,"Dave, Your posts were fine. However, some were negative... and grouped AP resorts together as if we all treat our guests that way... or charge that much. Anyhow, much like the poster who has been to Grassy Narrows stated... a good owner treats the high end guests as well as the lower end guests. If you're not getting that service, don't blame American Plan resorts... blame the single resort. Even if it's a trend... that doesn't mean it's the only case. Also, I know a lot of places that you can do the American Plan relatively cheaply. (in the range of $700 per person per week). I also know a lot of places that you can do the American Plan at an incredibly high rate. ($500+ per person per day). Same is true for House Keeping places... and for the most part I've found that you get what you pay for. There's a few diamonds in the rough (and a few lemons) out there, but all in all... charges are more based on what you're getting. If you're looking for bang for your buck... it costs $10 for a camping permit... tough to beat that price."
1224232,teddi,2010-08-01 15:03:00,349,"i think you will see a lot of camps drop ap in the future. there are a lot of regs regarding meal preperation coming into play soon and not everyone can afford to upgrade their kitchens. it,s cheaper to go back to housekeeping."
1224305,Obabikon,2010-08-01 20:33:00,2370,"You're right about that Teddi. It's getting tougher and tougher to own any type of restraunt. It's too bad, because there's a lot of great cooks out there."
1223670,octanehi5,2010-07-30 06:54:00,1104,"I am talking about Quebec, I have found that you are over paying when you go north on the american plan,and a few guys mentioned your on there sch of time eat dinner at 6pm best time to be fishing not eating. we have honed our cooking and menu skills over the yrs. we know what to bring or not. we like to stay in the most remote camps ,do not want to hear anyone else.If you want american plan go to an outfitter that only does that type of fishing,then everyone is treated the same. also the outfitter we go with includes the boats all the gas,propane etc. no bills when you leave. If you would like some info on some very good outfitters you can e-mail me at [email protected]"
1223697,Kruger,2010-07-30 08:05:00,259,"Our group is different, I guess. We go to fish and relax. Every morning I get out of bed and when I come back in the afternoon it is made with a fresh towel sitting on the foot. I have a choice of about anything I could want for breakfast. I walk down the dock to a gassed up clean boat every morning. The boat has everything you could possibly need for shore lunch except the fish. At the lake we go to I haven't found a time the fish weren't biting. So heading in at 6 isn't a problem. When you come in a dock kid ties up the boat, asks if you need a hand carrying anything and then starts cleaning the boat for tomorrow. At dinner there is a loaded salad bar, all kind of appetizers (smoked salmon, oysters, cheeses, meats etc). Then the main course (ribs, steak, prime rib, turkey etc). Then home made pies/cakes for dessert. For all this we pay $450 more for the week than the housekeeping plan."
1223730,Mark R,2010-07-30 09:15:00,1538,"Kruger, where is this paradise you describe? What is the name of the camp?"
1223745,Kruger,2010-07-30 09:59:00,259,http://www.pineportage.com/I just got back on Tuesday. My only complaint was the lake was down a few feet so they had to make the dock longer than usual.
1223747,Kruger,2010-07-30 10:01:00,259,"I almost forgot. They sell beer there, so you don't have to fly it in."
1223778,cast_and_blast,2010-07-30 11:19:00,1098,"Looks nice, but almost triple what we last paid per person for a week long fly-in about 3 years ago (considering that CA and US funds are essentially at par). I'd rather take my whole family up to northern MN for a week for that amount - but it looks like a great place that really caters to their customers. To each their own - just get out and fish! Scott"
1223803,Steve of Madison,2010-07-30 12:57:00,230,"That does sound really nice....BUT HOLY &*^%.......it's also double what i pay for a housekeeping and 3 times if i choose the AP. At those rates i can't justify the cost anymore. And I am on a camp on Lac Seul, better boats and motors than what is descibed there, and I can park my truck right next to my cabin.Like I said before, AP is great for some guys, and if you can afford it and justify it, good for you. I can't!"
1223827,Crede,2010-07-30 14:47:00,134,"We generally alternate AP at a flyin lodge and housekeeping at a flyin outpost cabin. Usually we get more fishing time in at the AP lodge, but I can see how that might not be true for everyone. After 10 of the housekeeping outposts trips I think we have things down pretty efficiently but the ""housekeeping"" aspect still seems to occupy a fair amount of time. I generally find that we pay approx. $400-500 more per person for a week with the AP. Regarding differences in treatment between housekeeping and American Plan, we have only been to one place where we had a choice - and have been there twice. Kagianagami Lodge with Leuenbergers out of Nakina. Once housekeeping and once AP. We were treated equally well from beginning to end each time. Staff were equally helpful each time from beginning to end. Early in each week they have an outdoor ""shore lunch"" for dinner. Everyone in camp, both AP and housekeeping, are invited at no extra cost. I thought this was a very nice touch and let various groups kind of break the ice, share stories and information, etc."
1223852,Stu,2010-07-30 15:59:00,472,"I have tried the American plan twice and have been very pleased. Both times were at Nielsen's and the food was fantastic. We only do housekeeping now because we all have families and it keeps the cost down. I saw some negative posts and neither of you mentioned the lodge by name. Personally, I wish you would. I have always been proud of the ethical way that most people carry themselves here. There is very little bashing, but if you have a bad experience, please let us know so we don't waste our money. The information shared here is a very powerful tool and I, for one, appreciate it."
1223862,lcwhit,2010-07-30 16:40:00,104,"i also have seen preferential treatment of american plan folks. it doesn't fit my fishing style. i come and go as i please and do not require a guide. you can understand how it happens. these folks are in business for a profit and from the prices, it looks like the meals are very profitable. they probably get to know them pretty well since they dine together every evening and some breakfasts."
1223212,Skyraptor,2010-07-28 17:35:00,291,"Everything everyone has said is true. For most the HK plan is the way to go. I usually go with my brothers and dad and a few friends and it is great to share the camp duties of an HK plan. Each day a person is responsible for the cooking so no one gets stuck with it each day. But there is a time and place for the AP as well. I'm headed to Manotak Lodge in late August and I'm taking my girlfriend who has never been to Canada or fishing in Canada and I'm going with the AP plan so she has some time to be with others around the table, she will not have to worry about cooking or what to cook and she can just relax and know that someone else is cleaning the cabin each day and preparing the meals for us to each. It will leave a good taste in her mouth and will get her to enjoy the trip and future trips as well."
1223213,SinOrSwim,2010-07-28 17:40:00,1528,"We do a fly in each year for the past 14 years and have tried the American/meal plan once. Will never do it again. Granted, our experience was a little different as the owner was selling the cabins and I think we were the last ones there. We paid a lot of extra money for the ""food"" plan and found pancake mix, carrots, celery, some potatos and peanut butter. Stuff that was blah and bland and the food stunk. We have honed our menu over the years and our meals along with shore lunch are 10x more gourmet than what we would get on a plan. I also agree with the time issue. Sometimes we come in from fishing at 5 and sometimes 7 or 8. I do wish we had someone available to clean the camp though. LOL"
