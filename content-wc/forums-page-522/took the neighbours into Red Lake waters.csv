We were at South Bay for 7 weeks and really wanted to say ""hi"" So what is the bite on Gull Rock these days??? With early ice out, we had terrific fishing, scary weather and great fishing but you had to spend some time thinking about where they were. Water temps? Wish we were there. Now home at Labor Camp."
1222097,tackleman,2010-07-24 17:23:00,444,"the fishing has slowed somewhat but you still can get them almost everywhere. found that they were deeper, 28 to 35 feet but I think they went that deep with all the crappy weather we had and they should come back to the 20 foot range with the warmer sunny weather we are expecting.Water temp yesterday ranged from 74 to 70 degrees depending on where you were and how much current was in that area."

The weather looks pretty nasty this week then maybe getting hot early part of next week. Any thoughts on what this will do to our fishing? It will be our first time to the lake, so nothing like adding a bunch of weather changes to make finding those fish even harder!! Tackleman, I've appreciated all of your posts in the past...keeps me going when I'm still 20 hours away!"
1224714,Moondog,2010-08-03 09:26:00,362,"We left Gull Rock on July 7th and had been fishing summer patterns for several weeks. The water is warm so the fish will be deep, off humps etc. You shouldn't have any trouble finding them!!!! Just pray for wind."

I hope to get out tomorrow if the meds work tonight and may be able to give you a better update."
