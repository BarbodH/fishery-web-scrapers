1224297,jaggersr,2010-08-01 20:05:00,44,"There is a Trading Post at Tunnel Lake called Tunnel Lake Trading post, go figure. They sell minnows, crawlers and leaches. They also have groceries tackle and any odd and end you may forget plus gas."

1224311,Rich B,2010-08-01 20:54:00,1081,"Thanks......I've bought bait at the Tunnel Lake trading post, though rather pricey for leaches, etc.....was thinking there may be a bait store in the Soo where I could get better pricing ? Appreciate the info.......thanks again....."
1224314,jaggersr,2010-08-01 21:07:00,44,The Trading post in the Soo is a little cheaper on bait. I called there this week for the price of a flat of crawlers and price of minnows (4.00 per doz) . I will be going through there Saturday heading to Chapleau. They are .65 more per dozen at Tunnel Lake. I bought crawlers at the Trading post in early June (11 dozen for $30.00). Have never fished Tunnel lake but have always wondered how the fishing was there.
