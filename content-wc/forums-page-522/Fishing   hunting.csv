1223799,lenray,2010-07-30 12:37:00,467,Heading up to north of the village of Pickle Lake this fall or late summer. Don't want to be there bothering the moose hunters. Question--what are the hunting dates for that area???? Thanks

I know because I shot a great bull around 10:30 that morning. We weren't in the gmu that Pickle Lake would be in. We flew about 75 miles north of Cochrane in Central Ontario.I believe it's usually around the middle of September."
