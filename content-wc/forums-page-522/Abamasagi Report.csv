The cabin and facilities were the nicest we've ever had in this price range (under $700.00) for the week. We had a nice, big cabin, generator, hand water pump at the kitchen sink (huge hit for our whole gang), fish cleaning station, freezer, and separate fridge. The beds weren't very good but with how nice the rest of the cabin was we didn't care. The boats were really nice 16' Nadens that had the paint worn off them but they didn't leak and had great swivel seats. The motors left a little to be desired but they started every day and got us where we needed to be. Fishing- The fishing started out a little slow, we target walleye almost exclusively and bring no live bait at all. Day one two of us caught about 34 witha few in the plus 20"" range. Day two we had 45 with 3 or 4 in the 20"" plus range including a 25"", the other boat caught a 25 1/2"" dandy. Day three we were starting to figure things out and we boated 58, fish 95% walleye, more big ones thrown in there. Day 4 we caught 68 but as our numbers kept increasing we were fishing shallower and the fish were averaging a much smaller size. For those of you wondering, the first few days we almost exclusively vertical jigged in 20-21 feet of water and the bite was really light. On day 5 we figured out that the numbers of fish had moved shallower, they weren't there the first few days of the trip, or they weren't biting. We started trolling Rat-L-Traps in 10-13 feet of water and started spanking the walleye, neither of us can stand trolling so we didn't troll a lot but we jigged in the same depth water and had started catching fish here and there. We caught a total of 74 on day five. Day 6 we did more of the same thing, some of our earlier spots had slowed and it was raining miserably so we didn't get out until pretty late and we still managed 75. Day 7 started great in the morning, we had 62 to our boat by 1:00 P.M. and we were all set to hit the 100 mark but a very nasty wind and rain storm came in so the the fishing day got cut very short. We ended up with 79 and my buddy got big fish of the trip on that last day with a 26 1/2"" walleye. Big pike of the trip went to one of the guys in the other boat with a 37 incher that he said was huge. I happen to believe him because all of the pike we caught were bigger around then anywhere I've ever fished in my life. This lake has some huge fish potential both for walleye and pike and there are also some lake trout in it (we fished for them for about one hour, one day) I've never seen as many large baitfish plumes as I saw on my fishfinder on this lake so I think the fish have more than enough to keep them big and healthy. Had a great time"

It's not always about the numbers as much as it is the experience of being with good friends for a week in a beautiful setting like the lakes we fish in Ontario. My group all fish with 1/4 oz. jigs and gulp tipped with a piece of crawler and we do fine. We also fish the pike in afternoon casting and some trolling with good success. Our largest pike has been 43"" and biggest walleye 27"" at Brace Lake. Our group of 8 will be leaving in 22 days. We also have 2 in our group that will be bear hunting this year. Thanks again for the report."
