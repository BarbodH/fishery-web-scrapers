1224990,Hump,2010-08-04 07:39:00,578,"For those that are upset about the included price of gas and minnows, I would like to ask what your expectations are? I personally feel that it helps bring the cost of the trip down. Even something as simple as "" free ice"" helps. At another camp, i spent $20+ a week on ice. this is included."
1225002,Mark R,2010-08-04 08:18:00,1538,"Joker, you are right 15 liters would last all day but it's included you don't pay any extra for it. The price for the fishermans package is $119.00 per night plus taxes. I'm not sure what other camps charge but I looked at booking a room at the Super 8 in FF and they wanted just over $100.00 for one room with 2 beds per night. NO gas, no minnows , no boat with a 60HP motor, no kitchen, no fish cleaning house just the room. So for $19.00 a night more you get thes extra perks included."
1222914,Juls,2010-07-27 17:47:00,13414,"Simple....before you get in the boat in the morning, tell them you want the gas tank topped off."
1222950,Mark R,2010-07-27 19:00:00,1538,"I don't know Juls that sounds like your saying take responsiblity for your fishing experience. You must be ""old school"" LOL one other thing about minnows if you are paying for a dozen minnows how many do you expect to get?"
1222959,teddi,2010-07-27 19:48:00,349,"i have been reading this thread with interest. underthewire, your party didn,t catch any fish on lac seul as well as not catching any on eagle. i am the guy that talked to you on the dock about your problems at eagle. camp guest should find another camp if he is not happy with evergreen but i have to agree with him to a point. this running out of gas in camp boats is a commen problem there. pat should have adressed last year and it would not be a problem this year. i have always found the minnow count to be better than any other camp ln the area. evergreen is a good camp to go to. better than most. just my take on this thread"
1223971,Hump,2010-07-31 06:42:00,578,"This is my 6th year at Evergreen. I doubt you will find better boats in NW Ontario. The ""dock guys"" name is Moose. When he gave us instructions for boat use, he specifically told us that if we consistently go to McKensize or Steamboat, let him know. I asked him to top off my boat and he did. I do believe his favorite saying is "" No Problem."" As far as cost...do realize the bait and ice is included in the price. With the prices of minnows, that is huge. We got more than the dozen, but hey, a dozen is a dozen. i do know that at the beginning of the year there was a shortage. go to four Seasons and pay $5.29 for large minnows. My cabins have always been very clean and insect free. We never go further than Lunker Island and always catch fish, as many as those that go to Steamboat. This isn't an advertisement, just the plain truth."

1224072,lcwhit,2010-07-31 16:33:00,104,we had the same gas problem 5 years ago. we told the dock person that we were running to mckenzie daily and did a lot of back trolling and she filled it daily. don't remember any problems with minnows. i thought gary trapped them in the bush back then. maybe not.
1224107,Hump,2010-07-31 19:55:00,578,Gary does trap them and they are good minnows.
1224884,MisterD,2010-08-03 19:58:00,6,Gary still traps his own minnows. Fished there in June for the 1st time. Will be back. Never ran out of gas. Patty topped the boats up either that night or the next morning. I believe you get 30 gallons of gas per boet per day plus 2 dozen minnows per fisherman each day included in the price. Will be booking for next year soon... Joel
1224959,Mark R,2010-08-04 06:09:00,1538,15 liters per boat per day included in the deluxe fisherman package plus the 2 dozen minnows per day as already mentioned.
1224979,jokerjim,2010-08-04 07:07:00,473,15 liters of gas will not get you very far !!!!!!
1222341,Guest,2010-07-26 05:11:00,0,"the gas guage on the boat didn,t work. i am checking out timberlane lodge or gold eagle resort for our fall trip. am going to have to book soon or maybe not get the time we want."
1222358,leogunner,2010-07-26 06:22:00,18,"Camp, you must have went on an off week. I didn't have any of the problems you described."
1222362,davenathe,2010-07-26 06:39:00,113,"How about ""underwire"" user providing more information. Post appears odd for a 1st post, looks like an advertisement."
1222382,Mark R,2010-07-26 07:18:00,1538,"That's too bad Camp Guest ran out of gas twice on the same trip. He must have gone a long way away from camp. We go along ways way to fish and have never run out of gas. When we do make long runs we mention it to Pat and if we need gas we get it, otherwise I think you start with a full tank on Saturday and it get refilled on Tuesday or Wednesday. You can always get more by saying you are makeing long trips on a daily basis. In the 12 years I have been going there this is the first tip I have heard of anyone running out of gas. Good Luck. I hope fishing is god when I get there in two weeks but if it isn't I won't blame the camp"
1222390,wallydave,2010-07-26 07:56:00,2151,"I have always fished out of Goose bay in the Ear Falls area. Cliff told our group that the gas guages are not very accurate, so we should let him know if we were going to mackenzie bay for a day of fishing, he would give an extra tank of gas. If you let the staff know your plans, they might be able work with you to prevent any trouble. Fishing the Ear Falls area has usually been good to great, but there are times we have had to work different areas to find the fish. The challenge to find the fish, is part of the adventure and mystery of fishing eh?"
1222408,leogunner,2010-07-26 08:36:00,18,Same thing with my group. We let Pat know we heading out and a long run and the boat was filled that night. Usually the boats were filled every other day
1222428,Steve of Madison,2010-07-26 09:50:00,230,"My question is, if you are using camp boats, particularly the ones you are describing, why don't they just fill the boats every morning or evening when you come back in, rather than run the risk of running out of gas. The camp I go to fills his camp boats every morning, that way when I take off I know I will not run out. Those boats have at least a 15 gal tank, with a new motor there is very little chance you are going to run out in a single day. Our camp uses 17' Lund Outfitters w/ 50hp Honda 4 strokes and I have yet to use any more than 5 gals all day. This is just like when you rent a car, it's full and it's kept full, you pay for the gas you use, simple. If I would run out of gas because they didn't fill me up and the guage didn't work, that would be the last time I visited that camp. We were a long way from camp last year when a group from a lodge just down the lake from us showed up, after fishing they try and take off and they are out of gas. I put them in my boat and went back to their camp, they told the owners were they could pick up the boat. That is just bad management in my opinion."
1222492,Mike Kansas,2010-07-26 13:45:00,1463,"I have spent time at Evergreen and all I can tell you is that the PLACE IS GREAT. Pat & Gary bend over backwards to make things right and their employees are totally dedicated to customer service. The last time there my wife caught a 31 1/2"" Walleye. They treat you right. Mike Kansas"
1222636,Underthewire,2010-07-26 20:13:00,2,To davenathe: Nope It's not an advertisement! My family and I spent our first day at a Lodge on Eagle Lake. After a day of no fish and no hits I asked the lodge owner a couple of questions. He ranted and raved and insulted me for about 15 minutes and rather then blowing up and making a scene we called around for a new lodge. Pat was very understanding and made room for us. Compared to where we were this was a palace. The staff even took us out for 1/2 a day to show us some of his fishing spots and try to give us some tips. Unfortununatly the fish just weren't hitting. Sorry if you think my original message was an advertisement but it was just my feelings. Maybe you should give them a try! You won't be disappointed.
1222841,Guest,2010-07-27 14:12:00,0,"I have stayed at Evergreen lodge and really like the place. Clean, nice boats, etc. We did run into a problem last year with almost running out of gas. We came in on fumes and another person in our party did run out of gas. We cut our day short since it looked like we were going to run out of gas. I do not understand the reason for not filling up the boats each night / day. We did not leave the dock until 8:00 AM each day. We would make a run down to Steamboat and backtroll all day. I think with the newer motors - 60hp vs 50hp maybe they burn a little more gas. I would also agree that at times they are stingy with the minnows - I would ask for more and say they could add it to my cabin. We ran out of minnows a few years back - I won't let that happen again. I figure that I drive up almost 10 hours for the 3 day fishing trip - the least thing I want to happen is either run out of gas or bait. *** Please do not get me wrong - I enjoy staying at Evergreen and I will be returning this Fall. However if they could correct these minor problems, it would be great."
1221976,Underthewire,2010-07-24 06:30:00,2,"My family and myself, total of 10, just got back from Lac Seul. We stayed at Evergreen Lodge near Ear Falls. This has to be one of the premier lodges for fisherman! The cabins are beutiful and the boats are new 19 foot Starcraft with 60 HP motors. The owners and staff are the best. They will help you in any way possible to assure a memorable stay for you and your families!! If your plans are for Lac Seul fishing give them a call, you won't be disappointed!!"
1221979,Mark R,2010-07-24 06:43:00,1538,After having gone there for the last 12 years we haven't been disapponted yet.
1222214,leogunner,2010-07-25 13:04:00,18,First time for me in June and can't wait for next year. I have no doubts why people come back to Evergreen Lodge again and again
1222238,MikeMcC,2010-07-25 16:23:00,72,"Evergreen is a quality place to stay. I particularly like their sheltered harbor. However it is a long boat ride to where I like to fish, also they were not very generous with the minnow count. Other than that all is good."
1222245,rather-be-fishin,2010-07-25 17:03:00,429,"Nice to hear, BUT how was the FISHING?????? We leave in 6 days for Lac Seul....& I can't wait!!!"
1222254,Guest,2010-07-25 17:45:00,0,fishing has been poor and the camp is not that great for what you are paying

1222295,Guest,2010-07-25 19:20:00,0,"have been there twice. last year fishing was so so. camp guide could not put us on fish and the boat ran out of gas. this year fishing was worse and the boat ran out of gas twice[had to get towed back once]. it seems the dock guy can,t fill up the boats every nite. the cabins although nice could be a little bit cleaner[bathrooms and kitchens]. just my take on the camp maybe i just hit a bad week."
