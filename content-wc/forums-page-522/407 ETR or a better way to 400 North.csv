1224481,Seanik,2010-08-02 13:41:00,218,"We are doing a 2nd fishing trip late Aug. to Shenango Lodge out of Foleyet, Ontario. This is a train in lodge and we will get on the train at Capreol (6:08 AM departure). The problem is we have not been in the Toronto area for about 5 years and need some current information on the best way to 400 North from the QEW. We will be going through Toronto about 11:00 AM on a Saturday. In the past Pennsylvania did not give the 407 ETR people it's license plate data base information, therefore no bill for the toll road use to PA residents. Now I'm told they stop vehicles from states without reciprocal arrangements, can't get much info off their website. I would rather pay the toll, then get stopped and delayed. Any info would be helpful especially someone from Pa who has recently used the 407 ETR or a GTA Resident. Thanks, Seanik"
1224558,Mondo_)H,2010-08-02 18:25:00,91,"Prepare to pay about a $1 a mile!!! To me thats a rip off, to some its a convenience of by-passing GTA. We used to use the QEW to 400 until the 407 became available and they didnt bill out of country vehicles. It was pretty reasonable at 1st when they did send you a bill but the last couple of years, it has gotten more expensive. I think my bill was like $48 for about 38 miles. And they charge you more during daylight (rush) hours I believe. And dont forget about the Taxes they apply to that as well!"
1224561,polaris-pete,2010-08-02 18:43:00,343,"Seanik- I am up that way alot during the year, fishing and snowmobilling. Just pback a few weeks ago and just got our 407 bill. It was $38.75 from where we got on in Hamilton to where we exited onto the 400 North. It saves about 25 minutes not going thru Toronto but if youre coming thru on a Sat. you should be good to go. I used to go the other ways, QEW, 403, 405, 401, 400 but many times we sat in heavy traffic waiting for accidents to be cleared and ambulances coming and going. We just figure in this cost as I am not one to sit and wait in a vehicle to save a few bucks. There are signs all along the 407 that states "" Out of Province drivers will be billed.At one time all out of province drivers did not get billed but that has changed. Some guys I know who go up snowmobilling in the winter spray the artifical spray snow on half their license plate so the cameras don't get their plate number but I am sure if they are caught, the fine and other related things that the OPP would get you for, would FAR EXCEED the toll rate. One thing I can tell you is that the cameras only take a shot of your REAR plate and NOT the front one.If you are hauling a large trailer that the cameras cannot see down at your rear plate, you will not get billed.Good luck on your trip."
1224673,ohiojmj,2010-08-03 07:10:00,1262,"I got billed for my trailer and van last year. Unless you're doing weekday rush hour, I'd skip the rip-off ETR/407. I refuse to accept the rip-off. I am not sure if EZpass works there either.On a wed. 8 a.m. rush hour a few weeks back, my delay was only 15 minutes taking the free route, which is no further. I take QEW to QEW/403E just past Hamilton bridge, 427N, 401E to 400N. Note: since going right past the toronto airport on this route, never ever take this route on a Canadian holiday weekend! We usually try to time our trip to avoid traffic in that huge metro area."
1224783,adempsey,2010-08-03 14:47:00,963,"I live in Toronto and not quite sure what direction you are coming from but you should just get on the 401 and take it to the 400. The 407 is best to take during rush hour. You should be OK on the 401 on a regular Saturday. Sure it's busy, but it's not rush hour.So, QEW to 427 North to 401 East to 400 North. The section of the 400 from the 401 to the 407 isn't the busy part anyway.If you're coming from further west, the 403 is also an option.Also, I am not sure what you mean about being stopped on the 407. There is nobody that ""mans the post"". It's totally automated and not patrolled by anyone but the provincial police. I rarely even see the police on it, but they are there and they don't enforce tolls just go after speeders."
1224844,polaris-pete,2010-08-03 17:48:00,343,The OPP enforce the speeding and vehicles which have plates either not in plain view of the cameras or under the trailer deck as most snowmobile manufacturers put them for many years. I know from my friends being stopped and fined! Also they have given tickets for trailer chain hooks that are not closed with a snap or spring to keep from coming off the tow vehicle accidentally. JUst another way to make a few bucks for the Ministry I guess.
1224936,adempsey,2010-08-04 00:12:00,963,"Yes, sorry. They will go after you for breaking any of the highway laws. I just meant they don't specifically care about the tolls. An obscured license plate is illegal on any highway. They can be particular about transporting snowmobiles/ATVs as well.Cheers!"
1224961,ohiojmj,2010-08-04 06:15:00,1262,"Ademsey, when taking the QEW from US toward Toronto and shortly past the Hamilton bridge at the 406, the signs confused me several times as I wanted to stay on the QEW toward Toronto (to get to 427), but the signs give me these three choices with little advance info about which lane to get into: 407/ETR, 403E, 403W. You must follow 403E which is actually combined with QEW for a while. Maybe I missed something, but I've been through a couple times each year."
1224965,fourize,2010-08-04 06:20:00,287,Taking this route for the first time in september. It was suggested by friends that live in Burlington.
