Although there wasn't a lot of color preference, it seemed that the brighter colors did a little better on overcast days, and the darker colors on sunny days. That's the opposite of what I've always been told, but I guess that the fish were proving me wrong. We found the best fishing in 10 to 15 feet of water, around and on rock piles."
1220472,Wall_Eye,2010-07-18 22:41:00,28,Thanks for the info...
1220521,Mike Borger,2010-07-19 06:49:00,1554,I'm headed into the game preserve on the 27th. Will report back when I return.
1220587,Wall_Eye,2010-07-19 09:42:00,28,That should be a great trip!!! Looking foward to the report
1223254,Wall_Eye,2010-07-28 19:46:00,28,22 days before set out to the Chapleau area Borden Lake is the spot.Not much info from this area must be a good sign that nobody wants to let the cat out of the bag on the great fishing there....
1224920,3M TA3,2010-08-03 22:35:00,2846,"10 more days for me. Yee haaa! Never fished Borden Lake although I've been told by several folks that the small mouth fishing can be exhausting at times. One after another all day long. Sure......should have been there yesterday...right? Anyway, I have experienced some days that were incredible on the Chapleau and those memories bring me back year after year. I used to think that it was an over fished, fished out body of water, but not true. Lots of fish although the Pike have taken a beating. Mostly hammer handles, but they are fun to catch too. Good Luck on Borden.RW"
1215652,Wall_Eye,2010-07-03 11:38:00,28,"Heading up there in August for my first Canada trip,any reports from this area? I will be staying at the Chapleau Lodge has any body stayed with them before?Thanks"
1215825,jaggersr,2010-07-04 08:33:00,44,"Sorry, I have never stayed at Chapleau Lodge or fished Borden Lake. I have fished all around it and was in the area in early June and will be heading back to the Chapleau area in early May. Water levels were extremly low, but fishing was good. On another note the black flies were gone. First time in 25 years to Canada that my wife and I came home with NO bug bites."
1216983,Wall_Eye,2010-07-07 18:50:00,28,Anybody fishing in this area or am I going to have it all to myself.Still have 45 days to wait but the anticapation is building...
1216998,Golden Eagle,2010-07-07 19:28:00,2642,Be careful not to peak too early. Good luck on your trip. I'll bet your camp owner will give you a report a few days before you head out of your driveway.
1217527,youngcanadianguide,2010-07-09 09:26:00,60,"Hey guys Sorry about my long time of no post but I'm back to do another report. The water is low and about 75 degrees. The fishing has really picked up. Just about any bait live or artificial is working. The walleye are shallow during the evening and 20 feet during the day. Pike and bass are a real blast right now. There sitting in about 6 feet of water. I have been taking a few groups each week and have been catching anywhere from 40 to 80 fish in about 4 hours per trip. They have been the same just about any bait but twisty tails on a jig have been great just tip with a night crawler or leech and enjoy. The whitefish are done. The mayflies are done hatching. The whitefish will be back in September. The lake trout are doing great if you troll in 35 to 40 feet of water off a deep edge. Trolling at about 1.8-2.2 miles an hour. Williams Wabler about 4 inches and silver tipped with a large minnow is working.I have seen loads of wildlife this year. Lots of cows with their calves, bald eagles, bears and a few wolves. The blueberries are starting to show up and the raspberries are starting to ripen slowly. Next week looks like weather in the high 70's.Our education about conservation is really paying off this year big time. A lot of nice quality fish were C&R last week. A big part of this is happening because of our fisherman who agree with conservation. Out of over 320 fishermen this year only 1 walleye over 20 inches has been harvested. and no pike over 28 inches has been kept, and very few bass over 14 inches have been filleted. I think this is great and I want to encourage everyone to fish with conservation in mind."
1217558,Wall_Eye,2010-07-09 11:28:00,28,Glad you got back to posting and thanks for the great report. Sounds like I will be in for a great time.
1220285,EyeBanger,2010-07-18 11:44:00,23,"Just got back from the Chapleau area - Prairie Bee Lake to be exact. It got up to around 90 on Tuesday which made for slow fishing, but on the other hand it was a nice warm rain most of the day on Thursday which really turned the fish on. All in all, the fishing was decent during the day and very good most evenings. We were fishing for walleye, but caught a large number of good sized smallies along with a few smaller pike. The walleyes and bass had lots of some kind of dark water bug in their guts, but still bit pretty well. Jigs with leeches or crawlers worked the best."
1220309,Wall_Eye,2010-07-18 13:56:00,28,"Thanks for the update,Glad to hear you had a good time and caught lots of fish.What color and size of jigs were you using and what depth did you catch your fish at? Also how was the lake levels and clarity?Thanks again I have 34 more days before it is my turn."
1220438,3M TA3,2010-07-18 20:16:00,2846,August? I'm going up on the 14th for a week. Been doing the same week for 14 years. Camping on an island. Always a hoot.
1220458,Wall_Eye,2010-07-18 21:41:00,28,"I will be there the week of the 21st. Wow camping on a Island does sound like a hoot,thats what I would do but my brother has to have accomadations.Any pointers on where and how to fish Borden Lake?"
