541835,Guest,2004-07-20 11:44:00,0,"You know all those famous Idaho potatoes? Turns out that they get a lot of their seed potatoes from Canada. That's right! When I lived in the Edmonton area a few years back, I knew a seed potatoe farmer who shipped the majority of his crop to the United States. Apparently, the cooler climate produced a better seed product. Who knew!"
541838,balsl6,2004-07-20 13:21:00,426,"If you can prove you are going to the angle they will let you bring potatoes and beef. I have been thru there 5 times this year and had potatoes and beef with every time. Lay the potatoes out where they can see them, you should not have any problems. When I cross the border I always have anything questionable right in plain sight, they will ask but hassle you over it. Be honest upfront you will not have any problems. I will be up there for the 10 days starting friday where are you staying?"
