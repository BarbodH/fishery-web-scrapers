What I got is a rejection notice on a post card (enclosed with my original forms in an envelope). THe rejection indicated that we were not qualified apparently because we were fishing. THe check box they chose indicated 'entertainment', they then penciled in 'fishing'. The real clincher was that at the bottom of the card was a note to the effect 'we hope you enjoyed your stay in Canada'! I sent the copies of a previous trip where I had a refund and asked them to explain the difference. This could raise hob with resorts if this in fact a reality. Looking for a reasonable explanation and/or $$$ Still worth the trip. TLY"
541868,retire55,2004-07-21 08:41:00,1029,"Tly: Armed with the information you provided in your post, I telephoned the Visitor Rebate Program for some assistance. It was suggested that you may be dealing with third party (A number of private companies may offer to submit the refund application on your behalf) and not the Government of Canada because, according to your post, ""What I got is a rejection notice on a post card (enclosed with my original forms in an envelope)."" The following note appears on the back of the rebate form (GST176) available at: http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pbg/gf/gst176/gst176-03e.pdf Note We do not return the receipts that are sent in with refund applications. The pamphlet for visitor rebates is available at:http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tg/rc4031/rc4031-e.html You can probably get faster satisfaction by telephoning the Visitor Rebate Program at 902-432-5608 or by emailing them at [email protected]"

This sure could mess up the tourist industry for the $$ conscience person. I am frugal but if there is a new rule, fine, I will live with it and plan accordingly on the next trip. TLY"
