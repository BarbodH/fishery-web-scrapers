541570,asu72401,2004-07-10 15:43:00,1,I'm flying in for my first canada trip in august with northernwilderness outfitters My mail system is on the blink and I can't get their e-mails. I wonder about drinking water while at Holly lake. Must I bring my own? How do the lakeside lodges get potable water? They advertise running water but how . Also why don't other people fish these lakes?Accessability probably or do they lease 'em?What gives one outfitter the right to build on these lakes? Lastly I hear you have a few insects about that time of year. Will they be unbearable at this time of year? I will bring every bug solution that I can find anyway!!!!!Sorry for the stupid questions.
541571,Guest,2004-07-10 16:28:00,0,Hello. A lot of good questions. some of the places I have been to have wells and the rest pump the water out of the lake then filter and maybe treat to some extent. I guess for hot water you are on your own. the other stuff i dont know. good luck.
541577,Atlanta Dave,2004-07-11 10:18:00,323,Asu We fish Athabasca which is huge and deep very cold water in june the camp gets the drinking water from main lake and treats it with bleach. We drink that water with no problems. In smaller lakes I would not take the chance of drinking water. We always take bottled water with. Camps have exclusive lease with the government for each particular lake. Atlanta Dave
541591,Guest,2004-07-11 20:46:00,0,"i have been on over a dozen flyouts and have never brought water. they have a solar water pump that pumps it out of the lake and i have never had a problem. most people boil the water for drinking. if you are going on a fly out you can't bring water, it wieghs 8 lbs a gallon and wieght is big money. as far as bugs just bring a can of off with about 30 or 40% deet and you will be ok. remember you are probably only allowed 80 or 100 pounds of gear on the plane, that includes food, clothes, tackle, pop or beer. pack lite"
541600,Guest,2004-07-12 07:32:00,0,I been drinking untreated lake water for about 25 years in NW Ontario......haven't been sick yet. Guess I'm lucky.. :)
541648,downriverbob,2004-07-13 13:14:00,880,I read in the Kenora paper a couple of months ago that all resorts must have a water treatment facility by the end of next year. I sound s like it's not going to be very cheap for smaller resort owners !
541811,Guest,2004-07-19 19:04:00,0,"Hey asu72, Just saw your message. We are planning on taking 2 gallon jugs of water, probably about 4 total. We realize that's 64 pounds but for the six of us we can adjust in other areas. Let's face it, how many clothes does a guy need for five days? We just like to play it safe. The water is only for drinking out on the boat. We take powdered lemonade for variety. I know their are many out there that drink the lake water without treatment but I would hate to gamble with some intestinal bug after waiting all year and spending a bunch of money on this trip. One hint we do is to pack everything in those plastic storage boxes. They stack easy and are nice for loading and unloading off the plane. I also take any and all food out of boxes and vacuum pack it or at least put in zip lock bags to cut down on weight and space. It also lessens the amount of garbage. Have a great time and be sure to let me know how your time was, as I will be there on the 17th. I'll be waiting to hear from you. Winneconne"
541814,Guest,2004-07-19 19:26:00,0,Will post immediately upon return the 12 th. It seems likewater sure is heavy to pack in.
