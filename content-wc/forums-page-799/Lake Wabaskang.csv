It is not on the map but it is just off the penninsula (to the southeast). We caught a bunch of eyes and had a few MONSTER northern follows. We tried to find it last year but couldn't. I have a buddy going up there soon. Does anyone know an easy way to find it? Better yet, if you are going there, could you give me the GPS coordinates? Thanks in advance. Stu"
