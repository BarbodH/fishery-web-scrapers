541911,Guest,2004-07-22 07:57:00,0,We camped and fished at Houghton about 9 years ago. We only stayed there 2 days but caught plenty of walleyes and some very big perch. The last 1/2 mile to the lake was down a narrow road and the pines were rubbing my truck so unless someone trimmed the branches you may not get there now. If anyone has been there lately I would also like to know.
