541812,VANT,2004-07-19 19:12:00,68,Anybody know the current situation with the road construction west of Dryden on 17? Went through there the beginning of June and it was a mess. Had some long waits due to construction. Leave again the end of this month and just trying to figure out what to take for route. Want to avoid the long waits we had earlier this year. Thanks. VANT
