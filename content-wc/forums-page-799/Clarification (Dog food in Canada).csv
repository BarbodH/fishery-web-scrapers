Carole-Lynn Pilon"" <[email protected]> 7/19/2004 1:01:40 PM > Hello, Thanks for your e-mail requesting information to bring dog food to Canada. Pet food can come into Canada as long as the dog food is commercially prepared and is in its original package and does not contain ingredients derived from Bovinae; such as cattle, bison, sheep, goats, muskox, buffalos and water buffalos. Regards, Carole-Lynn Pilon Since I got the clarification I found out that the dog food that I give to my dog is Eukanuba lamb/rice, and the lamb comes from New Zealand."
