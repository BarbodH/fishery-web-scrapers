WE NEVER CATCH THE REALLY BIG WALLEYES. (28'S, 29'S 30'S) HAS ANYONE OUT THERE EVER BEEN SUCESSFUL AT CATCHING LARGE WALLEYE ON THE RESERVOIR AND WHERE AND WHAT TIME OF YEAR"
541705,Guest,2004-07-14 20:38:00,0,"I have been to the reservoir 2 of the past 3 years with mattice Lake Outfitters. We go opening week each year. We have caught our fair share of 28""-30"" fish. The biggest fish usually come at either of the falls areas and either at dawn or dusk. That time of year the fish are stacked in the falls area river system for spawning. I'm curious to hear where on the reservoir you fish in August. How deep do you find the fish that time of year?"
541706,Guest,2004-07-14 21:29:00,0,PLease share any info you have on patterns or colors and bait selections in early August because I am going up to Ogoki next Thurs. for our first trip there. We have benn told(by the outfitter) that this is an great body of water with lots of potential! Last year we did a drive up and caught very few fish. This year I am taking my 12 yr old so I would like to make it a great trip that he will want to take every season! Please feel free to e-mail me if you can help at all. Thanx for any info!!!

Some of these spots are: 1. the west side of the rocks 3/4 mile out of the falls. 2. the honey hole 3. the small island ssw 2 miles from camp 4. the big island just south 3/4 5. the corner of the big island 4 miles down the main channel 6. the north side of the small island 5 miles down the main channel In the evening, two hours before dark, we start trolling two mile bay with shadlings and rapalas."

We were simply casting a jig and twister tail off an island where the 2 lakes meet. We've been going to Canada for 16 years, always a fly-in trip, and this year was the best. Huge walleye in great numbers. The mayflies hatched (2 weeks late) and the walleyes were gorging. Just had a ball. Doesn't matter what you throw, they'll take it. Have fun and hold on!"
