541946,Guest,2004-07-23 07:07:00,0,I take 17 out of Dryden as far as Highway 72 and it was not under construction as of last week.
541955,Guest,2004-07-23 13:15:00,0,I just flew back from our place (on Dinorwic lake) this afternoon July 23. There is no construction east of Dryden but there is work going on between Dryden and Vermillion Bay on route 17. For what it is worth I was wearing a long sleeve shirt and sweatshirt yesterday and this morning when we left it was 52 degrees. Just can't seem to warm up in that coutry this year.

When I was there the beginning of June it was in the 40's and 50's...during the day!! RAIN every day. Water 16 degrees colder than last year. Water 3' higher.
