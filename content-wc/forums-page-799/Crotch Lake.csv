541731,Guest,2004-07-16 02:57:00,0,We're headed to this southeastern Ontario lake in September and I was wondering if anyone who is familiar with this body of water had any tips or suggestions. Thanks in advance.

We always caught eyes when there,they have a slot limit of 18 to 24 inches returned,in the spring I know of guys who regularly take nice fish over the slot jigging,they have been regulars for 30 years,I troll most of the time fishing for suspended eyes over basin areas,harnesses and plugs both take fish,we regularly caught fish right in front of the resort.Smallmouth fishing is also good,One year during the opener I caught smallies on spinnerbaits during some mornings,I have fished other lakes in that area and none has the walleye quality of Crotch lake.No its not cheap to stay there but the place is alot nicer then some I've been too.I can't believe someone went to the trouble of the previous post to bash a nice,quiet resort,get a life will ya."
541803,Jig A Lowe,2004-07-19 12:26:00,87,"Thunderstick, I agree with Roughrider's comments. I have been fishing Crotch L. for appx. 14 yrs. and usually visit 3 wks. per summer. I would rate the walleye fishing as ""good"". However, one must be willing to spend some time on the lake to expect success. With that being said, I just returned from Crotch L. on Sat. The fishing was the worst that I have experienced in all these yrs. -- only 15 walleye for the entire wk. The question is why? The water levels were OK and the weather was decent. The walleyes just didn't seem to be where they usually are for this time of yr. I am returning to the Crotch this weekend for two wks. and, needless to say, I am praying that things will have picked up significantly by then. Good luck! Bulldog P.S. By the way, Thunderstick, Jrs. work great when trolled in the main basins around dusk."
541805,roughrider,2004-07-19 14:01:00,66,"Cgatski,I was there last summer,the huge baitfish spawn during last spring put a dent in the basin bite,too much bait,so we moved to deep weedbeds and longline trolled Rapala sticks with 1/8 oz wt. Pick a weedbed where the wind is blowing in,head for gull rock in the upper end,pass the shoal and keep going stright to the small bay,where the lake hooks left,good spot."
541837,Guest,2004-07-20 12:28:00,0,"Thanks for the input. Years ago I was sitting in a lodge awaiting a plane to fly us out of a certain lake in Quebec. We shared a cup of coffee with some fishermen who were on there way out, as well. All they did was whine about how terrible the fishing was, how empty the lake was, how puny the pike were and on and on and on. We nodded politely and incredulously because we had just enjoyed the best fishing week we'd ever had. (Daily limits of walleye and plenty of big northern.) Whenever I hear one of those ""lousy fishing"" reports about any lake of which I am unfamiliar, I always remember that morning in Quebec and remind myself that there are some anglers who expect 'em to jump into the boat."
541843,roughrider,2004-07-20 16:10:00,66,"I forgot the best part,you won't see any jet skies on that lake,the owners frowned on anybody bringing them and tubing is limited to just outside the resort,I never witnessed a jet ski there myself,it was heaven."
541847,Guest,2004-07-20 18:55:00,0,"I went to Crotch Lake in 2002 and 2003 and didn't have great walleye results. In 2002 we went in september and the day after we got there a huge storm rolled in putting 2-3' whitecaps rolling down the lake. It smashed their dock up pretty good. It took 3 days after that until the 'eyes started to come around. This was our first time there so we were still getting to know the lake and it's structure. By the end of the week it started to get decent, but of course we had to leave. Last year we went in August and the weather was good, but the 'eye bite was slow. I started fishing for smallies instead and found them to be very cooperative. I would like to try it again sometime in early June to see how it is then. The cabins we stayed in were very nice and I thought it was very reasonably priced. I think during certain times of the year it could be a decent lake, but not a great lake."
541863,Jig A Lowe,2004-07-21 06:19:00,87,"Well, the truth is that you may see a (very) few jet skis. Yes, Tumblehome Lodge does not allow jet skis. But, Land O'Lakes will permit them and on rare occasions one of their guests may have one. There is also a public launch on the lake where the public will occasionally put one in for a few hrs. There is also an access at the northern end of the lake where I have seen jet skis launched. BUT, THEY ARE A RARE SIGHT. In fact, when I was there last wk., I didn't see any the entire wk. And, Crotch L. is one of the most beautiful lakes in the region -- very senic, very little boat traffic, and rarely does the water get very rough. Best of all, if you hit it right and have some patience, the fishing can be very good."
