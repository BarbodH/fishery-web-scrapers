His touch with a Walleye Rod is unbelivable. I have never seen anyone catch so many fish and big fish as him. I cant tell you his name but if you see a guy that calls himself ""Vant"" you better look to the heavens and say ...Thank You ...I have seen ""The Best"""

541822,Guest,2004-07-20 06:57:00,0,"Vant, Thanks for keeping me in your ""Friend"" category. You are the best ....maybe second best when we wet a line together. CATCH AND RELEASE"
