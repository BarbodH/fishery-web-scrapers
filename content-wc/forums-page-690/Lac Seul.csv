I've been given the task to plan a 2007 ""guys"" walleye trip to Lac Seul, probably in July. I've never been to Lac Seul before so does anyone have advice on which part of the lake will take me closest to good summer time spots? Or is one area known for more hazards than another? I've read posts from people who stay on the Sioux Lookout side who boat quite a ways to their spots. How about if you stay at the Ear Falls side? Should I just plan to boat more than 10 miles from camp to find eyes on that system? Or are people doing this to escape the crowds? I have a 150 hp, so I can cover quite a bit of water but I don't really want to have to refuel my 35 gal tank before each outing. Or worse, or end up trashing my lower unit on submerged rocks.

We are close to Vaughn lake which has a later opening date and the main lake has every kind of structure within 3 miles of camp. Weeds , Sand flats, water over 50ft, Rocks steep breaks etc. Good luck in your search. Mwal"

I know it is human nature to think you must run miles to find fish, but on Lac Seul that is not necessary. There are good fish everywhere in Lac Seul, do not make it harder than it needs to be. That's my advice."

559409,fishingbuddy,2006-07-15 08:13:00,18,If you stay in the Ear falls part of Lac Suel McKensie bay and beyond would be a great area to try. Lac Suel Lodge or Scout Lake Resort or any of the reosrts in that area would be the closest to Mckensie and beyound. There are good areas to fish close to these areas also if you do not want to travel the distance. Most resort owners will point out great areas to fish close in. I just have found that the fishing has been better further out. Let me know if you need more info on areas to try.
