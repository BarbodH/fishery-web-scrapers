559353,Guest,2006-07-12 23:30:00,0,"i was sent a picture last week from a fellow pike chaser of a 54 inch, 44 pound norther pike from rainy lake. looks real authentic. being shy of the world record by only a couple pounds, there has to be a story or two out there of how the beast was caught. ?? email me if you want a copy of the picture[email protected]"
559359,Guest,2006-07-13 07:24:00,0,lots of people got that picture. I believe it is a hoax. It is a photoshop fake.
