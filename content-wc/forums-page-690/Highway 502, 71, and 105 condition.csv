559288,clemento,2006-07-12 07:22:00,48,Just returned from Sioux Lookout. Thought 502 was in good shape.
559291,Frankm,2006-07-12 07:37:00,154,I went at the end of May. 71 was fine. 105 was fine but it starting to get bad in Ear Falls. The owner at our camp said 105 has some bad spots from Ear Falls to Red Lake. We took 502 last year it was bad in the middle but otherwise ok. We were on it early in the morning and were able to use the entire road to avoid the pot holes. On the way back there was more traffic and that made it worse. I don't like the fact that there is no shoulder or really any places to stop. If you have any trouble your in deep S. We decided to go the other way on 71 this year. I like the fact that you pass through a few small towns.

I just came back from Ear Falls and the camp guests that used 502 on the way up all said they were going home on 71. The trip on 71 is about 35-45 minutes longer, but not as hard on you equipment."

I like the fact that you pass >through a few small towns. Just came back on 502 Saturday. There is one stretch in the middle that is rough, maybe 20 miles long, both north and southbound lanes. The northern end of this rough stretch is at about the 100 km marker from Ft. Frances. Agree strongly with this recommendation to go early AM and use the oncoming lane (when it is clear!) to get out of the way. We took it at 45 mph and it was OK. The rest of 502 is smooth enough, but i do wish they had at least a few more turnouts where you could let faster-moving traffic pass you."
