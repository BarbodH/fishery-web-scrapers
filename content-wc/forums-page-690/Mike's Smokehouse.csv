I thought the food was good but my vote would have to be that Famous Dave's is a little better. Just my opinion, but it is fun to try new places. Any other must eat at places between Rockford and International Falls?"

It was called the caboose--it was an old train. we use to stop there and get some bloody mary's for our hangovers and some really good food. they use to brew their own root beer and it was great. that was a must for us as well as this little ice cream shop in orr, MN. It is in a back room of a antique/gift shop. great HOME MADE ice cream--could get a 2 scoop cone for like 2 bucks. great snack on the way up."
