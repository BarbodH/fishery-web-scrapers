July was a great time for Pike in that area. Lots of nice weedbeds and most of our guys loved the Pike fishing. The Walleye bite is good in July but you have to fish more main lake structure. There are plenty of good main lake spots within 15 minutes of Black Bay. Straight south of Black bay there are several islands that have some great humps and ledges that hold summer pattern fish. The old river channel runs through that area down the center of Aldous Bay and it forms drop offs adjacent to islands that are great spots. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
559393,tjsker,2006-07-14 10:02:00,301,Were you using jig & worm/minnow combinations or live bait rigging?
559394,Mike Kansas,2006-07-14 10:13:00,1463,"tjsker, Jig/ Worm...Jig/Minnow....Jig/Leech.....BB with all three. In July I like the Leech because it survives the warmer temps and has always worked well in July.....20'+ water in July. Are you going this year? I would be happy to send you a map with some spots. Contact me or email me your address. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
559408,fishingbuddy,2006-07-15 08:02:00,18,Been fishing Lac Suel the past 8 years now. Boy are you in for a treat. We have been taking the houseboat out of Whitewing resort the past four years now and fishing the area around Windigo point and beyond. The time of year you are going in the later part of June is worth the trip to McKensie Bay if you have the boat worthy of the trip. Whatever way you like to fish you will catch a lot of fish. I usually fish rigs tipped with leeches and bottom bouncers with spinners and crawlers. If you need some more info on areas to fish at that time of year please let me know.
