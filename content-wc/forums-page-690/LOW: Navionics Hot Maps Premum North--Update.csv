559392,Guest,2006-07-14 09:14:00,0,"I purchased the Navionics Hot Maps Premium North Chip. Its date was Jan 2006. Noted that Lake of the Woods map did not include the designations for rocks awash or rocks just under the surface. (Neither did Rainy). I filed a descrepancy report for LOW with Navionics early this year and recently received notification that the descrepancy for LOW was corrected. Navionics exchanged my Jan 2006 for the following labeled chip. ""Navionics HotMaps Premium North SD/Prem-N2 Apr 2006."" On that chip the rocks awash and rocks just under the surface are now noted as they are on the Canadian Hydrographic Maps and on my 2004 Lake of the Woods Navionics chip that I had purchased in the meantime (that chip is no longer in the Navionics catalog.) I was not charged for the updated chip. Now wish I had included Rainy in my desrepancy report."
