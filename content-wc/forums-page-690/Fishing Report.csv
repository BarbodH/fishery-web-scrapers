Caught lots of smallmouth on 1/2 a crawler and 1/8 oz jigs working the rocky shore lines. Walleye were pretty good. Some were close to shore while others were in the mid lake humps around 20-25 feet deep. Northerns were challenging. Caught most of mine while jigging for walleye and bass. Picked up a few off shore using spinner baits. Two muskies were hooked by our group. One a 35"" fish caught on a bucktail and the other was 50""+ that grabbed a perch while we were jigging. The big one came up to the boat three times but with only 6lb test and no net big enough, she ended up breaking the line. Wingmann"
