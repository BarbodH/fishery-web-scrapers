I watched the same thing go on for over a 1/2 hour one time as the fish moved in a semi-circle around a bay. It was totally uninterested in hitting a lure thrown close to it as well. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
559444,Guest,2006-07-16 17:12:00,0,I have seen this behavior before from both Pike and muskie. Some people refer to it as porposing (sp?).

559451,Guest,2006-07-17 08:06:00,0,"I was told by my grandfather, that large musky and pike will frequently do this while digesting a large amount of food. I don't know if it's true or not, but I've also noticed that they are not interested in striking a lure at these times. I was told by a biologist here in IL that they often lay about a foot under the water and hardly move--and that's when they are vulnerable to being hit by boat traffic, since they are very lethargic. I don't know how true that is too, but I've seem some big northern and musky with nasty gashes on their backs and tails. It is strange and wierd to watch. Chuck"
559473,Capn Hooker,2006-07-17 18:28:00,333,Saw this while night fishing on Cass Lake. My son shined a flashlight on it and it swam towards us where he scooped it up with a net. I made him put it back in the water.
