559354,goater32,2006-07-12 23:44:00,8,I'll be headed up the first week in august. Was wondering if it is more of a rock pattern or weed pattern? Thanks for any advice. We always seem to see people bringin in big pike but only managed one ourselves ove the past couple years. Fishing the winnipeg river as it dumps into manitoba if that helps any.

559372,Guest,2006-07-13 12:49:00,0,"If you're after a really big fish then you have to pay attention to the details. Cabbage grass is good especially around the edges seems to work best in July. I have fished pike off ledges and rocky points but mostly in September. I like to look for stream feeds into the lake where the out wash makes a good silt bed for the cabbage grass. If you find good cabbage you probably find good pike. Setup down wind and let the drift take you across the patch. This lets you cast over a large area on a productive spot without spooking the fish. I also wear camo to avoid spooking the fish and try not to make a lot of boat noise. Then you can experiment with color and presentation until you find something that works. I'd keep an eye open for minnows jumping which is a good indication that something bigger is chasing them. A pair of polaroid sun glasses will help you to see fish in the water or following your lure in. I seem to do better on sunny days with a little wind than on cloudy or flat water days. Of course it may be that I'm chasing walleys on those cloudy days and don't fish as much for pike. Good Luck,"

559306,Guest,2006-07-12 12:19:00,0,"What a great time for Pike, wish I was going with you. You're on target with the spinner baits so here is what else I would bring. Cabella's Canadian Spoons 3/4-7/8 oz (five of diamonds, red/white, black/white, nickle) lighter than similar brands but you can fish them on slower retrieve. They are absolutely deadly on big pike. Just retrieve them slow through the top of the weed beds. Tip them with a white split tail pork trailer if the pike are finicky. The wig wag on the trailer drives those pike crazy. You can't go wrong with some jointed Rapala's 6"" (DB-13 i think) is good in perch, shad or fire tiger colors. Grandma in 6"" is excellant with a floppy side to side motion that immitates a crippled whitefish. If you're trolling then reef runner and the musky believer are good in 6"" varieties. Lots of other deep lipped crank baits will work here as well such as hot-n-tots, thunderstick, walleye divers, shad raps etc. Have fun."

559307,Guest,2006-07-12 12:21:00,0,I forgot to mention that you can spray your spoons with WD-40. Keeps them shiney and I seem to get more bites on as well. Good Luck.
