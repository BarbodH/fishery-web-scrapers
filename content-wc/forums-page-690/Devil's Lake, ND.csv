Pike, smallies and Musky are supposed to be good too. Any comparisions to Lac Seul (fishing wise)? I know that Devil's Lake is populated, bars/restaurants, campgrounds, cabins...etc. So, it's not nearly as remote as Canada. Thanks."

559428,FuzzyIL,2006-07-16 10:24:00,906,"Just got back yesterday from a week at DL. Great fishery and great time. We stayed at a resort in Minnewauken about 20 miles west of the town of Devil's Lake. People are very nice there and helpful. DL has all ammenities, Walmart, fast foods, stores, etc. Gas stations outside of DL are sparse so gas up truck and boat before you head up 281 - trust me on that one. We fished areas only on the west side of the lake and caught fish literally every place we stopped and dropped a jig or threw cranks. All week long. Wind is key to the best bites. No wind - tougher bite. Caught walleyes everywhere. Pike almost everywhere and whites along the rocks along 19 and 281 (depending on wind direction). Biggest walleye was 6 1/2 lb and had lots of 17 to 20 inch 'chunks'. No big pike. Biggest WB was 17 inches. We fished trees mostly. Just about any tree group that had 10 feet or more held fish. Some trees were better than others. I used the trolling motor to navigate in the trees as we dropped jigs and crawlers into pockets next to the trees. The better fish seemed to come from spots that had two stumps about 3 feet apart and were short stumps giving little shadow (but who knows). Most guys tie up to trees and slip bobber leeches. Saw that many did well also. Not all though. I prefered to hunt for the fish in trees with the trolling motor(really sharpens your boat control skills) rather than wait for the fish come to us. DL is not as remote as Canada but similar to Lac Suel in that you may see other boats but you can fish alone just about anywhere. Had some MWC pre-fishers move in on two of our spots on Friday when they saw us land walleyes. We made a decision NOT to troll all week since we troll so much locally and on other trips. That may have been a mistake, but we still caught fish. One of the guys at the bait shop said 'everything works' - meaning trolling, rigging, jigging, slip bobbering, throwing cranks, etc - he was right. We will return next year, but man what a long drive! When on plane - do not take you eyes of what is in front of you - be constantly aware of dead heads and stumps - they are everywhere or so it seems."
