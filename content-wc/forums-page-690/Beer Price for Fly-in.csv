559399,Guest,2006-07-14 13:03:00,0,"Ok, it is not a fly-in beer story but pretty darn close. The Canadian case. At a remote lake in Northern Saskatchewan one group of guys I fish with ran out of beer on Wednesday. The nearest source of beer was some 60 km or 36 miles drive over rough gravel and logging roads to a small outpost type general store. The three of them decided it was worth it to make the trek. Upon arriving they asked the owner, ""How much for a case of beer?"" The owner replied; ""$45.00"". The three of them discussed the price, thinking it a bit too expensive but then they each chipped in anyway to come up with the cash. After receiving the cash the store owner pulls out a 12-pack and hands it over. One of the guys ask; ""Hey, is this all!"" The store owner said; ""Yes, that is what you get. If you don't like it you can drive on up the road, there's another place in about another 180 Km. Aye!"" Don't know if it tasted any better or not because they weren't sharing any of it."
