559454,Guest,2006-07-17 09:29:00,0,We use L&M Fly In Outposts on Clearwater Lake for our fly in fishing trips. There son just started getting his own operation and is the one I believe you are referring to. He has been in the business with his family for 15-20 years and we deal with him on all of our trips. I'm sure he will take care of you and that the cabin & equipment will be good shape and he will treat you right. Good luck.
