529721,Guest,2003-04-16 19:41:00,0,Roger......thanks. Turns out that if your a property owner in Ontario (which I am) and aren't a Canadian citizen you can camp with a permit up there.
529722,River_eye,2003-04-16 22:13:00,1486,Where do you get these permits? What's the cost range?
529723,Guest,2003-04-17 06:41:00,0,"Rivereye.......correction to what I wrote above. If you are a property owner in Ontario and are a nonresident of Canada you do NOT need a permit to camp. To answer your question, permits can be bought from most fishing liscense dealers or regional MNR offices. The cost is $10 CAN per day per person."
529724,Guest,2003-04-19 05:59:00,0,I saw a lodge listed for sale on a realtor's site and it is on your lake. Is your lodge for sale? Do you have walleye fishing? Why are you selling?
529725,Guest,2003-04-19 21:27:00,0,"It is possible you saw an old listing by Latitude 50, we do not have a realator listing it at this time. We are planning to sell. We purchased South Bay Lodge with the intent of running it for 10 years, selling, and financing it for the purchasers (my retirement plan) for about 10 years and that would get me to the age of official retirement! The main lake is known for big pike and lake trout fishing. We have several smaller portage lakes (boat caches) on walleye lakes that are accessed through our lake. We are the only lodge fishing on Confederation Lake 14,000 acres. Kabeelo Fly out service on bottom of the lake has a base there but their guests are flown out to their outpost cabins/lakes. I will always return here, and want to remain to some degree involved in the future of the lodge. We have moose tags and a Bear management area so offer hunting also. If you are interested further email me direct at [email protected] roger"
529709,River_eye,2003-04-11 09:23:00,1486,Wondering if any of you knew anything about remote campsites on Confederation lake. My uncle used to have a cabin on the lake till he sold it at least 12 years ago. I have only childhood memories of the place and I'd like to pull a little boat or canoe up there somtime and check it out.Any info is appreciated.
529710,Guest,2003-04-15 06:55:00,0,"Eric, as you probably know I own South Bay Lodge on Confederation Lake....the lodge used to operate a camp ground over by the old mine site but the land use permit was not renewed before I purchased the lodge and thus the old camp ground disappeared. Crown Land surrounds the lake and it is a designated ""no camping"" by non-residents. Some locals still come up on long weekends and camp at the old mine site. No boat ramps, so they have to just carry them in or back them onto the old beach. It is kind of a good deal for me that camping is not allowed on the lake but bad for others. ro"
529711,River_eye,2003-04-15 10:25:00,1486,no boat ramp anymore? What happened to it?
529713,Guest,2003-04-15 11:45:00,0,"Roger......can you elaborate a bit more on your comment: ""Crown Land surrounds the lake and it is a designated ""no camping"" by non-residents"". Who designated it ""no camping"" ? It has always been my understanding that if you are a non resident you only needed a camping permit from the MNR to camp on crown land north of the English River. What is the special circumstance with regards to camping on Confederation Lake? THX"
529714,Guest,2003-04-15 18:23:00,0,"On lakes and land that there are no ""Licensed Tourist"" operators you may purchase a camping permit for Crown Land, but where there are lodges like mine non-residents are not allowed to camp. Non-residents may fish there on a daily basis without restrictions but are not permitted to set up camps etc...There are signs along the road and at the old site of South Bay mine that are posted by the Ministry of Natural Resources. ro"
529712,Guest,2003-04-15 18:26:00,0,"I got there in 1996 and there was not a ramp then, locals back their trailers off the beach into the lake. I have a ramp at my parking lot that I pay a Land Use Permit for but it is private and for guests of South Bay Lodge."
529715,River_eye,2003-04-15 19:41:00,1486,"That would be non-residents of Canada then right? Or is it non-residents of Ontario.I believe there were some old buildings just across the channel from my uncles cabin, and I always thought that this was the old mine site. Are there many deserted properties out there?"
529718,Guest,2003-04-16 06:28:00,0,Roger.......I hate to keep bothering you but I did some research on the MNR site and could find nothing that has backed up what you have said. Do you have a phone number of someone I can call at the MNR or can you direct me to this regulation (#)? Not that my curiosity relates directly to Confederation Lake but I've gotten camping permits for years from the MNR to camp on the Winnipeg river system where there are several liscenced tourist operators without ever having a problem. Thanks for your help
529719,Guest,2003-04-16 16:32:00,0,MNR phone in Red Lake = 807-727-2252
529716,Guest,2003-04-16 16:36:00,0,"Eric, I believe it is non-residents of Canada, because I know a couple guys from Winnipeg that have camped on Confed. What was your uncles name? There are 6-7 private cabins on the lake (mostly in Lost Bay, SE section of the lake....near the old abandoned Uchi gold mine) There's several old mine sites in the area, most closed down in the early 30-40's."
