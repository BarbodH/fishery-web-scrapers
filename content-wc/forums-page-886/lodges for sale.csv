529865,alan ex pup,2003-04-20 06:50:00,126,I have no interest in purchasing any but on a previous post it was mentioned tha timberlane was for sale and a couple of others and I was just wondering what others and maybe why they are for sale. Is this normal or are things so difficult for the owners ?
