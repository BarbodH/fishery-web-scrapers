529808,Guest,2003-04-14 09:42:00,0,Going to Lac Seul for the first time. What is the best bait in June and what techniques work best. We will be there the second week of June....Thanks
529809,Guest,2003-04-14 10:51:00,0,"Best bait>the one that catches fishBest method>see aboveSeriously,Do a search on LS. You will find MANY posts concerning who/what/where.Fished this lake for 25+ weeks over the last 9 years and can catch fish on all the normal walleye methods. You will get people telling you jigs/spinners/cranks/live bait/twister tails etc. They all will work. What method do you like to use? Do that cause of your comfort level.Colors>stick with oranges/chartruse/lime greens/gold and glow white. These predominate colors in jigs/spinners or cranks will work fine on LS and catch fish. Best o luck"

529811,Rick,2003-04-14 18:56:00,226,Whatever bait you have left. You can use any bait on this lake. Minnows leechs crawlers. At this time of year minnows are most popular though.
529812,Fred,2003-04-14 20:00:00,32,"Fished NE Lac Seul 30 yr. Two three times a year.Best now for years. we like to go from third wk to Sept. 21. Second week they can still be scattered after spawn. In the Souix Lookout area many walleye traveled to the north feeder rivers to spawn and large numbers may only be down to Chamberland Narrows. As for bait Heres what we have found. Years ago a american guide told us the Walleyes up here don't know want leaches are. Thats not to say you can,t catch a lot of eyes on them. But we have tested them against minnows while ontop of big schools, the minnows easily got more fish. Check some of the warm bays at about six feet. Also fish rocky shore lines with bass plugs, you'll catch Bass, Walleyes and Northern. This casting to shore has proved to be much more productive than trolling a lure behind the boat."
529813,Guest,2003-04-15 11:51:00,0,Fred..........When I'm up in Ontario banging the banks with my bass plugs catching everything under the sun the locals look at my like I don't know how to fish. Why is that? :)
529814,Guest,2003-04-15 12:23:00,0,"Aaron Indiana......Because they recognize that a Southren Boy is catching fish in a most unlikely manner. Most of the Canadians believe in fishing with lots of lead for Walleye and lots of shiny steel for Pike. So you Aaron,look out of place. But keep catching ....they will learn."
529815,Guest,2003-04-15 20:28:00,0,Would a top water bait work well for pike on Lac seul im going there at the last week of June at the ear falls area. And if so what kind
529816,Guest,2003-04-17 07:35:00,0,Yes I have used them and they work fine. For Northerns it seems at tme that any lure will work.
