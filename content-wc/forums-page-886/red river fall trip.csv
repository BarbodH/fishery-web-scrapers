We typically stay ""super 6"" type places and Daerwood has been very accomdating to our fishing needs. If you fish the red, be prepared to make the drive to pine falls. The last two years the red has been very slow, but Pine Falls fairly good. Last year everyone came home with atleast an 8 pounder, 4 of us with 10 plus.Another really nice gentleman who frequents this board turned me on to this place and was amazingly helpful with Info on everything. He goes by the name ""Todd_NE"" on this board. Look for him, do search, or post a question for him. I can assure you he is a real sportsman who helps out other fisherman.I have been fishing up there for the last 2 years and if I can help you out with anything email me at [email protected]."
