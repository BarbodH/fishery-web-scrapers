529931,Gate Keeper,2003-04-19 20:21:00,5,"You need to stop a Crawling Valley, just east of Calgary. Approximately 1 hour drive and just off the N0.1 Highway. ""Catch and Release Lake"", Season opener is May 8, 2003. Edmonton's hot spot is Pigeon Lake, "" Catch and Release Lake"" as well. Approximately 1 hour soouthwest of Edmonton, just before you reach Edmonton. Both Lakes have the best walleye fishing the Province provides, with many walleyes in the 10-15 LB class, but this early into the season will have it challenges.A third lake that supports a tremendous walleye fishery close to Calgary is Traver's Reservoir. Approximately 1 1/2 hours Southeast of Calgary. This time of the season you will want to fish at the rivers mouth or the slide that feeds Traver's Reservoir. And really depending where you are coming from. The Medicine Hat and Lethbridge area also offer some tremendous walleye Lakes, that just opened this season for keepable walleyes. They have lakes that provide a excellant source of Large walleyes to be had."

It is currently a catch and release lake, but it has more big walleyes in it than you can fathom. All that is required is gold jigs with white Berkely power grubs. Will be heading there again for the third year straight to fish it the first part of June. It is a don't miss bite and kept somewhat quiet by the locals...."
