529892,Guest,2003-04-16 14:13:00,0,"Thanks for your input. I am asking a legitimate question and am hoping for a straight forward answer. Sorry for any confusion.I honestly thought I caught a glimpse of something about Canadian Elections on the news last night on one of those reader boards at the bottom of the TV screen, but missed the first part.I am not Canadian but I try and follow Canadian current events as I believe these events are important.Keep on fishing Sam. I wish I was.:)"
529893,IaDave,2003-04-16 14:53:00,476,In the general discussion section of WC go back about 3 pages and there is an extensive thread on this.
529894,Guest,2003-04-16 15:08:00,0,Thank you IaDave.
529895,Fred,2003-04-16 16:38:00,32,"Yes you are right.The Liberals defeated the P.Q.That means for the next 4 years we don't have to think about Quebec wanting to seperate from Canada.Good for Quebec,great for Canada."
529896,Guest,2003-04-16 16:48:00,0,The Liberals are going to formalize all of our issues with Quebec. The Quebecois came within a hairs breath of leaving Canada. This is the greatest news for Quebec and Canada. The language laws will be slackened and Engish people may actually get equal treatment. I hear in Quebec that if you don't speak French you cannot take a limit of Walleye. You get the English Limit which is half the French limit.........
529897,Guest,2003-04-17 13:02:00,0,"Exactly my thoughts. This is good news, in my opinion, at least.Thanks for the information."
