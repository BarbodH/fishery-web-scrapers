529666,Minnow Man,2003-04-09 20:02:00,85,"Hello BruceWeather here in Red lake was in the high 60's to-day. Maybe even in the 70's. Worked in the yard most of the day in a short sleeve shirt. Chukuni River where it crosses the hwy 105 is wide open. Lots of open water around the Balmertown Bridge ( Red Lake). Watched a truck drive on Howey Bay this afternoon and it was running in a couple inches of water. Gullrock lake has lots of water on the ice, no snow left. Will be visiting at Snake Falls Camp this weekend and can give lake conditions on Pakwash then. Should be a normal ice out, unless mother nature gets cruel. Hope this helps. If you like I can take some photos of the ice conditions, and send them to you if you care to give your email address.Have a good one."

529668,Guest,2003-04-10 06:05:00,0,Bruce do you also fish on Gullrock? I have been thinking of giving it a try.

529669,Bruce,2003-04-10 20:13:00,48,Never fished Gull Rock but have heard all good news from there.Gull Rock water flows into Pakwash probably same type of fishingin each. Great eye fishing in Pakwash.I would recomend either.Go for it!
529671,Bruce,2003-04-17 18:43:00,48,"Minnow Man,Did you get over to Pakwash last weekend and look at the ice??"
529672,Minnow Man,2003-04-17 20:29:00,85,"Hello BruceDidn't make it to Snake Falls Camp. Rob & Nancy came over to our place for a visit. Told them about you, they new who you were and said to say ""HI"". Robs said the ice on Chukuni River was melted & the area around his docks were ice free, and you could now fish in the bay in front of camp. We did get a few inches of the white stuff to-day. It will probably all melt in a day or so. Looks like a normal ice out year. Hope this helps."
529673,Bruce,2003-04-18 10:41:00,48,Thanks for the info.
