529758,FOOTDOC,2003-04-12 18:59:00,139,My friends and I are looking for a good walleye/northern lodge in either Ontario or Manitoba that has a solid runway. We are hoping to fly direct from the US to this lodge. We are hoping for the first week in July. Thanks for the information.

529760,Guest,2003-04-13 13:44:00,0,You can fly to Baudette Minnesota which is 45 minutes from Buena Vista Resort on Lake of the Woods. The website is buenavistaresort.com. We have guests who fly out Chicago and I can put you in contact with them if you want some info on the runway. The first few weeks of July is the best walleye fishing on our area of Lake of the Woods. The walleyes are on the reefs then.

Most camps in the area will usually pick you up at your plane and transport you to the camp and return. Give us a call at camp or check the municipal website to get info; great access to the entire area for any flyboys."
529762,ILSTECH,2003-04-17 10:29:00,53,I would think your trip would be interrupted by a visit with the customs folks. Can't say they are willing to travel to just any ole lodge. RW
