Looking for everyone's opinion on what the best minnow to use might be. I can get either large suckers or large lake shiners. Where we fish you can't use smelt, so that is not an option.In the past we have always used the suckers and have done pretty well. I'm just looking for some opinions. ThanksAdam"

I can't get them here but I always thought that a big 'ol whitefish would be cool to soak for early pike. Probably illegal, though.Who are you flying out with and to what lake?- Rick"
