529928,Thumper,2003-04-18 06:27:00,133,I've wondered why the camp operators don't supply nets with the boats. Is it a liability issue? Something else? I wouldn't think it much of a cost issue when you can get nets for as cheap as $10 at discount department stores. Then if the anglers wanted they could bring up their $100 super fancy nets if the cheapies weren't good enough. :)
529929,Guest,2003-04-18 08:58:00,0,"Outfitters don's supply nets, because fishermen go thru them too fast. We did a fly-in on the Attawapiskat where the outfitter provided nets. There was a guide at the camp whose biggest job seemed to be to make sure we didn't lose/ruin his nets. We were careful, but with the big Pike on that lake, we broke one (rookie lifting from the end of the handle) and one mysteriously disappeared (overboard?, snagged in a tree?, no one ever fessed up). The nets sure were a touchy issue by the end of the week. When we flew out, the guys coming in had two brand new nets with them (the guide radioed to Nakina to send more up). We still laugh about the nets on that trip."
