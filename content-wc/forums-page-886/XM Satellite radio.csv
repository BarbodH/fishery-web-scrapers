529817,IaDave,2003-04-14 10:37:00,476,I just purchased XM radio for my truck & a portable boombox. It works great when you are camping or fishing here in th USA. Will I be able to receive the signal in Canada or once I cross the border it automatically loses the signal? Anybody have XM outr there.
529818,Sparky,2003-04-14 11:04:00,796,"From the XM website:Is XM Service available in Canada and Mexico?XM is only licensed to provide service to the US (All states except Alaska and Hawaii), its territories and adjacent waters. XM's satellite signal reaches into portions of Canada and Mexico near the U.S. borders however, XM's service is not currently sold in Canada, Mexico or any other region outside of the continental United States."
529819,McQ,2003-04-14 12:04:00,615,I would think that if you can acquire the signal from the satellite you would have no problems. I don't know the path of the satellite so I'm sorry for such a vague answer but as long as the orbit is above the horizon my presumtion is no problem to receive.
529820,Sparky,2003-04-14 12:26:00,796,"The satellite broadcasters have the ability to direct their signal in a fairly narrow region, thats why it only goes a limited distance into Canada. Think of the light of a candle vs. a flashlight. You can broadcast radio waves the same way, either a narrow focus or a wide dispersion. Fairly narrow region is relative. For example, if you wanted to cover Illinois, you'd also be covering parts of Indiana, Missouri, Michigan, Wisconsin, and all other bordering states. If I had to guess, I say they can narrow it to within about 25-50 miles, but thats just a WAG, wild a$$ guess."
