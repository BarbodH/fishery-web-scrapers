529867,Guest,2003-04-16 06:35:00,0,Going to Canada for the first time and would like to hear if you guys think I will be equipped right. Not sure what Rod and line is best for jigging and trolling could use your suggestions. We are taking 1/4 and 3/8 oz leadheads in varity of colors and we bought some bottom bouncers with Lindy Rigs. We also have a assortment of Rapala Crankbaits. We are planning on having minnows and Nightcrawlers. We also have a 18 ft boat with GPS and Depth Finder and have ordered lake maps.We are fishing Lac Seul the last week of June out of the Ear Falls area. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

General regulations are available on-line at:http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/pubs/fi...r2003_Info.pdfRegulations specific to the Lac Seul area are on-line at:http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/MNR/pubs/fi...r2003_MapE.pdfAnother web site that provides good fishing advice for north western Ontario is http://www.justfishontario.com/disc54_toc.htmAs to your specific questions, I would recommend that you take along lighter jigs (e.g. 1/16 th and 1/8 th ounce) as well as the ones you mentioned. You should have 1,2 and 3 ounce bottom bouncer weights. Most of the time, you'll probably use 2 ounce weights to fish at 20 feet. You might also consider some very light wire hooks for drifting leeches. Have a good trip."
