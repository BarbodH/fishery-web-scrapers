529748,Guest,2003-04-16 07:52:00,0,"Guys, I was making a joke off of alan's comment that these people from Kansas try to be slick (see post # 5). Didn't mean to imply anything about these specific owners....just that people from Kansas are pretty sly and cunning compared to people from New York City perhaps, who are salt of the earth and would give you the shirt off their back. As for Toto, those Kansas dogs are wise beyond their years."
529749,Guest,2003-04-16 09:23:00,0,rockpt- Thanks for the clarification. I asked because of bad past experiences... we were on a fly-on and the care-taker had a beggar lab - it was cute on day one but he was in your faceconstantly looking for a mooch everytime you left the cabin. I love dogs but he was a bit too much. Keep the net wet!
529737,Guest,2003-04-11 09:38:00,0,Anyone ever stay at this place? Is it decent? Looking for info.
529738,Vitreum,2003-04-11 10:05:00,221,"fuzzy, i've stayed there. it's ok. nothing fancy, but more than adequate. appliances worked, good bathrooms in the cabin. boats were fine and ran well. good guy runs it for an absentee owner. price is right. lots of great fishing nearby. about 5 minutes drive to ear falls."
529739,Guest,2003-04-11 13:14:00,0,Thanks Vitrium -that's what we were looking for - adequate it justfine
529740,Guest,2003-04-11 15:44:00,0,"Unless there's been some changes since last fall, that camp has been treated pretty rough and the equipment has been well used. It appeared to me that very little if anything was put back into the camp. Don't be expecting much."
529741,Vitreum,2003-04-11 16:43:00,221,"look again, i said adequate. i've stayed in some real dumps in canada. this place was ok. no problems here."
529742,alan ex pup,2003-04-14 00:08:00,126,"we used to to stay there with the previous owners glen and delores I think, they were canadians and real nice. The year following the purchase by the present owners we got their brochure saying they had actually lowered some prices. Well we had the previous years brochures and they had raised all the prices! These people were friends of some other american lodge owned place because their winter address was in the same townin Kansas I think. these people try to be slick. it was a nice place with the cabins and all I dont know about now."
529743,Guest,2003-04-15 06:50:00,0,"I heard the camp was for sale,anybody know if it is?"
529744,Vitreum,2003-04-15 14:42:00,221,"yes, it is for sale along with 1 or 2 other lac seul lodges."
529745,Guest,2003-04-15 14:51:00,0,Those Kansans are pretty slick....watchout for them and their dog Toto.
529746,Vitreum,2003-04-15 15:29:00,221,"not so sure how slick he is. it's still for sale, last i heard. looks a little pricey considering the work needed to bring it back up to snuff. think i read it'll need a new septic system and well to pass the new environmental laws."
