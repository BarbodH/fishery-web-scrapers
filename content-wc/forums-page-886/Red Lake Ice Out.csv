529845,Guest,2003-04-15 08:37:00,0,Can anyone tell me how much ice there is on Red Lake? Any guesses when we'll have ice out there? My guess is May 5th.ThanksAdam
529846,Guest,2003-04-15 11:48:00,0,It's anyones guess as to when the ice will be out. I've seen 30 inches of ice take only a couple days to clear off the lakes with 70-80 degree days and a lot of wind. It's all gonna depend on the weather.
529847,Guest,2003-04-15 18:54:00,0,I live in Red Lake and was out for the last day of the ice fishing season yesterday and there is still over 35in. of ice on all the lakes up here. my ? May 6th
529848,Thumper,2003-04-16 07:19:00,133,"My guess is the big concern on Red Lake ice out is due to last year's Walleye opener taking place when there was still ice in the lake.My question is, how many times has that happened in the past? Or was last year a freak occurance?"
529849,Guest,2003-04-16 18:35:00,0,A friend of mine up here has kept a record of when the ice has gone out since 1931.The only years he didn't have recorded was 47-54. The has gone out after May 17th 7 times and before May 1st 8 times I can tell you that up here the fish are staging in the pre spawn areas and they are full of eggs.
