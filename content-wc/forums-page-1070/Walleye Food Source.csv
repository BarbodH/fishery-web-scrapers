508084,Randy,2000-05-31 08:03:00,53,I am packing for June 7 trip to the Woman River area (NE of Ear Falls). Do crayfish exist this far north? I have several crayfish crankbaits and am wondering if I should leave them home. What are the major food sources for walleye this far north?
508085,Chevy,2000-05-31 20:55:00,5,"Yes, there are crayfish this far north. In order of effectiveness the following baits proved best for me at Red Lake which is near where you are headed. Jigs tipped with a minnow are tops. Jigs tipped with worms are also popular. Small spinners with minnows, leeches or worms are a close second, popular for trolling with the locals. After these two choices which never fail, I would use a crankbait only if fishing after sundown or possibly trolling. Frankly, the jigs and spinners work so well that my crankbaits are usually left at home. I know this stategy sounds odd if you fish the big lakes, but for inland lakes, jigs and spinners out produce anything else. Good luck and enjoy the trip."
