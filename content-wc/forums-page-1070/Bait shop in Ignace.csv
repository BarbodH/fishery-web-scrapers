(This is the south or west side of the road) Last year we picked up leeches in Thunder Bay, but had a heck of a time finding a bait shop. Then stopped in Ignace for fuel and found this bait shop had some nice leeches. Nice shop but didn't write the name down.Or... location of an easy to find bait shop in Thunder Bay. Thanks.Pooch"
