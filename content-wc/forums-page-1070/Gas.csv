508057,Guest,2000-06-01 13:49:00,0,"OK, how many liters in a gallon? The last three posts all have something different, from 2.7 to 3.8 to 4.45."
508058,jimbo,2000-06-01 17:33:00,223,hope this helps--------to convert liters to gallons multiply by .2642.
508059,Paul H,2000-06-02 12:08:00,1232,if it is .73 Can per liter that is $1.87 US equiv.Exchange rate is 1.48 per US dollar.I've got a spreadsheet set up to do it (I'm lazy)Not much worse than local - Ohio at 1.67 today.Formula is (3.785*price per liter )/exchange rate )
