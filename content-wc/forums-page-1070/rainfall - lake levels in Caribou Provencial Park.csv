508082,Hammerhead Herb,2000-05-30 19:33:00,259,"Am leaving this Friday morning from Morris, IL to Ear Falls, ON and then flying into a lake in the Caribou Provencial Park. Last year the water levels were real low ( the lowest in 9 years) and it hurt the fishing (although there was a late spawn also). Does any know how the water levels are in the Gamon River flowage area. Also any tips on walleye fishing when the water levels are real low.Thanx."
