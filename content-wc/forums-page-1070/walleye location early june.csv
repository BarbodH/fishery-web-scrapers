Fish the shallow bays? Will the early spring move them deeper? Thank you!!BrianPS In relation to the beer post on this page, Canadian beer is excellent! We try to buy most of our beer after we cross the border. Good fishing to all of you!"
508024,Guest,2000-05-24 18:29:00,0,lakers are shallow this time of year 200 miles south of where youall are going. Lac Seul fishing ona 20th was great using jigs with minnies or leech. If it gets windy-find a steep dropoff from shore n cast with a jig n mr. twister. Last year I had fish on every cast where yur goig. Keep your tip up. alcy.........<}}}}}><

The weather in northern ontario is a real mixed bag this spring so anything can happen in the next couple of weeks."
