(two days of east wind) Water was very clear 10' plus you can see the bottom.Smallmouth starting to come on. Water temp 58 - 60F. smallies were in 6 - 10' boulder bottoms. Hitting on 1/8 oz jig with silver, green and brown twiter tail grubs. Just cast and swin the grub with a steady retreive. keep the rod tips low.Northerns were mostly hanging around drop offs not too many in the weeds.Going to be at Eagle nest landing in Manitoba June 3-10. In the mean time got to take care of some of this work that just gets in the way of fishing.LOL and Get Bit."
