508051,Guest,2000-05-25 08:28:00,0,"Jigging always works well in the mid-summer when fishing reefs and points with deep drop offs. Pulling spinners and lindy rigs along the outside of weedbeds on cloudy days works well. Also, long lining reefs with a naked hook and leech (or minnow) is very effective. Don't bet on hot weather in northern Ontario in mid-August. Come prepared with shorts, sun screen and your winter coat. TGG"
