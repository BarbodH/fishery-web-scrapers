507983,Guest,2000-05-20 21:50:00,0,"North Shore Lodge on Eagle Lake was great. Good food and fishing. Last year went to Hubers lodge on Lake Wabigoon/Dinorwic. It was great. We are going again in 19 days. Great food and very good fishing. The lake is smaller than Eagle Lake. Eagle lake was rough most of the time, but good Walleye fishing. Hubers in on the web if you want to look at the rates. Five of us are going this year for $380 each for 7 day trip."

507985,kingsway,2000-05-21 17:46:00,27,"Anyone wanting a great fishing experience at a very reasonable cost. Try ""The Idyllwild Resort"" on Kashabowie Lake, Ontario. Located just 65 mi W/NW of Thunder Bay, Ontario (off Hy.11). The lake is 14 mi. long has many islands, bay, and channels. The fishing there is great for Walleye, Lake Trout, Small mouth Bass, and Northern Pike. Rates for a (fully modern) 3-bedroom cabin for up to 6 persons are $450.00 per week Canadian dollars (which translates to about $320.00 American dollars total). Not per person as many places charge and then they charge American Dollars beside. For a rustic, 1 bedroom cabin that sleeps 4, the weekly rate is only $250.00 (about $180.00 American Dollars). You can bring your own boat or rent theirs. Call and talk to Sue at 1-807-926-2413 or e-mail Sue at [email protected] . I have done fly-in fishing, fished Red Lake, Ear Falls, Parroult falls, Vermillion Bay, and I would say that this place provides more bang for the American Dollar than any of the others I have tried so far. I do not have any financial interest in this lodge or any other benefit from telling about this place. I just wanted to share an excellent Canadian fishing trip that the average American can afford, with fellow fishermen Hope you enjoy your stay as well as me and my wife will June 17-23.Rich"
507987,Guest,2000-05-22 07:20:00,0,With so many differnet places to go in Canada it is hard to help you. Are you looking for a drive in or a fly-in? What is your budget? Are you after trophies or numbers? I would start with a fly-in. Typically fly-ins offer you much better fishing becasue of their remoteness. I would also find a place with a catch and release policy or a no trophy policy. I have been to two places like this and found the fishing to be 10 times better than any drive-in lake I ever been to. E-mail me if want info. on these places. Good luck

After hours of surfing and calling and EMAIL'ing I am kinda sure we are going to Manotak Lodge Perrault Falls, Ontario. #####://www.duenorth.net/manotak/ Hear is why I have chosen it:1) There is a lot of water to fish...2 lakes and a river. There are 3 camps on these water's of which this is the largest and they only have around 30 people in camp.2) It is a drive in. Some of the guys don't want to fly...afraid; also fly ins are more expensive, also fly ins tend to restrict what kind of baggage (beer) you can take...that was a problem for my croud. The great thing is for $100 you can do a 1 day fly in trip to a fly in lake...so in my opinion I'm getting the best of both worlds.3)Cabins have electric,showers, toilets, hot and cold water, microwave, toaster, coffee maker, full size fridge/stove, barbeque grill...all in all very complete accomadations as far as I have found.4) Lodge has a store, satellite TV, pool table, sun deck, card tables and ITS OPEN 24 hrs a day...nice place to go drink a few cold ones in the evenin or rainy day. They also have canoes and paddle boats available...no charge5) The have regular housekeeping plan, or just a dinner meal plan, or a full 3 meal plan. And the nice thing is everyone can do what they want. Some can be lazy and eat at the lodge all week while others cook for themselves...just depends on how much oney they want to spend.6) Boats are 16 ft aluminum, w/ 20 HP ELECTRIC START motors, swivel seats w/ cushions, etc... a upgrade boat is available.7) Free conservation fishing license is included, as well as gas, amd ice. For all there guests they provide a coleman stove and the big frying pans for shorelunches...even if your not with a guide. And I'm told the camp owner hosts a fish fry every Fiday for all the guests.The only thing I don't like is I have never been here. I did get 1 response on a posting here...feel free to check it out ...TITLE: 2001 Trip to Ontario.Lastly...the money...I have a $600 budget for this whole trip... Cabin/Boat/Gas 325 Food (we cook) 75 Car trip (gas) 50 Bait 50 (minnows $3 dz.) Misc 100 (beer) Total $600> Optional Expenses (You can do what you want): 1 day Fly In trip - $100 Dinner Meal Plan - $125 (- $35 credit for Food above) All Meal Plan - $300 (- $75 credit for Food above) Upgrade boat - $100 Guides - $50 per per/per day OK...thats what I got for ya...hope it helps. If anyone reading this has a better place for the same money I'd like to hear about it soon...gonna book as soon as I get all 14 deposits together.Please EMAIL me at [email protected] if you have any thoughts about all of this. Sorry to be so long winded, but I wanted ya to know what all went into my decision...Good luck to ya!!Moose"
507989,Guest,2000-05-23 19:23:00,0,"Thee Best all round fishing in my part of the world is STURGEON Lake on hiway 599 north of Ignace Ontaio. It has musky-northern-pickerel-pike-trout and bass. The camps go from bare min to a completely outfitted tug boat where the only thing you supply is YOU, and your prference in fish and size.The other goodie camp is Raleigh Lake ona Trans Canada West of Ignace. the camps there provide speckled trout-brown-rainbow and freshwater salmon. There are lots of hidden sand beaches and small islands to explore. The two camps are at the north end of the lake. Only one pvt camp on the east shore of 3rd lake. An real all round enjoyable lake to go tenting on."
