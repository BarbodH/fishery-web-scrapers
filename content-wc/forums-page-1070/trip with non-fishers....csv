My question is how to ensure that the 3 guys who don't necessarily fish that much have a good time. We are taking the cards, beer, and all that stuff and are only doing a 3 day trip. However - I know I want to spend a lot of time on the water - I worry that the other guys may get bored if the bite is not hot. Any suggestions? I plan on making this a yearly event, and so want it to be succesful. Has anyone else had this sort of dilemma, and how did it turn out?Thanks all...S."

This way those of you who frequently fish can practice your guiding and teaching, leaving them better prepared for future trips. By rotating partners each day, they should pick up a good knowledge base and ensure no one becomes tired of any one person."

I actually took a couple of the guys out on Saturday morning and we pulled in couple of fish - and they did well with the tackle, so are looking forward to the trip even more now - and want to go out a few more times before we head up north. Hopefully I have a couple more fishing buddies now!!! <GRIN>"
