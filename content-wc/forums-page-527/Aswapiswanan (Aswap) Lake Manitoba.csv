If so, would you say East, Central or West part of the lake is best? What about the river on the West end, the two rivers from the South or the Outflow on the East?"
1216878,Guest,2010-07-07 14:09:00,0,"My group, (all from Iowa originally), will be at Aswap 8/8/10 thru 8/15/10. We went this same week 2 years ago. We spent most of our time in the western third but I plan on spending some time in the middle section this year. The eastern third is shallower but we did catch some nice walleyes in the mouth of the outflow. (A long way to go for supper especially since it can be caught around the island in front of the cabin.) If your going to be their the week after us I'll give you an update at the dock on your way in. If your there the week before, the same would be appreciated. There a big pike in this lake and in August we caught them in both the weed beds and the rocks. They're spread out this time of year and as Trevor would tell you if your catching a lot of little ones it's time to move. We had luck with Bulldawgs, Super D's, Suicks and spoons. Good Luck, Moose"
1217297,lightning rod,2010-07-08 16:20:00,15,"Moose, I think you gave me good advice last year before our trip to JointLake. We had an amazing time and the Hy-Vee hole produced walleye every time. We never did catch a trout but we did great on walleye in the 22"" to 28 range using crank baits.I am also from Iowa. We are trying to get into Aswap but for good reason most weeks are filled from year to year. So we thought maybe latter in the summer we would have a better chance of getting in.As I study the map it does seem like the East end is shallow, you can see weeds from the satellite photo. Unless someone tells me that's where I need to be, I think I will skip the long boat ride.The middle section seems to have two rivers coming in from the south and I am wondering if they would hold good fish.Does the river coming into the West end produce big fish?I have been following Trevor's reports and it sounds like it has been a good year so far. Good luck with your trip."
1217431,isumoose,2010-07-09 01:07:00,14,"Good to hear you got into the walleye at Joint last year. There are nice pike and trout in that lake also. Aswap has a decent walleye population with plenty in the 20-24 in range. The 28's eluded us but quite honestly because of the pike fishing we didn't fish for walleye near as much as we had at Joint. The pike fishing at Aswap is nothing short of phenomenal. I've been going to Canada regularly since '74 and our trip in 2008 there was the tops for pike. Our group of 4 each caught at least one 39+ pike every day. We ventured to the far east end one day and on our way back west we stopped where the Joint River dumps in for shore lunch. That spot and the whole north side of the middle section looked real promising and we fished it for a couple of hours after lunch but did raise any monsters. Because of the success we were having in the west end of the lake I just couldn't convince myself to get back over there the rest of the week. I going to try and spend at least one day over there this year I promise.The river flowing into the lake from the west is located about ¾ of a mile from the cabin. We didn't get much action there but just south of there extending almost to the south shore is a large weed flat. We spent time there every day and were not disappointed. On the north shore about 3 miles east of the river coming in the west end is a large bay. From here all the way along the north shore until it narrows always produced big pike. On the south shore the bay just west of the bay that the Bolton River dumps in also produced some trophies. The Bolton River bay got fairly shallow so we didn't spend a lot of time there. Since it was August we concentrated on the weed beds and rocky reefs that were near deeper water. Because of the success we were having we spent well over 75% of our time fishing these spots plus a couple of walleye holes for subsistence. Normally the first year our group is at a new lake we are much more adventurous. We've got a group of six this year so we plan on covering some more water.Are you guys planning a trip this August? If so, maybe we'll cross paths and can exchange information. One of our group has been very active on eBay and may have some near new Super D's for sale at the end of our trip to help fund his Brook Trout flyout. Good luck,Moose"
1217450,lightning rod,2010-07-09 06:36:00,15,"Thanks for the good advice. A new lake can be intimidating and having a few ideas to get started is comforting. If you saw the Bolton Lake add in the All Canada Show magazine this year, the guy in the picture with the walleye was from our group last year at Joint.We don't have a date booked this year but we are waiting to see if some of the guys get drawn for an elk tag. If they do not we are going to see if Trevor still has any opening for this year. Otherwise we are willing to take about any date we can get into Aswap next year.I have also thought about spending some extra money and doing the fly out to catch brook trout. It seems like if I've come that far why not experience that as well.On a personal note, can I assume from your login name you're an Iowa State fan? My wife and I have season football tickets and our son is on the ISU cheer squad. I just spoke with Paul Rhoads dad Cecil a few weeks ago while voting in the primary. We attended the same high school and played for the same high school football coach."
1217627,isumoose,2010-07-09 16:17:00,14,"You are correct, life long cyclone fan and season ticket holder. In fact our entire group this year minus one guy's high school son, all met at Iowa State back in the late '70's. Ah, the Earl Bruce era. It was a long cold spell for ISU football after graduation but things are definitely headed in the right direction again. We have the right man for the job in Rhoads.If we don't cross paths up north in August, look me up in Ames on game day. One of the other guys and I tailgate every game in the second tent north of Jack Trice. Just ask around for Moose."
