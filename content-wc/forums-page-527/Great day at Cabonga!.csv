Fished the Waskega Channel before Wa Wa pass and must have caught between 15 and 20 walleye. Kept 8 that were mostly between 2 and 4 lbs! Last night's storm really stirred things up, despite the low water and warm water. Posted pix on my fishing blog: http://eatsleepfish.blogspot.com/ Back to the Big Water tomorrow for more lakers!"

The guide Gary had told us fishing would pick up if they got a good rain storm to help stir up the waters. Where is Steve launching boats now? When I was up in June we had to go out past cabin 1. I can't see him staying open if the water continues to drop. Good luck with the rest of your trip."
1218814,eatsleepfish,2010-07-13 19:44:00,52,Boats are being launched out on the spit of sand beyond Cabin 1 but all boats are docked on the Indian Camp side of the Peninsula. Sue and Bruce are nice. Shared a lot G-2 with Bruce today. Something that I just learned today that DHL is changing hands August 1st. His cousin Sebastian is taking over. I met him and he is really nice but needs to work on his English otherwise we will be back to the Gailton Roubetelli days (guy who owned DHL before Steve's father bought it).
