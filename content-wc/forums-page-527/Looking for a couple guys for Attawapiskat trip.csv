1216522,pike hunter,2010-07-06 16:02:00,12,Our group of 6 just lost 2 guys for our trip to Beteau Lake 23-31 July. So we're looking for 2 guys to take their place. Kinda late notice but i figured I'd give it a shot. This is the lake that solopaddler wrote those incredible trip reports about. PM me and let me know if your interested. I'll hook you up with the outfitter and you can deal directly with him. Anyone?
1217701,pike hunter,2010-07-09 23:16:00,12,2 weeks to go. Anyone interested?
1217852,Mike Borger,2010-07-10 16:36:00,1554,"I'd love to go again myself, but I think I'd have to get the divorce papers signed first.Hope it works out for you."
1217857,Golden Eagle,2010-07-10 16:58:00,2642,"Solo, it will work. A few years ago I was fishing at Cobham River Outpost. On the last day I asked the pilot if he could drop me off at Little Vermilion Lake on the way back. He agreed, but said the camp was closed. Told the pilot to let the camp owner know I'd be there for a week and told my friends to call my wife to let her know I'd be a week late getting back home.That was the end of August and beginning of September. I made it back up in October. Also fished two weeks in May that year.We have 52 years of marriage in the books. Go for it."
1217887,Mike Borger,2010-07-10 20:14:00,1554,"Great minds think alike Connie, although these days I have to think twice.A few years back I was on a fly in canoe trip with a few friends.When the plane picked us up I had the pilot drop me in on my dad and his group who were staying at a nearby outpost.Totally spur of the moment. Neither my friends, my dad, or myself for that matter knew I was going to do that.Stayed another week in the bush then drove home with the old man.I miss those days.On the bright side we just came back from a week at place in QC and I'm headed into the Chapleau game preserve at the end of the month so things aren't all that bad."
1217916,adempsey,2010-07-10 23:25:00,963,Hope you find some replacements. I figure this place will be booked solid for the next few years so this is a great opportunity. If I had the money I'd be there.I mentioned this to a few of my buddies but they weren't able to do it.Best of luck.
1218421,pike hunter,2010-07-12 18:53:00,12,Thanks for spreading the word. We're still short so if anyone else knows someone who might be interested please let them know. thanks fellas.How did you guys spend an extra week in the wilderness with no planning? did you just eat fish? seems like we usually don't have much food left over at the end of the trip. definitely not enough for an extra week.
1218434,Golden Eagle,2010-07-12 19:25:00,2642,"Weather was good the first week so we didn't spend much time in the cabin eating all our food. We had a few things left over such as corn meal, dried beans, cereal, a little milk, a can of peaches, fish batter, half a loaf of bread, peanut butter, jam and a little more. I strain my peanut oil and can get two weeks from a gallon even when there are 6 people each week. ......................and my outfitter knows that he's welcome to anything in my cabin and we have no problem if I pick up an item or two from his cabin or pantry. We've had a long and enjoyable relationship beginning in 1972. I've flown into outpost camps in July and August when there'd be enough food to last a week. Somehow it piles up as the season goes along."
1218448,Mike Borger,2010-07-12 19:51:00,1554,"In my slightly younger days I've spent as much as 4 months travelling alone in the bush eating only fish, rice and oatmeal and drinking water.A week surviving on my dads leftovers was a walk in the park."
