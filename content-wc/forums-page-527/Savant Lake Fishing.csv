Over slot size Walleye and nice Lakers not to mention the Northerns. Cliff & Roma were exceptional host along with their son and daughter-in-law. For a great time try this camp! My 5th time there and getting better all the time.

Cliff & Roma and Trevor & Leslie (who will be taking over next year) are the absolute best hosts imaginable. The walleye fishing was unbelievably good - TONS of 22-25"" fish in addition to plentiful 15-16"" eaters. We didn't really fish pike at all until the last half-day, but picked up a couple of nice 36"" fish when we did. And the lake trout fishing was great as well. I'm looking forward to going back there again next year."
