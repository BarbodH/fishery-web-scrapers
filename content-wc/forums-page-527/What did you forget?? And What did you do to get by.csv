Not fishing related but we were going on a golf trip to Myrtle Beach several years ago..the limo picked us up at this one guys house..threw our luggage and golf bags in and headed to the airport..when we were checking our luggage this one guy whose house we left from actually forgot his golf clubs..he called his wife and she drove like a maniac to the airport and dropped off his clubs to him..he barely made the flight."
1218439,SinOrSwim,2010-07-12 19:34:00,1528,"I had a year a couple years ago that I forgot my pillow. I remembered it on the way up so we stopped at Walmart and I grabbed another one. Well, we sleep at the owners lodge/cabins the night before we fly out and I FORGOT MY PILLOW AGAIN! LOL Twice in a matter of two days. Ended up sleeping with these skanky pillows from the couch at the fly-in cabin. Good thing I had a ton of beer in me by the time I needed to sleep. I have everything down to the smallest item on an excel spreadsheet. Have a column of have, need, packed etc so I literally check stuff off. This way if I think of something I can add to the list and make sure I take it the next year. Oh, but I also had ""PILLOW"" on my list and still managed to screw that up twice in one trip."

1213604,northernbite,2010-06-26 04:49:00,1186,"Well I need to tell this story about a friend of mine that goes every year with our group in July. This was about 3 years ago in that hot dry july up in the Gogama area. As usual we arrived about 3pm at the lake, unloaded boats and headed down in to the lake where we set up a nice tent camp. As camp is coming together we here this man carrying on and I asked him what the matter? He said something and I said ""What""? I forgot my sleeping bag he said! Are you sure it's not up in truck? No it is home on my work bench. Well any other year I always brought an extra blanket but not that year because I had desided we hadn't needed it the last 18 years why would we need it now?The first night was that normal cool night, with all the sweet shirts, socks, pants and then the space blanket plus the ever present ""blue tarp"".I offered to take him to the truck so he could go buy one but not Mac, He is a little on the ""cheap"" side. Besides that would have been at least a 200 mile round trip. So to end this it turned out to be the warmest trip on record for us. 92 day and 70 at night.Morral of story, don't forget your sleeping bag.Paul"
1213649,Tonyo,2010-06-26 09:35:00,212,Last year on our trip north we arrived as planned and after dropping our boats in the water I realized that I had forgot to throw my 8' whip antenna in the boat. It was not a big deal but a convience to have with 4 boats and 12 guys in our group so we can stay in touch through out the day. Our camp owner never missed a beat. He went down to the local dealer in Red Lake and asked to borrow one for the week and by the time we were back at camp that night he was waiting with the antenna in hand. Problem solved.
1213653,Guest,2010-06-26 10:02:00,0,I forgot my whole tacklebox one year on a week flyin and the other guy brings nothing. Had a few spinner rigs and small lures in another place. Had enough bait though so we did fine. Came back a few rods lighter too as my buddy dropped his in the lake and then he broke one in a slammed door. Thats the way it goes.
1213658,jaggersr,2010-06-26 10:26:00,44,"About 6 or 7 years ago I took my 14 ft topper and gear for a ""boat in, camp on island"" trip to Ontario. It was a brand new lake that I had not fished before. The whole time I was driving through Michigan I kept thinking I was forgetting something. Nothing unusual for me, as I always feel that way on a trip up North. About 9:00 am my wife calls me on the cell and ask""why didn't you take your fish finder, its setting on the freezer in the garage"". I mutter a few choice words,but what you going to do. I knew the lake had depths from 8 to 60 feet but that was about it. I thought about turning back and finding a Canadian Tire and buying one but decided to go without. I fished ""old school"" for the week looking for points, shoals, and shoreline structure. Ended up being a great week as my buddy and I caught 40 to 50 walleye a day. Have never looked at my fish finders the same since."
1213693,elway12,2010-06-26 13:50:00,335,Last year our group got to the camp parking lot and were waiting to be picked up. I thought it would be nice to get some video of the all terrain vehicle they use to take us into the camp. We hear the rumbling of the engine coming down the trail so I get out my video camera and start shooting some great footage AND.....I didn't have any tape in the camera or a in any of my belongings so no footage of that or the nice 17 pound laker I reel in either
1213700,Crede,2010-06-26 14:21:00,134,"Got a set of Guidewear. Went on a flyin. Day #2 went thru everything and could only find the bibs. Spent the week in the Guidewear bibs/trash bag coat/hooded sweatshirt combo. Got back home, there was the coat sitting right where I had packed everything. Check list sitting beside it had ""raincoat"" neatly checked off. I have overcompensated since by taking both the Guidewear and a cheaper lightweight raincoat ""just in case""."
1213775,Rich B,2010-06-26 21:05:00,1081,"I also tend to ""over-pack"" as you never know if it's going to be in the 40s or 80s......sunny or raining ? My brother pulled his rig up to a northern Minn lake a few years ago and left his dash and front bow depth finders back home (11 hours away).....he normally pounds the shoreline, so no huge loss but he was upset as he likes to fish the 1st & 2nd breaks (not that week - ha) Have forgotten my caps/hats once in a while......thankfully they're available in most parts ! Rich B"
1213802,Pooch,2010-06-27 05:34:00,4619,"Reoccurring dream that we get to the lake and my rod tube is empty. I think this must be the fisherman's version of being in public in your undies.Very first fly-in and one guy forgot his sleeping bag so I gave him one of my two light blankets and we both froze all week.Later fly-in and another fellow forgot his entire clothes bag. After that trip the others always hide his duffel when we get to the lake.Every year there seems to be something. Even when working off of a list, something small or taken for granted seems to get overlooked. Usually there are others in the group that can help fill the gaps.We try to be a little bit minimalist on these trips, sometimes unknowingly.Pooch"
1213825,stinkycat,2010-06-27 08:01:00,2018,"I have been a ""list"" guy for as long as I can remember and have never forgot something important on a fishing/hunting trip except my memory I have forgotten tons of little things. I will tell you about a friend of mine that when we were still in high school and did a ton of duck and goose hunting in the Devils Lake ND area, he decided to tell us about half way between Grand Forks and Devils Lake that he had forgotten his shotgun. So we turned around and went back about 45 miles one way. Then, when we were at about the same spot, 45 minutes out, he informed us that he forgot his shotgun shells. We all gave him some of ours to get through the weekend. Now, same year but different local trip, we are just getting back to the car at dark with our limit of nice ducks and packed up all our gear and take off down the gravel road and I hear something bouncing off the top of the car. I ask him what that was and with a terrible look in his eye he said ""I forgot my shotgun on top of the car""! We backed up and found his gun which was still usable but pretty banged up. Sad part is the gun was only one year old. OK last story about this guy. We are taking off at dawn, going out rabbit and fox hunting in January. This guy leaned his, less than 4 month old, 243 Rem 700BDL against the truck right where the cab and the bed meet. Forgot it there and ran over it and broke the stock. He used it that winter with a little duck tape. Felt bad for the guy but I do not know if he ever grew out of it. Oh the memories!"
