A few years back we flew into Coles Lake and had a great time! The fishing was very good, the cabin was nice, and the boats were good. We had a problem with the refrigerator, called Mike,, and he was up there in hurry to fix it. You can't put a price on terrific service like that! We also stayed at their boat-in cabin on Slender Lake last fall and that was very nice. We liked it enough that we are going back this fall. By the way, I think they have the only cabin on all their lakes except Wabikimi and Smoothrock, which are both large lakes. Good luck and have fun. Dave"

1219258,dave macpherson,2010-07-15 05:04:00,7,"We didn't catch any huge fish at Coles Lake. The biggest walleye was about 24"" and the biggest northern about 30"". There was a huge mayfly hatch occurring, but I have never believed that those hatches affect fishing all that much. I did see a couple of huge walleyes swimming near the surface gobbling mayflies. We caught a lot of 17""-19"" walleyes. It was remote. We had access to a portage lake and a river. The river had brook trout. If you are looking for big walleyes, check out Smoothrock. Mike's honest, just ask him. Later, Dave"
