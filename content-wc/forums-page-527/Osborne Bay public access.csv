Near their put in dock, there is public access, but the road to the water is steep and had about 2 feet of soft sand....not even sure 4 wheel drive would handle it.Anyone know of any other public access on the southeast end of Eagle?The access I am talking about is off a road that goes over a bridge at the narrows where you would enter the Osborne Bay waters. Thanks a lot.Mike"

1217856,mms3rd,2010-07-10 16:55:00,148,"Do you know if it is manageable with 4 wheel drive...I got my two wheel Highlander stuck there and not pulling a boat....the problem was all the sand that the public folks dropped for a roadbed?I was just reading that there is access on Vermillion Bay, but there is really just too far away.P.S. I think this is the same road that takes you to the dock for South Shore Lodge.Thanks for help."

1218532,mms3rd,2010-07-13 07:11:00,148,thanks....seeing what I can see on Google earth....too bad it doesn't show the fish.....Mike
