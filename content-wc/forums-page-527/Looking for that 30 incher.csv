1208685,Fish_on,2010-06-09 17:58:00,1856,"If you are looking for a 30-incher you have to go where they are. On Lake Manitoba last week, my 15-year-old son showed how it is done. First fish 29.5, second 27, third 30.5. Piece of cake. PM me for more info if you really want to catch a 30+."
1217011,CowDoc75,2010-07-07 19:55:00,8,"Just got back on the 3rd of July. Trip was off the charts great, fishing was good. Still looking for a big one. Biggest walleye was 26 (newbie on a five of diamonds) with everyone catching a few over 20. Biggest Northern was 38.5 (Dad on a spinner rig and B. Bouncer) with several over 33. Numbers were down a bit this year at just over 30 fish per day per guy. Fished with 2 first time fisherman out of our group of 7(included in average). Weather was very inconsistent with a 50 degree swing in 36 hours and changing wind direction nearly every day. Fished one new lake for three of our six days with some growing pains but decent potential. Though about it a lot; wouldn't trade the trip I had for a boat load of big ones. Have to get them next time."
1217663,oldmanwalleye,2010-07-09 19:15:00,3,you need to come to tobin lake in saskatchewan!!!!!!30 inches is very common
1217664,oldmanwalleye,2010-07-09 19:17:00,3,tobin lake is very common for 30 plus walleyes
1207341,5 of Diamonds,2010-06-05 18:13:00,151,"CowDoc75:My bad. I agree w/ the others here. If you're regularly catching 50 Walleye per man/day, you're doing great! You mentioned the Kalin's plastic trailer w/ the saltwater jig. When I'm fishing I almost always have an 8"" Kalin's Evil Eel set-up. My set-up is as follows:8"" Kalin's Evil Eel on an Owner Bullet Type-Z Ultra Head 1/8 oz. or 3/16 oz. jig Texas rigged. I'll swim it as slow as I can to maintain the depth I want or I'll use a menacing, dead-slow, crawl right on the bottom. You can cut some of the body of the Eel down if you need too (you'll get a large # of tail bites). This rig is pretty durable. For this rig, I'm using either 10# or 12# flourocarbon.I would love to hear how your trip goes too when you get a chance. Best."
1207389,Obabikon,2010-06-05 21:18:00,2370,"Nothing wrong with that list, but it's very limited. Not many resorts reported their catches, and I would guess that there are less than 30 resorts that are competing for ""best catches""."
1207427,Pooch,2010-06-06 05:43:00,4619,"Ditto Obabikon's words. Most camps we fish do little advertising or promotion and most likely don't report larger fish. I've always figured that guys ""eyeballing"" fish in the boat have a strong tendency to over estimate the length of nicer fish. If I owned a camp I wouldn't put my reputation at risk by advertising something I couldn't verify.Even fish that we have put on a tape seem shorter when looking at pictures after the trip. They also seem much skinnier in a photo. Too bad that doesn't work like that for people pictures!I firmly believe that most all systems have ""big"" fish in them. With ""big"" being relative to the lake. Every much larger than average fish we have caught over the years have come from an area away from the ""eaters"". Almost always it's been a loner out in the middle of no-ware. And reflecting back, most have come unexpectedly in the middle of the day. That seems to go against most logical walleye thinking.Like I said in an earlier reply, don't give up. There are bigger fish some where in any given system, but they didn't get to be big fish by being dumb. I've wondered if sometimes they were caught when small and some how that imprinted upon them a wary nature. Maybe that's giving them too much credit.Have a good trip and if your putting those kind of numbers in the boat you are doing great. Just try moving away from the pack and settle for less fish, but more than likely they will run a little larger. Like the others have said consider looking deeper. Especially in the warmer months.Pooch"
1207439,Backwater Eddy,2010-06-06 06:21:00,3871,"Not sure what time of year your booking this trip, but you may consider looking to a late fall walleye bite...for a change? On average late fall is true big fish time, very often much better than pre-spawn. The weather can be more of a challenge, yet the average size will bump up dramatically if the system is capable of large trophy fish. Maybe...shift the trip, try the late bite? River ststems often host the best big walleye bite in the fall too, so some homework on what oppertunitys are regionally avalable may pay off big for you."
1207522,Jigger1,2010-06-06 11:33:00,234,"I'm still looking for my 30 too, but believe I'm going to the right place. I'll be at SWWL on Wednesday for my 11th year. My group (which has ranged from 2 - 10 people, 3 this year) over the last 10 years has caught 34 walleyes over 28"" under the guidance of SWWL. This includes 11 over 29, two of which were 30.5 & 31. Hope everyone has a great trip this season!"
1207561,Obabikon,2010-06-06 15:31:00,2370,"One of our guests caught the first 30"" of the year this weekend."
1207673,Lonefisherman,2010-06-06 22:40:00,13,"Hey Guy, You might have to do some homework. If you are looking for big Walleyes you will have to fish waters that hold big Walleyes and fish them when they are biting. Most lakes have their share of large Walleyes but they may not be a fishable population to show up for anglers. As probably a rule of thumb most big Walleyes will show up when the water is cooler to cold. But don't rule out fishing deeper for huge Walleyes during the summer. Hope things work out for you in your quest to find that ellusive huge Walleye."
1208357,Justin Syder,2010-06-08 21:34:00,6,We just returned from a 4 day Fly in with Hidden Bay Lodge in Sioux Lookout.We flew into Blackstone lake where we had excellent fishing. We caught two 31' and a 32' Walleye and a 46' Northern. Minnows and plastic is all we used. Minnows worked the best for us.We found a great discounted trip on the Hidden Bay Lodge website. 30% off. Great outfit. We'll be back!!!! Highly recommended!!Justin
1208371,adempsey,2010-06-08 22:57:00,963,"I am sure you will eventually catch a 30""+ fish in one of those smaller lakes, but it won't be as common as places like Lake Erie and Ontario. If you ask anyone where to go for big walleye in Ontario, they will say Bay of Quinte (off of Lake Ontario). Consistently big fish there, especially late summer/fall.One other bit of info that I follow is if you're catching fish that are <24"" you will not likely catch the bigger ones. Why? They aren't there. It has been suggested that fish school within their year classes, so the 24""+ fish likely hang around together and not with the smaller fish. I have experienced this myself catching several 26""+ fish within 20 minutes from the same small area. So, if you find a spot with 24""+ fish, go back there at prime walleye times and hopefully you'll land an even bigger one."
1208450,northernbite,2010-06-09 07:35:00,1186,"Well I've been going up above Savant for 7 years and north of Sudbury 20+, I've caught, maybe 10 walleye between 27 and 29 3/4. No 30 inchers. Spoons and 3-way harnesses have worked for me. Everyone was on a hidden hump off of deep water that most people don't fish. Each one of these humps I've found by watching my graph running up and down lake. I've also fished these humps every year since they we found them and have not caught any big ones since. This may sound odd but it seems I catch the big ones when it's hot and calm. We also turn them back after pictures.Enjoy your tripFrom an old cow farmer from Pennsylvania; Paul"
1207175,CowDoc75,2010-06-05 05:49:00,8,"Fourth trip in 8 years to the Savant Lake, Ontario area and our group has never caught a walleye over 26 inches (usually 6 or 7 guys with moderate to limited fishing abilities, farm boys from WI with a fishing problem). We fish at the drive in lakes near Savant like Harris, Poshkagogan?, Wintering and others and we seem to do well numbers wise but never size wise. We usually jig, throw rapallas, and last time we trolled spinner rigs behind BB's with some success. With the right weather we can usually get 50 or so walleyes a day per guy, sometimes better or worse but NEVER a big one. We usually fish mid June but can't leave until the 25th this year. We put our time in, fishing light to light but never after dusk. Do I need to try a new area (we love it here)? A new style? Fish at night? Different time of year? Go on a fly-in? Sell the boat and Avids and take up golf?"
1207195,PIKEMAN330,2010-06-05 07:41:00,101,I have never had much luck catching larger fish at fly-in lakes.Numbers yes but not size.My largest fish have been caught trolling large baits.Baits like #18 rapalas and large spoons. Good fishing Pikeman

1207223,Freytown,2010-06-05 08:57:00,770,"On Northern waters a 30Â” walleye is a very old & a well fed fish. I doubt that very many exist up North with the exception of the Great Lake waterways.If you're catching 50 fish per day per man, with 26 inchers in the mix I'd say you are doing better than most guys on drive in lakes without a catch & release policy. I would say your fishing abilities are just fine."
1207224,5 of Diamonds,2010-06-05 08:57:00,151,"90% of my trips are fly-in and we catch our fair share of large walleye (30"", 10#). Anyhow, 3 tips that for the most part have worked somewhat consistently for us:1) Don't leave fish to find fish.2) Use larger soft plastic baits (like Gary Yamamoto & Kalin's) when jigging.3) Work deeper water than what you would traditionally fish when jigging.5"" & 6"" Hula grubs (Yamamoto) & Mogambo's (Kalin). We're usually using @ least a 1/4 oz jig but mostly 3/8 oz especially in any kind of current. Good Fishing!"

Click on a year and you can search by species. It can give you some ideas of where to look. Good luck - Stu"
1207234,fishman10,2010-06-05 09:43:00,226,"it sounds like you have been doing very well. i fish northern canadian lakes exclusively and 30 inch plus walleye do not come easy. i would also agree that deeper water is a better bet, larger baits will produce bigger fish and jumbo leeches do produce big walleye. it sounds like you are not doing anything wrong, the big ones will eventually come."
1207244,JinxCanada,2010-06-05 10:11:00,1306,if you want MONSTER walleye...you NEED to come to the Windsor area...go fish in Colchester lake Erie and you will find TONS AND TONS of 30+ Walleye...i have seen 14 lbs walleye come up often. We have the Walleye Derby coming up on June 12th!!! come join us! you can register right at the dock the day of the tourney
1207247,Reels,2010-06-05 10:17:00,2876,"Best advice I can give is fish water that has a reputation for big fish. Silver Water Wheel lodge has some great articles on their website about catching large fish and selecting the right body of water. (I have never been there, but agree with the article.) Slide a little deeper if you are in a school of smaller fish and sometimes you will find bigger ones. Maybe it is just me, but most of my big fish come on something pink fishing Canadian waters during low light conditions. http://www.sww-lodge.com/fishingstories.php#bigfish"
1207265,CowDoc75,2010-06-05 11:34:00,8,"Just glad nobody has told me to pick up golf, life is too short to spend time on that so called game. Went up last fall on a bear/fishing trip with my Dad and had some big Kalin plastic trailers along but was trying them on owner saltwater jigs for pike. Do you vertical jig with that size of plastic or fish it more like a swimbait? We may be fishing to shallow for the big ones. Seems like our best luck numbers wise is windswept shorelines that go from 20ish feet and then hard break up to 10 to 6 feet with weed edges. We usually jig the tops of the ""ledge"" and don't concentrate much on the bottom of the break. Going a little later and with the early spring will that change things even more (meaning go even deeper)? You guys have been a big help, thanks much and hope your generosity is rewarded with your own 30inchers."
