1217581,cnydave,2010-07-09 12:56:00,33,"Rab...You are correct , the out flow into Barrier lake is part of the headwaters of the Ottawa River. I have fished this area when the dam is on and can attest that the fishing is much better when it is on, I just returned from a trip to DHL and the fishing sucked to say the least. Last several trips to Deer Horn have been a disappointment. The fishing has definitly gone down hill in the last couple yrs. I myself am looking at different facilities for the futhur. I strongly believe you will have to travel farthur north for better fishing.Steve Hamil the owner does a fine job of operating the lodge , but has no control over water levels which have a direct impact on the fishery.Thanks , CNY DAVE."
1217892,eatsleepfish,2010-07-10 20:32:00,52,"In 1999 it was low but not this low (I think). I am blogging this trip, check my posts: http://eatsleepfish.blogspot.com/"
1218809,Guest,2010-07-13 19:35:00,0,"Our group has been going to DHL for about 20 years. We had heard rumors that work would be taking place on one or more of the dams around Cabonga, most notably Barrie Dam (the one nearest Deer Horn). I have looked all over the net but I can't find any info from Hydro Quebec or the River Authority about any projects happening there. Anyone have any info or links? We have had pretty good luck in the past years. I would agree that water level is the biggest factor on the fish count. Looking Eatsleep's pics of areas I recognize, I can say I have never seen the water as low as it looks in the pictures. Its a little hard to tell but the old tressel at Waskega might be impassable. Did you try it when you were there Eatsleep?"
1218822,eatsleepfish,2010-07-13 20:11:00,52,"Water level is down almost 6 feet. Apparently Ottawa needs the water to drink and cool themselves off by generating power. Question is, how long will it take the Cabonga to fill back up? Could take years, especially if they have more crappy winters and springs. Apparently there was no snow and very, very little rain this spring. Fished Waskega Channel today but and looked at Wa Wa Pass (old trestle) but didn't try it. I don't think my 92"" beam would fit! Caught Walleyes up and down the channel though. One bit of info for you. This is Steve's last year. He is selling the place to his cousin, Sebastian. I have met him and he is nice but doesn't speed much English."
1218884,cep56,2010-07-14 04:14:00,17,"Sharpfish, I too have searched the web for information regarding the projects with no luck. Last year the Barrier dam upgrade was completed so the level dropping is not for Barrier dam work. This was the only explanation we had. When our group was at DHL 7/3-7/6, we spoke with the guide who told us they needed to repair the hydro dam. Therefore, they had to lower the Baskatong and the Cabonga. As far as the Barrier spillway being open, I'm not sure if it's for the Ottawa river usage or just to get more water out for repairs. The guide also told us it definately would be years refilling.The next couple years will be interesting especially with Steve's departure and water levels.cp."
1219186,eatsleepfish,2010-07-14 18:25:00,52,"Spoke to Steve today and he said the lowest it has ever been was 11 feet in 2000. We are down about 7 feet right now and it's probably going to keep going down for another week or two, at least that is what they are saying around here. It's dropping about 2 to 3 inches a day. Steve thinks it could be three years before the water level is back to normal. Just made through the old waterfall/rapids section on the route to Sterns Pass. Took 2 hours to get down there because when ever it shallows to 10 feet we slow down incase there is a rock that we don't know about. That happened to us on the first day. We hit a rock on the way down but going slow and on the way back hit one going fast. We'll be replacing the propeller this fall but it's working fine right now. Limited on Lakers today! Steve said to fish the east side of the big water, which we did and got some small ones. Then we were on the opposite side and marking fish between 100 and 150 feet. Put our lures down at 100 feet and caught some nicer ones."
1214396,Guest,2010-06-29 03:55:00,0,"We saw a healthy looking black bear on our logging road entry to deerhorn this year. He paused just off the road to give us a look and then was gone. We were surprized that we were able to drive to our cabin on a sand beach that last year had been under a couple of feet of water. Unfortunately it also meant that the good fishing that we had in shallow water was not there this year. We altered our tactics and caught fish on deeper running lures and jigs Our numbers for the week were down from previous years but we enjoyed two walleye feasts while we were there and all four of us had limits to take home. Our run for lake trout was a success and we caught a limit of smaller fish in the 20 to 25 inch class. Small but delicious. As usual we were treated to the beauty of the area, seeing numerous eagles, a family of otters, many gatherings of loons (the birds....not refering to our group). When loons gather in these groups they become very vocal, sounding like a group of children playing when heard from a distance. Two sauger were caught. Very reddish in color and blochy markings compared to the golden color on walleye. We litterally marked thousands of good looking walleye symbols on our fishfinders, and although they were not as willing to hit as in the past......there will be another time. Good fishing to all."
1214437,cnydave,2010-06-29 07:51:00,33,"Rab....Thanks for the info. on Cabonga , we are heading up for 3 days this coming Sat. July 3rd. Any comments on where you did best for walleye.I have heard comments that the fishing in Wagoose bay is non exzistent. Did you try Barrier Lake at all , i have had good luch there. Best if the water is flowing. Is it a long run from deer horn to the area where you fished the lakers ?"
1214460,Guest,2010-06-29 09:13:00,0,"CYNdave, Wagoose was productive with a wind blowing into it. Jigging and letting the wind move you accross the points in about 15 ft of water. In the channel leading to wagoose and andou, where you make a right turn into wagoose or a little further where you turn left into andou in 6 to 9 ft of water, good eater size fish. Fog island area, far shore, top of burns bay was the most talked about and fished. Bottom of burns bay just before entering the shallow area leading to Mike and Patrick was dense with fish and bait. Be careful of the rocks. Many more have grown since the lake level went down. The lake trout run is a long one. Through Cox bay and a winding way from there. First time we went we hired Gary, one of the lodge guides. After that my ""photographic"" fishing memory took over. We have never fished Barriere lake proper, only the area where it turns into the ottawa river at its outflow. Good luck, the fishing will probably turn on, and there have been some large walleye caught."
1214708,still fishin',2010-06-29 21:59:00,69,"RAB,We fished alot of the same areas last week. We never found any one spot where we caught alot of fish. There were 10 in our group with 4 boats. We had to cover alot of water to catch 2 or 3 fish here and there. We also caught 4 saugers (1st time ever for us at Cabonga.) Wagoose was slow for us but andou produced a few (trolling). That may have been your group catching a couple off the point at wagoose while we were beached (we beached just in time to feel the earthquake). Although the fishing was slow, we did eat fish 4 times and each guy brought home 4 fish (we skinned too many one evening) The number of 20+ inch fish was incredible considering how few fish we boated. Can't reccommend any one spot but the lesson we learned was to keep moving. Early in the week we would try to hammer one spot for hours with little success. Most of our fish were found/caught trolling. Hope the water level holds up. We were told that it dropped 15"" in 1 week."
1215772,emanonmac,2010-07-03 22:45:00,62,"According to Steve's website for Deer Horn Lodge, the water level is down 5 feet and still dropping. Some area's are not accessable."
1216489,eatsleepfish,2010-07-06 14:11:00,52,My Dad and I are headed up there on Friday. This could be the lowest the Reservoir has been since we started going to DHL in 1981 (not consecutively mind you) and we have seen some low years. I think there was one year where they were launching boats out past Cabin 1. Looking at an old photo album I have pictures of WaWa pass (entrance to Rock Lake from the Waskega Channel) where it's atleast 3 to 4 feet below a rock pile that was used to support the old bridge through there. That was the same year we found the skidoo in Whitefish lake. The main boat docks that year were south of the dining hall. I think that was in 1999. Of course now that we go after lakers it's going to suck if we can't get through to Stern's pass.
1216656,Guest,2010-07-07 03:48:00,0,"Eatsleepfish, they were launching boats beyond cabin one when our group was there several weeks ago. The present lake level will be a challenge. Steve's take on it will probably be that the fish will be more concentrated. So will the baitfish and any other forage. It could turn into a great bite, or the fish could be so off pattern that it could go the other way. Please give a report when you get back. Our group experienced a few years of poor fishing after a similar draw down years ago. Cabonga had come back tremendously in the past few years. We keep going because we don't care to drive more than thirteen hours, we now have a good knowledge of the lake, and we've had all the walleyes we could want. I'm afraid that is about to change and we might be looking for other options. Good luck on your trip."
1216827,cep56,2010-07-07 12:19:00,17,"We returned yesterday from a four day trip to Deer Horn. The level is still going down. Spoke with the guide regarding the bite, he stated since the earthquake, the fish have shut off, day / night / chop / rain it doesn't matter. One boat in our group fished Barrier the first afternoon and returned with 13 eater walleye, while the other two boats picked up only a couple fishing Cabonga.The fish cleaning station waste pails were mostly empty during our stay. and with the weather in the mid 80's, bright sunshine and no wind we didn't do well the rest of the trip.All boats in our group marked loads of fish and put anything and everything we had in front of them with not much luck. We fished from 7-mile bay to the tressle. One positive note for the people going to deer Horn this week, the dam at Barrier was being turned on as we drove by on the way out. This should improve the fishing on both sides of it.Good Luck..."
1217148,eatsleepfish,2010-07-08 07:37:00,52,"I translated this off of the DHL website: Barrier Dam opened since July 6 walleye fishing is to become suddenly very good and if you want to catch a sturgeon is the time! So, I guess this means water is now flowing into the Cabonga? Anyone else going to Cabonga the week of July 10th through the 17th?"
1217529,Guest,2010-07-09 09:32:00,0,"Eatsleepfish, I believe Cabonga is the higher lake in the area so the water would be flowing into Barriere lake into the Ottawa system, through other reserve lakes to feed the power generating dams on the lower Ottawa. The main dam on Cabonga feeds the Gatineau river which was the lowest I've ever seen it. That water ends up in the Ottawa but below most of the power dams. I've never been at Deerhorn when the Barriere dam was discharging but that seems to be the time to fish there. I hope that the rains start coming for the sake of the fishery and the Lodge. Draining the shallow weedy, stumpy areas in my opinion will negatively effect the fishing for years to come. We've had good pike fishing in past years in those areas (5 to 15 pounds) and on the rare occasion that I have fileted a pike, usually a 28 incher, they have had several large crayfish in their stomachs. That forage base will not come back quickly. Let us know how you find the fishing when you return.......Good Luck."
