Stay near the cane and lettuce weeds for them.Back to the walleye. A slow drift with a crawler harness would be a good idea. Start in 20-30 foot and drift up to the 10foot area's in the muddy bay's (Coreshack and 61).If you try the rocks around the islands you can take advantage of your electronics and vertical jig.The key to this lake is slow presentation. Have a great time."
