We had to use the electric in one section and thought we were in the clear but hit a rock on the way to Sterns. In the big water I picked a small laker but threw him back. 2 hours later I got an 8 lb laker on 10 lb test and a light casting rod. We were trolling in 125 feet of water and I was 100' down. He ran a few times and took so much line that I almost ran out of lane. Later, on the way back we stopped to jig in a 20' channel when I caught the 7 lb walleye on a jig!"
