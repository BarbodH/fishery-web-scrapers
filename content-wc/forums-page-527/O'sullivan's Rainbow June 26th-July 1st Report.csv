We will be renting boat, so it might be tough without a troling motor or a good anchor. I'm also going to try top water baits for pike, when we get bored catching walleye. I'll post our results when I return. Have a great Summer!"

This trip had it all fish, food and hospitality. First fish the three of us caught 629 walleyes . Although my brother in the rental boat would fish awhile and then go exporing you were never sure where him and his long lens camera would show up. The weather was wild we had warm dry days and very windy rainy cold days. The wter temp dropped from 73 when we arrived to 63 the the last afternoon we fished. We found fish in 10-20ft with our bbounce harnesses (Northland Spinn and Float chartreuse] then pulled numbers with jigs with either crawler or minnows no curly tails a first for me really basically all under the boat sometimes snap jigging sometimes slight lifts. Very few caught casting they moved around the flats and repositioning was required the MinnKotta Terrova I-Pilot worked awesome in the anchor lock postion. Our big Walleyes were a 291/4"" and a 28"" both came on bouncers. There were many times that we had a hard time filling the slots with eaters. [only 1 over 18""]. For a camp north of the 50 the size of these Walleyes are outstanding enough said. The food, my brother Nathan a master chef created was enough to feed small countrys. Cobblers baked apples and french toast and steaks the list could go on and fish almost every night too. Hospitality Bob and Shelley are the best hosts I have come across fishing north of the border. Their place is very well maintained clean and everything is easily reached the bath and showers work flawlessly as well as kitchen appliances in the cabin Bob and Shelley seem to have an energy about them that says they are doing exactly what they were meant to do and liking it! Sign me up for next year and the ten after that. For pics my fishing blog is http://walleyewarrior.blogspot.com/"

1217234,Mr Ranger,2010-07-08 12:39:00,272,"Hey Bill, rumor has it Darryl was feeding the walleye some of that French Toast. By next week that 29 1/4 could be a 31 Travel safe and will be watching the weather while your up."

1217377,515,2010-07-08 20:02:00,254,Thanks for the report and great job on the picture show. I'll be flying over the lake in just over a week on our way to our little holiday. Can't wait.
1217417,Putzer5,2010-07-08 21:47:00,11,"Great report Darryl! We will be going to O'Sullivan's the week after Bill. We have been going there for fifteen years and the fishing gets better every year. I agree.. Bob and Shelly are great hosts! We mainly fish with bottom bouncers and crawler harnesses, but I'd be interested in the type, size, and color of the jigs, that you were using. I'd like to give it a try. Also, did you get a chance to fish Superb, and was it worth the trip?Bill, If you get this before you leave... GOOD LUCK! We will be leaving from Detroit , on 7/23. I'm driving up from Tennessee on 7/21. hopefully you can share some information with me when you return. Have a great trip and save some for me"
1217422,Erie Ranger620,2010-07-08 22:40:00,74,"Never got to Superd weather was rough most of the time will get there in years to come though. The water was about 3 ft low so extra caution is a must and uncharted water means even more caution. Also jugs are difficult to see in white-caps. A good way to find a nice spot to jig is if you pick a fish every time go through a spot with the bb harness I look for doubles as a really good sign drop a marker bouy, anchor near it using the lightest jig possible 1/4oz a good over all pick. experiment with white or chartrous 3 in curly tails tipped with a small piece of crawler or minnow or just a piece of crawler or minnow with no curly tail drop it straight over the side to the bottom pick it up about 6in give it snap up about a 1ft let it fall free many times they hit it on the fall if that doesnt work give it acouple of slow subtle lifts and falls if that doesnt work let it just sit there letting the action of the boat give it small movements. I generally give it about ten minutes then keep working the bouncer into new areas seeking more agressive fish if you find them with a jig they will generally stay there until a wind or weather change occurs although they will peak in agressive from time to time. Fireline will help you detect light bites and a lite action rod helps too. one oy my favorite jig methods is to thread the hook through the crawler about an inch and leave an inch dangle much like a curly tail. Often a minnow will bring a more aggressive bite but I hate rebaiting minnows on a finnicky bite. snap jigging a minnow on an aggressive pod of fish is soooo much fun when you snap it and a fish has aready sucked in the bait on the fall you both will be surprised. I do love the bbouncer pulled with the electric motor over flats this year it was a combo of them creaming it on occasion and just a weight that devopled that you would miss and then it would come back miss it again until finnally they would commit, often as soon as the miss occured I just free spooled for a couple seconds and that would help. These fish are the strongest eyes I have ever come across they don't stop fighting. my hands were very beat up the all day rain didnt help that. I hope your trip goes well"
1217482,Guest,2010-07-09 07:58:00,0,I have been following alot of the O'Sullivan lake threads for the past couple of years. My wife wants to celebrate our anniversary (camping) and was wondering if there are any sandy beaches AWAY from the crowds with a suitable area for a large tent (12x20). Any info would be greatly appreciated. Don't want to drive 14 hours from Southern Ontario to find out there's no where to set up camp for the week. Thanks Jason

1217682,Putzer5,2010-07-09 21:02:00,11,"O'Sullivan's Rainbow has a camping area, but no sand beach. Thy do have a very nice sun deck where the boats are docked. There are a very few sand beaches around the lake, but only if the water is low."
