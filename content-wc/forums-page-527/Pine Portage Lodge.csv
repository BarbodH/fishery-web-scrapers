1211992,Kruger,2010-06-21 08:29:00,259,"2 years ago we were there the first week of July. It was the first time I had ever fished walleye during the mayfly hatch. I had always heard it made it really tough. We had the best week ever up there. Over 100 fish everyday. Since then I have read where people say to fish a jig with a piece of nightcrawler during the hatch. That is how we fish 90% of the time when there, I guess we were doing the right thing without knowing it. We will be going the 3rd week of July this year. So please post a report after you get back."
1215575,adempsey,2010-07-02 23:48:00,963,"Just got back from Kaby Lake. Water is down about 3 feet according to the camp owners (first time I have been to this lake). Fishing was good for us, but not spectacular. Our best day we probably landed 50-60 fish between the three of us. None of us knew the lake well and we just explored around trying various spots (at the South end). Three of our days were quite windy as well so we just fished closer to the lodge.There were no bugs when we were there. It got fairly cold a couple of the days too. I saw some mayfly nymph casings on the water surface occasionally, but I think the hatch was finished.Others at the camp that have been going for 10+ years said the fishing was good but the locations with fish were always different. Most of these guys trolled all day.Hope you have a good trip! Already missing it.Cheers."
1217526,Kruger,2010-07-09 09:24:00,259,"Did you troll at all to find active fish? My first few years I would troll Islands and points to find fish, then jig. I would still do that if it wasn't for the other guys I go with don't like to troll. Now we just go to the same 5 or 6 spots that always seem to have fish. Did you do any Pike fishing? One of the guys in our group would only fish pike if we let him. When I tell him I read your report he will ask about pike and if the weed beds are to the top of the water yet."
1217819,adempsey,2010-07-10 12:00:00,963,"We did some trolling (along island points, shorelines, rock piles, weed bed edges, sand bars) with cranks and bottom bouncers with harness/slow death and crawlers. Some days it was too windy to bother so we drifted instead (with jigs, worms or tossing out cranks). My father also isn't fond of trolling, so we only trolled when the drift wasn't producing (and not the most fun with three in a small boat).I'd recommend the trolling/jigging strategy you mentioned. So much lake to search and the fish seemed to move around a lot from my limited experience. Your buddy can even toss cranks along the shoreline while you troll if they don't like trolling.Three of the days we didn't venture out too far due to the wind so we visited several spots that produced for us previous days (Sand bar where 3 fow dropped to 5 fow was great one day and a little deeper from that (6-7 fow) other days; weed beds for pike and walleye; beaver lodge for pike; rock piles for pike/walleye). I was told there were a lot more weeds than usual since the water is 2-3' lower than average. I came across many really thick weed beds and some that were more sparse. Reeds (?, not sure what type of plant it is actually - look like small reeds) are all over the shoreline. There will be no lack of ideal places to fish for pike. We pretty much caught some fish everywhere. We did fish for pike. Pike were primarily in the weeds. Weeds were either ""reeds"" in 3 fow and we fished the outside edge, or submerged weed beds in 5-8 fow. There was a lot of weed and you can see them touching the water surface. The pike went for everything (not surprising). I was using Johnson's Silver Minnow with a grub trailer, Red Eye wabbler, Williams spoon and flies. My father and brother caught them on various small cranks, jigs and worms as well. All were small and only had a larger one follow.For whatever reason, SILVER lures worked amazingly well for both pike and walleye. I tried other colors, and they worked, but it appeared that anything polished silver out fished the rest. I was surprised since I was under the impression that gold was the color of choice in this lake. Maybe it was just dumb luck. The walleye also preferred the chub style baits over the longer profile baits (something I also read previously). So Storm Thin Fins, Hot'n'Tots and Rapala Shad Raps worked great on walleye and pike. We caught many fish trolling and tossing cranks, it was a lot of fun.Hope you have a good trip!"
