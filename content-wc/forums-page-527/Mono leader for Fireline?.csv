I fished Rainy River in April and others had a mono liter and I didn't, but it didn't matter. I have been in a boat though where maybe that was the difference."
1218859,SinOrSwim,2010-07-13 21:42:00,1528,I use whatever the snoopy pole comes with. Thinking of going with a Spiderman pole this year though.
1218050,MorganMan,2010-07-11 14:47:00,341,"I like to fish walleyes and get to Canada for a fly-in once a year for the past 17 years then a few other shorter and closer trips here and there. I have been using Fireline for a few year now as I seem to be able to get a better feel whether I'm jigging or pulling spinners. Some of the guys I fish with use monofilament only or will use a monofilament leader if using Fireline or Spiderwire. What is the value of the monofilament leader? It seems to me more knots means more chance at losing a nice fish? Is it a sight thing for the fish? Any info would be appreciated as far as pros and cons if there are any. Also, how do you tie an inline knot like that?"
1218053,guidedfishing,2010-07-11 15:03:00,531,"MM, When I use a leader on Power-Pro or Fireline for walleye, I will tie a small swivel on and then add approx 2ft of floro-carbon. Most times it does not make a difference. This year it did. I happen to be using a leader with power-pro, my son was fishing a jig directly to fireline. I was catching fish, he was not, same jig same presentation. I suggested giving a leader a try. Bang he started catching fish. good luck GF"
1218063,Mich_Fisherman,2010-07-11 15:36:00,292,"Depends where I am fishing.... if it is northern Canada, the Fireline goes right to the jig. If I am jigging in a fast moving river with lots of snags like the Detroit river I will use ~24"" of 6# Vanish with a barrel swivel. Mainly for snags...it will be the weakest link and will break at the Vanish. The barrel swivel should also stop the jig from spinning and twisting the line. On our fly in trips into northern Ontario it doesn't seem to matter to the fish, but has Guide has pointed out...sometimes it does."
1218069,locomoto,2010-07-11 15:54:00,1131,I tie a mono leader on my Power Pro mainly when ice fishing. I use a Uni to Uni knot and have had no problems with knot failure. The Uni to Uni knot is pretty low profile as well. Good Luck
1218075,leogunner,2010-07-11 16:32:00,18,I'm the same as most of you. Mono leader to Power-pro. Eyes can be pretty finiky sometimes
1218083,MorganMan,2010-07-11 16:48:00,341,"I have never used PowerPro line, what advantages does it have over Fireline?"
1218099,greenie,2010-07-11 17:48:00,87,"I use small swivel and 2ft leader too when jig fishing. We like to fish the rocks so tying a swivel on with leader only makes sense. If lose the jig and a little of the leader, so what. At least I'm not breaking my rod with the fireline or have to cut 20 ft. chunks off of fireline every snag I get."
1218104,leogunner,2010-07-11 18:30:00,18,Personal preference really
1218816,MorganMan,2010-07-13 19:51:00,341,Thanks for the info fellas. I will likely pick up some Power Pro line for our trip next month. I will likely wait on the mono leader til fishing closer to home with more finnicky (?) fish.
1218843,Hawkfan,2010-07-13 21:08:00,237,What about spinner rigs? Prefer mono there as well?
