No monsters, but at the camp here we had mostly musky guys. The Musky fishing was good. Walleyes are kind of all over the place... some shore lines, some reefs, some rock points. 8-16ft of water."

Jigs/leeches was more productive then minnows, didn't have any crawlers but I'm thinking they would hit them too just because of the numbers of fish being caught....many triple headers. Any bright colored jig works but it seemed like the chartreuse/orange was the best. Very little jigging action is needed, the best was just holding jig in one place and let the leeches do their thing. We didn't fish very long, maybe 2 hours before it started to pour but I'm thinking almost any hump should be hitting......just keep jumping hump to hump till you find the big gurlz."
