1218956,phishfearme,2010-07-14 08:03:00,1242,"We just returned from a 10 day trip to the Pickle Lake area using North of 51 Outfitters where the 6 of us fished at both their Bow and Otoskwin Lakes fly-in outpost cabins. The Otoskwin Lake cabin is for 2 people so we had the outfitter swap 2 guys out after 5 days there - difficult logistics but this enabled 4 of us to experience two lakes/cabins during the same trip for an additional $150 for the swap flights. Weather was good in general (MUCH MUCH better than last year) with periodic rain storms but comfortable temps. One of our main objectives was to portage upstream on the Otoskwin River from Otoskwin Lake to fish a No-Name Lake where the outfitter had placed a boat for us to use. We had to lug a heavy 9.9hp motor over a 100 meter portage to complete the setup. A couple of trips up to No Name produced mixed results as this lake which is much more of a widening in the river than a lake. The guys did find a few places where ""fishing was as it used to be"" including a number of 23-24inchers  but the extremely fast action we had hoped for didn't materialize. Fishing at Bow Lake: Was pretty much as usual (this was our 4th trip to that lake) with the various rock piles and islands producing good catches of larger than average walleye. We all caught walleye in the 23-24inch range and we stopped counting the 19-21inchers  just too many. Pike were small but numerous  as I've stated in previous reports, this should not be considered a pike lake  just darn good walleye. The outfitter also flew a canoe in for us which we placed at the very outlet of this 15 mile lake to fish below the outlet rapids  we did two of these trips and caught a good number of fish. We also portaged above the main inlet rapids where the outfitter has another boat and motor and did three trips there with good results  but not great because the river level was quite high and getting higher after a huge rain storm we had early in the trip. Fishing at Otoskwin Lake: This was our first trip to this lake so we got some valuable info from the group that was there the weeks earlier than us. The outlet flowage proved to be the best producer with a number of other spots also producing nice catches. The guys didn't get anything really large from Otoskwin but had good numbers. We saw quite a few moose including a nice size bull in the Williams River above Otoskwin Lake and also one swimming in the water at Bow with a huge swarm of horse flies (moose flies?) that also attacked us. We also had a bear in camp which had to be dispatched. A special wildlife experience was a family of pine martins observed during a portage above Bow Lake. All in all a wonderful trip and the outfitter did all they could to keep us happy  including providing ice and water. Would highly recommend North of 51. Questions? Feel free to ask. phish"

1219200,phishfearme,2010-07-14 19:12:00,1242,mike - i think we'd do otoskwin lake again but only for a 3-4 day trip - it's abit small and the best spots on no-name were just above the portage so there's no real need to travel far on no name. this was our 4th 10 day trip to bow lake - the facilities and fishing - and it being a 6 minute flight from pickle lake - make it a deal too good to pass up. but wettlaufer lake - which we re-opened for dwight and karen - provided the best fishing of all - and we've been doing flyins for almost 20 years now. you can find my reports on wettlaufer by searching this board. thanks for the post. phish
