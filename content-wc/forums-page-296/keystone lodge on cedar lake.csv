3488642,Gone,2015-01-28 16:05:00,9,What about Cedar Lake Lodge? We are booked there the week of June 13 -19
3489026,1jigfish2,2015-01-28 18:18:00,110,"Gone, Cedar Lake Lodge is fine, you will like it. Al and Kim are good hosts.It is on an island about halfway down the west arm. It has lots of great fishing nearby, you will not have to go far, unless you want to explore. He will point out good spots for you."
3489098,Gone,2015-01-28 18:38:00,9,Where can I go to find out all I need to know about Cedar and how to fish it? I want to make sure I have the right tackle and anything else I need to know about the trip. I appreciate your response.
3489218,Glenman12,2015-01-28 19:03:00,762,"what did Al try to push you to buy...Ive been going there since hes owned it, and longer and hes never tried to puxh anything on us.."
3489586,1jigfish2,2015-01-28 21:04:00,110,"Glenman12, Al and Kim are good hosts, enough said. Gone, fish it like any other lake, no tricks. We structure fish, jigging all of the time. I know people that slip bobber, and they do excellent also. Back trolling spinners or cranks is popular. You should have no problem locating fish, and doing well. It is an awesome body of water, with a big variety of catchable fish. Good luck, tight lines, and have fun."
3489914,Gone,2015-01-29 05:29:00,9,Outstanding! Thank you for your responses.
3436178,kriplur,2015-01-11 11:18:00,37,"anyone stay at keystone lodge on cedar lake on the east side of cedar lake south of Perrault falls, how is the fishing in this part of the lake. we usually just fish for walleyes."
3436610,ftfarms,2015-01-11 14:27:00,444,It looks like a nice camp. Haven't heard anything bad about it. We like to stay at cedar point resort because it centrally located and rays a good guy to talk with. We've fished all over the lake but we spend most of our time on the east side of the lake. We fish mostly walleye and some smallmouth.
3436834,bigwillies,2015-01-11 15:34:00,515,cedar is good all over.think cedar point is one of the nicest spots on the lake
3439610,revitup,2015-01-12 16:17:00,140,"Our group stays at Keystone lodge on cedar Lake. We will be there June 6-13 in 2015. Very nice family running the lodge. Good, honest people. Cabins are nothing special, but certainly nice. Boats are adequate as well with motors that have always run well. They offer a camp cookout during the week that is nice. they have a catch and release contest that is fun to get into. We fish the east end so it works great for us. Any more questions--pm me."
3443402,nitroman,2015-01-13 21:19:00,368,Ok revitup are we gonna finally meet this year lol! I will be there the same week as you again as it was a great week last trip! O and to the OP never stayed at keystone but we do stay at Cedar Point Resort. Fishing is good all over the lake. Caught the most walleye ever last year less than 30 seconds boat ride from our camp.
3444922,revitup,2015-01-14 10:56:00,140,I hope so Nitroman! I couldn't believe it but last year was significantly better than the year before. We will have to be a bit more purposeful in our plans to meet this year.
3445306,Simple Man,2015-01-14 13:27:00,92,we mostly target Musky but one of the best Walleye days of my life was on that side of cedar. We have said many times that if we go back to Cedar we will stay at Keystone.
3452769,twistedline,2015-01-17 15:42:00,10,once you clear the border how long does it take to get to cedar lake? Its getting harder to get the 2 guys I fish with to cross the border. we used to go to red lake but if I can cut a couple of hrs off maybe they will go for it. thanks Bill
3453161,Guest,2015-01-17 20:20:00,0,It take about 3.5 to 4 hrs to get to Cedar Bill
3456346,pale ryder,2015-01-18 20:26:00,1937,Fishing is good all over Cedar. I always stay at Clark's Northern lights resort and fish about 50% near the resort and the other 50% everywhere else.
