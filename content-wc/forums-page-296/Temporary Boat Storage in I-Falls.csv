Is anyone aware of a secure, enclosed facility that provides short-term storage? Thanks"
3469282,dutchboy,2015-01-22 19:40:00,5717,Call 1-800-FALLS-MN That's the chamber there. They will point you in the right direction.
3469546,Obabikon,2015-01-22 20:53:00,2370,Most Marina's on the Canadian side allow storage (at least the ones around Morson do). You wouldn't even have to drive it back across the border.
