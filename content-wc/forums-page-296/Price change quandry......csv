3486530,OffCourse,2015-01-28 07:10:00,17,"We have been going to the same place the last 4 years. We never really paid attention we were being charged for ""days fishing"" vs. ""night stayed"". We would arrive on Friday and leave the following Wednesday for example. We fished sat, sun, mon and tue since we didn't arrive until late afternoon/early evening. Last year we knew we could arrive early on Friday. Like 1 or 2pm early. We asked if we could fish. They said yes, not a problem. You will just be charged extra for bait and gas. So, it was nice to get in about 3 hours of fishing upon arrival.Well, this year things are changing. The price went up from 135/day to 145/day. Not really a big increase at all. The difference is, if we arrive on Friday and fish we will be charged an extra 145. So, our total bill for the exact same trip as last year will go up $195. Which is an increase of about 35%. yikes. Not sure what the group thinks or what I think. We can arrive Friday and just hang out, save $145. Or, if we fish it would cost an extra $145. Seems a little steep for 3 hours of fishing. Can't fish off the dock either. I guess the days of getting a ""deal"" for going in September are over. I will be curious to see if this impacts the number in our group too. We normally have anywhere from 10 to 14 people."
3486594,Obabikon,2015-01-28 07:34:00,2370,"A lot of places give decent discounts for September business. If you have a good relationship with the owner, I'd suggest being honest with them. Explain your concerns, and see if you can reach a compromise. A 35% price raise is way too much. Especially since this should already be a good year for most owners. (exchange rate aside, the price of fuel is down for everyone)."
3486642,OffCourse,2015-01-28 07:48:00,17,"We tried. The communication is not very good to be perfectly honest. Took 2 emails to get a response the last time. We asked why the change and it was days fishing. So, if we don't fish upon arrival we don't get charged the extra 145. I think most places charge per night so if we arrive Friday we would be charged??? It just stinks if we want to fish for a couple hours we will get charged a full day.I think there was an issue last year because we stopped and bought ""large"" minnows on our way up. They have minnows there and charge for extra bait. We took that revenue source away so I don't think they were very happy with us. But, the minnows we get from them are very small."
3486818,dutchboy,2015-01-28 08:22:00,5717,Just cancel. In Sept you won't have trouble finding another lodge.
3486938,MrSimon,2015-01-28 08:42:00,922,"Every place I've ever stayed simply charges by the night .... I've never heard of being charged for ""days fished""."
3486986,Shellback,2015-01-28 08:53:00,8083,"No mention if you are bringing your own boats, or using their's. Their boats, I can see a charge, not necessarily a full day though. If I'm spending money somewhere, I expect people to show they are interested in my business.If you are having communication problems, it doesn't sound like they are that interested in your business. I'd start looking elsewhere, with a group of 10 to 14, I think many lodges would be interested in your group. Missed about being charged for gas. So it's their boats. I'd try and negotiate a 1/2 day fee."
3487394,LOW1,2015-01-28 10:19:00,2828,"I suspect that the issue may not be just with your group and that it may have been brewing awhile. For example, if you are using their boats, etc, and many groups requested that they be allowed to use the resorts boats for an extra half day, over the course of the summer this could result in many lost rental days for the resort. The resort may have done this as an accomadation, but it really is providing a free service which they instead could properly charge for. If this was an American plan resort, would you expect a free lunch if you came early? It's kind of the same thing. But the resort owner is also at fault for not making his/her expectations clear and explaining why the charge is necessary. It is a shame that a customer-resort relationship could end over this. I think it fair that you pay market rate for what you use. I suggest that you try and determine a fair boat rental rate and fair compensation for the other services you receive and start another round of communication with the resort owner offering to pay this amount. But if you are ignored and don't feel that you receive fair value for what you are charged, look elsewhere and find a place where you and your group will be happy. One way or the other get the problem fixed before you go. You don't want to spend your time there thinking that you are being ripped off-that's no good for either side and no way to spend a vacation."
3487426,mt hook,2015-01-28 10:31:00,65,Id go to OB camp... If your not a ----- your last day is free.I think thats a reel (grin) good deal.
3487490,Pooch,2015-01-28 10:39:00,4619,"One of the camps we fish lets people arrive the afternoon or evening before their trip begins. They charge by the night. I think their plan is six fishing days and seven nights. With guests leaving in the AM and new guests arriving that afternoon or evening. They also let people who want to go out for a few hours the evening they arrive to pay a small charge to fish that evening. They are just covering their costs for fuel and bait for the extra time on the water. Not a big deal as long as incoming guests are aware of it ahead of time.Each camp is different, but in the end they need to cover costs incurred that are over and above their advertised ""plans"".We always pay the price to get out on the water the afternoon we get to camp. We are actually gaining an evening of fishing for a fair price. Beats setting around the cabin the first evening when you are itching to get on the water.Pooch"
3487922,mt hook,2015-01-28 12:15:00,65,"It is all about communication. If im going to a new camp I expect to be fishing the day I get there. (The time we agreed to)And you can bet I will ask,Will I be able to fish in a camp boat within 1 hr. after arriving, give or take.If the camp is not going to be ready for my group to arrive then why payfor that day. Im not unreasonable I understand people do dumb things,and boats/moters brake down. If a camp owner said to me, we have your cabin ready, but no boat.Id be P. As i said (we agreed to) Then we will have to come to somekind of agreement on the cost of that day.If my group is six hr. late thats our fault. We should still pay for the day.Hopefully the camp owner will maybe comp. a little but thats the wayit go.There are a lot of camps to chose from. Have a list of questions to askbefore you pay your deposit... The only dumb question is the one you didn't ask.In over 30 years of going north most camp owners will work with youif you let them know what you expect."
