3484530,tv4fish,2015-01-27 12:11:00,2694,"I don't know --- I think for me it's on the morning of the first day of fishing up in Canada. After our long driving trip up there, checking in at camp, getting a not-so-good first night's sleep, getting up and having breakfast and then motoring up to our favorite spot. It's when we all put our lines down in anticipation and that first walleye hits........ that's when the excitement starts."

3486146,Knoxabilly,2015-01-27 22:11:00,225,Those are some NICE fish for any age!!!
3458770,Weby13,2015-01-19 17:32:00,57,Being with family and friends in Gods country. A added bonus is watching the smile on your father and sons face when your little guy catches a big guy!!!

3462130,Pooch,2015-01-20 20:13:00,4619,"Live to jig.... Did you catch any of them!?On my original post, we caught a bunch of nice (20"" to 25"") walleye out of that drop off when that picture was taken. They were shallower, but we had slowly moved them deeper so we followed them until after a while the wind forced us off. It was getting choppy and the walleye had the feed bag on.Funny how we can remember the details of a moment in time on the water, but can't remember to bring milk home when asked?Pooch"
3462226,Live to jig,2015-01-20 20:50:00,159,"Yep we were banging them, the wind was blowing into the end of this little bay and we were about 14 feet off shore just slaying them."
3462346,pjshorthorn,2015-01-20 21:36:00,5654,"3 generations in the boat together is worth the trip alone. Catching a beauty of a fish with Grandpa and Dad watching will have your son returning for years to come. I bet he didn't mention a word about his catch to Mommy when he got home.. I have been blessed to fish with my Dad and son in the same boat together. This year we will be celebrating our 5th trip with 3 generations fishing together and milestone birthdays ( maybe ?) of 75, 50 and 20. PjShorthorn."

3463250,Carnhzkr,2015-01-21 08:59:00,964,"One of my favorite things is heading out in the morning on one of those glass-calm days when the sun is beginning to warm the cool water just enough to waft moisture into the air. The only sound you can hear is the steady purr of the outboard and you look behind to watch your boat's V spread from one side of the lake to the other. God, I love that!"
3463578,Hewhocookstomuch,2015-01-21 10:30:00,66,"First day on Lake Saint Joseph, find the Grassy Knoll, wet lines and fish on."
3463898,emma17,2015-01-21 12:37:00,436,"Mike, You've shared some tremendous pictures and videos and I really appreciate it, as does my family. Like you, watching my sons in action and having fun in such an amazing environment is as good as it gets for me. A quick story. Last year on LOTW I had the full spectrum of emotions watching my middle son, the struggling musky hunter. The joy was watching him work so hard to get his fish. The hurt was watching him completely break down in disappointment and frustration after failing to finish his retrieve and figure 8- he set his pole down to take his sweatshirt off, only to see a beautiful musky surface at the side of the boat next to the lure- his arms stuck over his head. That was the closest he's come in three years, including 5 guided musky trips and most of his own money to buy the equipment."

3453049,Carnhzkr,2015-01-17 18:12:00,964,"That's a good one. I love when it goes from, oh crap! to oh wow! We've all had that happen at least once. But then there's the one PJShorthorn mentioned in another post he referred to as a motor muskie. Everyone reading this has probably fallen for that for half a second when the 25 pound northern you think you have turns into a Mercury."
3453057,Carnhzkr,2015-01-17 18:17:00,964,"Mike said it best. That's what I love the most - watching one of my kids pull up a big one. High-fives all around, get the camera. I think that's why my kids like to fish with me, because I get more excited than they do."

I better to remember my blood pressure medicine I could stroke out with all the pitter pattering."
