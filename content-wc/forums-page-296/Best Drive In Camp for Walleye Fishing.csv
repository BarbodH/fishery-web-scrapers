3497938,walleye22,2015-02-01 08:35:00,59,Go up to the Red lake and Gullrock lake area. Drive the extra miles. Stay away from the Perrault/indian chain lake area. Not as good as further north in more remote locations. Fished them both for 40 years now. There is a difference. Gramps was a bush pilot in north Ontario. He knew a lot of folks and a lot of good fishing spots. Also....how is Clay lake doing anyway. I remember long ago it had a high mercury levels because of logging? How is that these days. Use to be good friends with the owners long long ago. Gettings owned the spot. Fished from like 77-82.

Very good fishing, great owners and awesome lake. We drive from Wausau, WI and is about 14 hour drive but well worth it. Good Luck"

To narrow it down a little, anyone know of drive to or boat in camp with less than 8 cabins, no RV sites, few (if any) other camps on the lake, and consistently good walleye fishing? We're basically looking for somewhere quiet and secluded that doesn't require the expense of flying in. Thanks in advance!"
