3478698,Pooch,2015-01-25 17:50:00,4619,"If I remember, back in the 1990's and early 2000's the fly in camps where we went, the weekly rate started taking some erratic price jumps and rates were changing a lot. I just can't remember. Do you? Seems like many camps went from pricing in CDN to US dollars about that time.Pooch"
3479322,zeebee,2015-01-25 21:30:00,1144,"The CDN$ has been inexorably tied to price of oil for the past 15 years or so.Not sure I would be taking that risk if I were running a business. All the costsare being absorbed in Canadian $ so it only makes sense that the revenue streamshould be in the same denomination especially if you are setting rates months in advance.It may be working in their favor this round but one year its gonna work against and bite them bad.If I were charging USD rates I would hedge my risk and lock in a sizable portion of my revenue at the time I set my rates.....enter into a 12mo currency swap contract untilthe next rate adjusting period. I doubt many lodges do preferring instead, to roll the dice. Prob is in a resource based economy, the volatility can be high as we are currentlywitnessing and, even wilder swings are not outside the realm."
3479674,Algoma Guy,2015-01-26 06:39:00,48,The more the merrier!
3480394,v-bay gord,2015-01-26 10:07:00,3168,Pooch......tried to pm you but your message box is full....
3471122,v-bay gord,2015-01-23 11:52:00,3168,"94.9 per liter. That's Canadian dollars. I suppose Bobby's could start charging in U.S. dollars to make a cool 20% bump-up! All is well in the ""Bay""...."
3471506,cbprov,2015-01-23 14:25:00,1010,76 cents a litre in winnipeg
3471682,bobbylfishermon,2015-01-23 15:17:00,241,"Thanks Gord, just wondering if gas was coming down like it is here, not quite as fast, but a good deal anyway, remember the gas war in Dryden, was it 2004 or around that,37cents a liter, we made a extra trip (3 ) that year , and it's stayed that way since. To us (my wife & I) spring, summer & fall in V-Bay are priceless!! Therapy for living in the States, you might say!! Thanks again."
3473026,F250,2015-01-24 04:15:00,75,WOW !! $.76 per liter !! Have not seen that in way too long !! How much is diesel ?
3474298,Manitou,2015-01-24 11:37:00,125,"Diesel is just over a dollar CDN per litre, you'll have to do the math...http://www.winnipeggasprices.com/"
3475314,zeebee,2015-01-24 18:14:00,1144,"The lodge Ive been going to recently, charges in CDN$ but in the past all the USD lodges Ive been to have accepted the CDN$ at par once they know Im a Canadian. Maybe you Americans should don a Canadian mask, canadian costume and learn the lingo....save a few bucks eh!."
3476154,Pooch,2015-01-25 04:27:00,4619,"My wife has a Kroger (grocery store) card and last night we filled up my Suburban for $1.47 a gallon! Like I said in another post, ""the cure for high prices is high prices and the cure for low prices is low prices"". There will be a day of reckoning for these too low fuel prices. Road diesel is nearly a dollar higher than gasoline locally. Off road diesel fuel prices are not much below road diesel. Fuel surcharges that were enacted several years ago by many commercial operators (delivery services, garbage PU, etc.) are still in effect.I don't see any camp owners gettin' rich. Looks like an interesting although tough way to make a living. Exchange rates cut both ways. High fuel prices and bait costs surely had to sting a camp owner who supplies both to their customers.Take into consideration the plus and minus exchange rates over the years, it all pretty much averages out for both countries.Pooch"
3477778,Carnhzkr,2015-01-25 14:11:00,964,"Hey Pooch, not to one-up you but I just paid 1 cent per gallon! We have a Hy-Vee Fuel Saver card and had accumulated $2.23 (my wife is a great shopper). Evidently there's a minimum charge of 1 cent per gallon. Talk about highway robbery! Twenty gallons for twenty cents. I wish I had taken a picture, but didn't think about that until I had driven away."
3477954,v-bay gord,2015-01-25 15:04:00,3168,"I would disagree with you on that point. While in the past five year the Canadian dollar has poked it's nose into the ""worth more"" sphere.....it's miniscule compared to where it has been in the dumps over the past twenty years. Remember May, 2001..... 65 cents on the dollar. Making money on the exchange rate is a long tradition in the fishing lodge business. This year is one of those years."
3478018,bloodman,2015-01-25 15:24:00,1415,Get ready cause were coming.
3466322,Lmbkiller,2015-01-22 06:36:00,639,I will run the 9.9 kicker in conjunction with the 225 then!!
3466530,Fisherman Ted,2015-01-22 07:25:00,461,"Nearly everyone I know including myself set prices over a year in advance. In this case rates were nearly par when we did.Sure this is great for some. But it goes both ways. 5 years ago it dropped over the winter and was .96 and we took it in the shorts.All part of the fun.....And to respond to the higher prices. Absolutely with US goods rise on imported goods in Canada. However here is the kicker. They too set their prices ahead of time and are not nearly as dynamic as the exchange rate. Sooooooo, right now US made boats (Lunds for example) are a steal. This is a rare case, very rare case where owners with cash to spare can invest heavily into their lodges. I personally am using this to upgrade everything from hot tubs to boats."
3466970,tooski,2015-01-22 09:14:00,393,"As I understand it the reason diesel is now more expensive is the clean air act in the US. By 2020 all sulfur must be removed from diesel fuel. It will continue to be the more expensive fuel. Just what was relayed to me, makes sense."
3467042,Carnhzkr,2015-01-22 09:40:00,964,"The only thing close to a hot tub I get when I'm in Canada is when my wife farts when we're spooning. It's not nearly as relaxing as a hot tub, but at least I don't have to dry off (usually)."
3467386,LOW1,2015-01-22 11:00:00,2828,"It will be interesting to see the affect on the real estate market. One would think that there will be a reduction in the number of Canadian buyers for properties in places like Arizona and Florida. On the flip side, now may be a good time to buy property in Canada if you have $USD. Prices will adjust to some extent because of this - up in Kenora, down in Phoenix? The big winners include Americans who borrowed $CDN from Canadian Banks - their loan payoff amount has gone down about 25% in the last year without making a payment if they have the $USD to take advantage. And the $CDN is still increasing in value relative to the yen. We might see more Yamaha outboards and fewer American made motors on Canadian lakes."
3469026,Obabikon,2015-01-22 18:39:00,2370,"This might sound ""greedy"". But to be honest... most resorts could desperately use a GOOD profitable year. The nice thing is that most places didn't increase prices this year, and won't increase next year either. Just trying to make a living. It isn't as easy or profitable as many here seem to think."
3470578,campchick,2015-01-23 08:54:00,96,"Have to agree with Obabikon. Resort owners could use a good year. Also need Fisherman Ted to explain why Lund boats are ""a steal"". I guess I'm economically challenged. Thanks in advance."
3470602,Fisherman Ted,2015-01-23 08:59:00,461,"Because their Canadian prices were set sometime ago to many Canadian dealers. Now the US dollar has surged, significantly. That Canadian price locked in by resorts (or anyone) this fall/winter is worth less by a large margin if you receive revenue in US dollars. -FT"
3470666,Algoma Guy,2015-01-23 09:26:00,48,"I am a small outfitter and could really use a GOOD year. Tougher border crossings, similar dollars, and slow economy have hurt business the last couple years. Maybe the bigger outfits weren't effected as much but being a smaller operation I could definately feel the hit. A strong american dollar and lower gas prices should help this year. As far as charging in american or Canadian dollars......I charge in Canadian. Heres the way I look at it......my american clients get a break on the price and my Canadian clients don't get gouged with the exchange rate. Everybody wins!"
3471058,bobbylfishermon,2015-01-23 11:29:00,241,"Hey V-Bay Gord, hope alls well in the Bay!!! How much is gas at Bobby's ??"
3465026,halfmoon007,2015-01-21 17:31:00,121,"its at 1.233 today, will it go higher?"
3465098,GNO,2015-01-21 17:40:00,153,It is predicted to be 1.27 by the end of June
3465386,v-bay gord,2015-01-21 18:34:00,3168,Good news for those who are paying their trip in Canadian $...
3465786,Fisherman Ted,2015-01-21 20:37:00,461,Yup. 1.30 by the summer.
3465930,Lmbkiller,2015-01-21 21:30:00,639,"Gas in Winnipeg is $0.86/ltr rite now......I'm not even goin to fish the week we go up, just rip around in the 225opti at WOT cuz it's practically free and a buttload of fun"
3465994,zeebee,2015-01-21 22:14:00,1144,actually its 77.9
3466146,Skywagon,2015-01-22 05:36:00,1106,"Crossed the border Tuesday pulling a trailer, on a quick trip to Illinois, was getting a little over 7 mpg. Paid as little as $1.79 for one fill-up, that sure helped to soften the blow. Was surprised to see diesel as much as $.70 more per gallon. What is that all about?"
3466194,Shellback,2015-01-22 05:48:00,8083,"I've seen diesel close to $1.00 more than regular gas here in the states. I've noticed in Canada it's usually a few pennies less than regular. I don't think it's taxes, because heating oil runs close to the price of diesel. At least here on the east coast it does."
3466202,Shellback,2015-01-22 05:51:00,8083,"So are you Canadians taking it in the shorts with the change in rates, or does it just affect you when going to the states? I guess any product coming from the states has had a big increase in price."
3466234,kayakmatt,2015-01-22 06:02:00,105,"I see very few Canadian resorts posting their prices in CAD$. Even the ones owned by Canadians. Should be a comparably profitable year for the owners with lower gasoline prices and exchange rates. I have yet to see any announcing ""We've Lowered our prices for 2015""!To be honest, I wouldn't either!"
