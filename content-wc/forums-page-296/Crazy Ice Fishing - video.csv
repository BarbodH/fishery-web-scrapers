We were fishing a drop off and the fish were thick, intense and very hungry. They were hitting soft body swim baits, slender spoons and large herring on tip ups. It was great to have the MarCum as I feel it helped me hook up on a lot more fish anticipating the bites. I also show a couple tips on how to lose less lures when fishing for big fish and how to rig a large bait on a tip up. Hope you enjoy the show. This is as high octane as ice fishing below - 25 degrees Celcius gets! Adrenaline rush ice fishing outdoors, haha Whoever knew it existed?Brandon"
