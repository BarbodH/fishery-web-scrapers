3451817,pjshorthorn,2015-01-17 07:56:00,5654,"The first three weeks of the season have always been enjoyable ,but quite a bit more unpredicatable in terms of weather patterns. Having said that, I've only been blown off the water one day over multiple trips during these weeks. I've also enjoyed the third week of September for the same reasons others have mentioned already. This year it will be the last week of July in order to accomodate everyone's busy schedules. PjShorthorn"
3451841,quickster2,2015-01-17 08:02:00,41,Had my repeatable best luck and mostly predictable weather fishing the new moon phase mid-July and early August. Our best fishing has been right after Labor Day on Namakan Lake when it rained all week with no wind. When we marked them we caught them! Almost anytime you have stable weather you will catch fish.
3453225,wallydave,2015-01-17 21:30:00,2151,"My first week of fishing week of fishing Ontario were the first week of June.My boat and cabin buddy's birthday was June 1st, that was also the first day we could fish the Wenasaga rapids. The fishing was crazy! Now that he is a teacher, that week isn't an option, plus the MNR has changed the timing of fishing the Sanctuary! My last couple of trips have been in August, on Red Lake, more stable weather, still great fishing! As mentioned before, any week in Ontario is great!"
3453297,Nimstug,2015-01-17 22:24:00,2605,"Roughly the days between September 9 and September 21, depending on how the weekends are organized that year. I love the chill in the air, minimal number of boats, fall colors, and the scent of the pellet stove in the cabin in the evening. Our ""big"" meal of the day is about 2:00, then we go back out until there is a hint of orange of on the west horizon and near black to west sky. NimstugLife is too short to have to deal with crummy ball point pens!"
3453393,forgop,2015-01-18 01:32:00,880,"I've only gone the 1st week of September and the 2nd week of August. I don't like bugs at all, so I don't have much interest in going much earlier, but due to my children going an their school calendar, we're going July 18-25 this year. That said, we ran into our fair share of skeeters in the evenings every time we hit the portage area in the mornings and evenings for the 2nd week of August. Don't think we'll be out going through any trails for portage or anything though this time around. It'll be my favorite week of the year this year because that's when I'll be there."
3454746,Fisherman Ted,2015-01-18 13:56:00,461,"I get to guide/fish (a little) and watch all my fishermen all summer long, year after year. By far the best time to fish is late May. Hands down in my opinion. Here is why: 1 - after the walleye have spawned they are super shallow, like 6-8 feet of water. And desperately hungry. With little to no food around (certainly no hatches and only minnow fry maybe around are perch) walleye are incredibly aggressive. And the BIG walleye (32+) are everywhere. Later in the summer they go very, very deep and are hard to target. In May you can catch them off the dock. 2 - BIG pike are also very shallow. a 45 inch fish will go super deep with warmer water. In May you can sight fish for them. Just a blast to throw a fly too. They are also chasing the smallies that are starting to pre-stage for their spawn which leads me to 3 - smallmouth is some of the best fishing of the year. Pre-spawn they are hungry (just after the winter) and easy to find. Small areas to target. Just killer fishing. And when fishing for smallies you will get big pike. 4 - And finally lake trout are everywhere. Very shallow. Best time of year to catch them as they will go hundreds of feet deep in warmer weather and certainly below the thermocline. May is one of the only times you can catch trophies in all species, all in shallow water. Sure, it can be chilly but we are fishermen and if the fishing is great weather means nothing! Man, I can't wait for the spring! -FT"
3455370,SinOrSwim,2015-01-18 17:03:00,1528,****!! You have any openings in late May?
3455770,Golden Eagle,2015-01-18 18:16:00,2642,"so I can fly in at ice out, locate spawning walleyes, follow them down the river as they move to the lake. Pike will find the walleyes and I'll find the pike. Pike will also be in shallow bays as they warm up. They'll be eating suicks and JSM. Being there the first week in June might reward me with a shiner spawn or two. Walleyes and big pike will be hanging around the shiner spawn until it's finished. I haven't done one of these since 2005 and I'm not sure if it will happen again, but it sure worked that one time. P.S. sort of. One evening we were into all female walleyes at the mouth of a river. Two otters were our competition. They let us know when a new wave of walleyes was passing through."
3469458,Rock Hound,2015-01-22 20:28:00,51,"By and large if I had my pick I would go the 2nd week of June, but the entire month of June can be good. Due to my work I can never go in May, so I cannot speak of any experience with that, but I know HUGE pike can be had in May. Some day I will fish all the months in Canada . . . retirement cannot come soon enough!"
3450425,SinOrSwim,2015-01-16 14:43:00,1528,take out the favorite time. What is the BEST time to catch big fish? Percentage wise that is. Odds.
3450441,Fishin Fun,2015-01-16 14:43:00,218,I don't care what week it is. The more weeks I can spend up there fishing the better. Unfortunately I only have 1 week a summer that I can go unless I want to miss some of my kid's baseball games. So that's the week I go. Back before kids I used to go spring summer and fall. Fishing always seemed better early spring and late fall.
3450545,JAY221,2015-01-16 15:06:00,877,"We go up the week after the fourth of July. The theory has always been that the weather would of settled down by then ,but it doesn't. That is also as soon as we can go & don't want to wait any longer. All trips have been pretty good. Later, Jay"
3450681,KSjim,2015-01-16 15:36:00,88,The second week of June has produced my best Canada trips. The walleye have almost always recovered from the spawn and are feeding heavily. Any current area or main lake point has the potential to be stacked with fish. If you hit it just right the big girls are ready to feed and come in waves.The other benefit of that time period is that big pike are often in the same areas. Normally a few big pike are caught while jigging for walleye. What a blast!And for me personally the cooler weather is a benefit. Layering up to stay warm early in the day and then starting the wood stove in the cabin at night to take the chill off is my kind of weather.
3450785,Carnhzkr,2015-01-16 16:20:00,964,"Luckily, I've been able to go on 2 or 3 trips for each of the past 10 - 12 years, but if I could only go on one, it would be late September for all the same reasons Bill K mentioned above. It can be absolutely beautiful that time of year and there's little competition. Of course, you're taking a big chance and it can be freezing that time of year. I've been in northern Manitoba in late September and put on every stitch of clothing I brought along and wished I could squeeze on another jacket over that."
3451073,Mike Borger,2015-01-16 18:38:00,1554,Probably the second week of June.
3451225,Duflebag,2015-01-16 20:03:00,218,"My favorite week is any week I am fishing in Canada. Seriously, second half of September by far."
3451281,kilroy1984,2015-01-16 20:55:00,126,"I live in Manitoba, I always take the 2nd week in june off work for bass and walleye, but this year I think I'm gonna take the 1st-14th off gonna be some sweet fishin"
3451633,BornToFish,2015-01-17 06:56:00,1224,"I agree with many of the insightful comments above about the various months of the fishing season. I've enjoyed fishing in spring, summer and autumn. However, my favorite month of the season is September for several of the reasons cited above. An additional reason is the relative absence of other boats on the lake. I've found that many anglers have already vacationed and are now on to their hunting seasons in their home state. I've consistently had my best success in terms of size and numbers of fish in September. Admittedly the weather can be fickle, but I'm still willing to deal with it. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
3451745,campchick,2015-01-17 07:36:00,96,"The second and third weeks of June consistently produce largest walleye. The fish are still schooled near spawning beds and are easy to locate. That being said, every week has something to recommend it. August numbers can rival those in June too. It's all good!!"
3450025,Mike Kansas,2015-01-16 12:39:00,1463,What is your favorite week to go fish your favorite Canadain lake and why would you pick that week. Mike Kansas
3450065,Pooch,2015-01-16 13:18:00,4619,"Everyone is guarding their secrets Mike!Mine? late June/July/August/early SeptemberWeather is more stable. Fish are starting to settle into or depending on the year, already into a summer pattern by early to mid July.Mid summer has fewer bugs, most years.Summer weather is great. Warm to hot days with cool nights for sleeping.Big reason? That's when I can get away for a week or two and I don't like fishing when I'm cold and uncomfortable anymore.Pooch"
3450105,Mike Kansas,2015-01-16 13:28:00,1463,"You cpuld be right Pooch, they are guarding their secrets. Or maybe they are like me give me a rod & reel a boat and a bucket of minnows and a handful of jigs and I don't care what day it is I'm going fishing. Mike Kansas"
3450145,HeHooksHimself,2015-01-16 13:36:00,725,"We like to go early, that way i know when all this friggin' snow melts, its time for fishing. If you can dodge the walleye post spawn lull, the walleyes are voracious. The pike are slower, since they are usually beat up from the spawn, but hungry. The lake trout are flopping around in the shallow water waiting for my crankbait to swim by. Whitefish are also in the shallows and big. Smallies ae just starting to bite. You never know what is on your line. No bugs, but rain, wind and cold temps make it a welcome challenge! Not that anyone is counting but 124 days from now we will be pulling out!"
3450201,JayM5209,2015-01-16 13:46:00,1050,"1.) The weeks beginning the 3rd Saturday of May and the 4th Saturday of May. Because: a) I like cold water and cool weather (70 degrees or higher is too, too hot to fish comfortably); b) I enjoy the challenge of figuring out what the spring weather has done to the fish and their behavior; c) those are the weeks my group has been going for 36+ years and I cannot get them to consider any other time.2.) Last week of August thru end of September. Because: a) weather is cooling down (see note above); b) the crowds have cleared out; c) the bugs have died or buried themselves in the mud; d) it's great to end the season with a fall solo trip; . . . . and it's fun to hear the diehard muskie guys telling lies about the follows they had that day! But, I am with you, Mike. Anytime is time well spent, regardless of the weather, the bite, the success, or lack thereof, of the catching part of the trip."
3450273,Mike Borger,2015-01-16 13:58:00,1554,"I like mid August. Cooler temps, stable weather, no bugs, and predictable fishing."
3450289,LOW1,2015-01-16 14:04:00,2828,"An unfair question. I try and go the week of Memorial day or the prior week, the week of Canada day, the first full week in August, and hopefully the last week in September. My favorite would probably be the last week of September, because if I go then its only 7 months till May. But if I don't, it's almost 9 months between early August and when I go in May. It may not sound like much, but that two month difference is the difference between a tolerable and a miserable off season. But there simply is no bad time."
3450313,Bill Krejca,2015-01-16 14:12:00,6107,"Favorite time is the last of September due to less/no bugs and less people on the water. Fish seem to be somewhat more predictable. I believe it to be the prettiest time of the year, and to me that is an important segment of the north woods experience. Bill"
3450321,port1042,2015-01-16 14:13:00,509,"I have fished Canada twice in the spring. Memorial Day week the last two years. Both years were late springs. It will be interesting to see what this year brings since we have had late spring and late ice out both times I have fished in the spring. Great temperatures, few bugs, great fishing. I have fished Canada three times in the fall. Labor Day week the last three years. We've been blessed and have only lost one day fishing to weather in three trips. Great temperatures, few bugs, great fishing. If I had to give up either the spring or the fall trip I'd give up the spring trip. I think it's just a little more likely to get screwed up with weather -- but no way am I offering to do that."
3450361,Lovetofish,2015-01-16 14:27:00,458,"I've not been to Canada in the spring, but I have been there every week of July and the first two of August and the second and third week of September. We've had wonderful trips every trip. It's awful hard for me to wait for, but August is my favorite. Less bugs, mostly stable weather, usually not hot, and the water is warm enough to swim and bathe in. Hope to make two trips this year, the second week of July and the second week of August."
