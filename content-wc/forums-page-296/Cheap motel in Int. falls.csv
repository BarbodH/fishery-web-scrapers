3463066,Bakefish,2015-01-21 08:05:00,1077,Made reservations yesterday at the Falls. Good luck. All I could get was a single with a rollaway bed as the second bed.
3464050,Simple Man,2015-01-21 13:33:00,92,"We got up mid-week so there are no issues with lines at the border...Most the time we drive straight thru, but we stayed once at America's Best Value Inns & Suites in I-Falls and it was decent and cheap. If you decide to stay there, walk a couple doors down and eat at the Chocolate Moose. My buddy swears by the place! Good Steak and Ice Cold Drafts."
3466290,WalleyeMatt,2015-01-22 06:24:00,93,The BBQ ribs are excellent also. Matt
3466458,JAY221,2015-01-22 07:09:00,877,"I know this doesn't fit the OP requirements but last year we crossed @ about 3:00 pm & continued on to Dryden in daylight & stayed @ the Colonial Motel. It was about 70 bucks & 1970 vintage decor. It was very clean. It sure was nice waking up knowing that the drive up 502 was behind us. Later, Jay"
3466850,JayM5209,2015-01-22 08:36:00,1050,"I've had quite satisfactory stays at the Hilltop in Int'l Falls. When I've stayed there I was not pulling my boat, and boat parking may be a bit tight.Another option is to plan the trip with the overnight stop in Eveleth or Virginia, MN. The Super 8 in Eveleth (right on Hwy. 53) and the Pine View in Virginia (a short jog off 53) have both worked very well for me. In fact, they are now a preferred stop rather than going on to Int'l Falls - a better place to break up my trip. For the past six or seven years my experience has essential involved no wait lines at IF. Always cross Saturday mornings. Northbound it is before 8 or 8:30 a.m. or after 11 a.m. and I haven't had more than four vehicles ahead of me. Southbound it is always between 10 a.m. and noon and the longest line was maybe 25 cars on the bridge southbound, usually it's 4-8."
3467530,bigwalleye1,2015-01-22 11:54:00,2632,an overnight north of the border may be a great deal.
3467706,TD 4,2015-01-22 12:46:00,5,WE also go all the way to Dryden. Stay at the Holiday Inn. Thay have a nice grill we use . It's the first night our group is together . 24 guys. Go to the Beer Store get some other supplies. Get up they have a descent breakfast . Get to camp and get settled in time to get in some good fishing time. Works for us
3459554,NARDA 1,2015-01-19 20:14:00,636,Wallydave gives good advice. Crossing Friday night will save you the hassle of waiting in line to cross on Saturday.
3459602,pjshorthorn,2015-01-19 20:42:00,5654,We used Super. 8 for quite a few years. On Hwy 53 going into town. Nothing fancy but we only cared about sleep after a long pull. At the time there was great space for truck and boat parking. I haven't been through the area in 6 years so I can't confirm how our old stop compares to current options. PjShorthorn.
3459634,twistedline,2015-01-19 21:01:00,10,I will probably check out the rainbow. driving a couple miles down the road to be on the other side of the border would be worth it to me. we usually cross about 330-400 and it isnt that bad hopefully the other 2 will go for it!! thanks all Bill
3459666,pjshorthorn,2015-01-19 21:30:00,5654,"Do the other two members get to choose if you are driving???? If the vehicle isnt yours on the trip, offer to drive the last leg into Intl. Falls and then"" drive it like you stole it"" right to the border. Explain that the owner of the vehicle is in the back seat and has been ill for a little bit and it wasn't safe for them to drive. Explain you have reservations at Rainbow in FF and you need to get your ill fishing partner to the motel so you don't get sick from being in the same vehicle together any longer. After you cross the border, I don't have any advice on how to handle any other spirited discussions that may ensue, ,but you will have a place to sleep and a great start to your trip.!!!! PjShorthorn."
3460090,dutchboy,2015-01-20 06:34:00,5717,If you insist on crossing..............Rendez-Vous is on the river and nice 800-544-9435
3460146,ftfarms,2015-01-20 07:11:00,444,I would do as much talking to your buds and cross into Canada and than stay. We get there usually earlier enough on Friday to get everything takn care of. Buy booze license bait whatever we need. No fighting a crowd. Makes Saturday a nice easy worry free day.
3460258,IaDave,2015-01-20 07:49:00,476,I've stayed there numerous times- it is fine for a night.
3460266,Bill Krejca,2015-01-20 07:52:00,6107,"I realize you stated your group wants to stay in IF, but if it is at all not out of your way, I suggest staying at The Walleye Inn in Baudette. Price is right, lots of room for safe boat parking, good eating close-by, little or no waiting to cross in the morning. I've been doing it for years. Bill"
3461746,alanexpup,2015-01-20 18:24:00,278,HI. we used to stay on the us side on Friday but we finally figured it out that the line on Saturday was not worth on this side. when we did we would stay at the holiday inn. on the Canadian side we would stay at the red dog or that place at the eastern end of town on the lake. I forget the name but it was very nice too.
3462098,Whopper,2015-01-20 20:02:00,340,I've stayed at a place called Voyageurs in International Falls. Inexpensive and clean. It's right next to the Husky gas station.
3458946,twistedline,2015-01-19 18:13:00,10,I was looking for a cheap place for 3 guys to spend friday night before we continue on our trip into canada. not looking for anything fancy just some place to sleep. we usually go at the end of may also needs to be on US side per request from fishing partners!! thanks Bill
3459026,dutchboy,2015-01-19 18:30:00,5717,"Falls Motel on Hwy 53.218-283-8434Also the Hilltop Motel is very nice, however if you have a big boat parking can sometimes be a challenge."
3459114,Fishin Fun,2015-01-19 18:42:00,218,I would like to know the same thing. We have 7 guys with 2 trucks and 19ft boats. Any suggestions are appreciated. Thanks!
3459194,pike50plus,2015-01-19 18:52:00,584,or onetravel.com
3459314,twistedline,2015-01-19 19:21:00,10,Also if you happen to have a general price per person. I would prefer to keep going or sleep in the truck but the other 2 are a little older!!thanks Bill
3459322,dutchboy,2015-01-19 19:27:00,5717,"Sorry, you will need to call for prices. There are a bunch of motels in the Falls. Most you will find to be in $50 - $70 range I think. Just call. I will say this..................Friday nights will fill up!! Call and get reservations if you plan on hitting town after 6 pm. You aren't the only guys waiting to cross in the morning. Don't worry about theft. In the 15 years of going there I have never had a problem or heard of any. Take proper precautions, cover the boats or take the tackle boxes and rods in the rooms. Have fun guys!"
3459370,gowrlop,2015-01-19 19:40:00,109,"We've been staying at the Hilltop for the past 7 years. It's a clean, comfortable and affordable spot. Our group of 7 will be there again in July."
3459378,wallydave,2015-01-19 19:41:00,2151,"We have found crossing the border Friday and staying in Fort Frances a good way to beat the Saturday morning line crossing the border. The Rainbow Motel is pretty reasonable, check with Gordon about one of the remodeled rooms, pretty nice for around 60 a night. Boston Pizza is just down Kings Highway for Friday night pizza Tim Hortons for coffee and a breakfast sandwich or donuts Sat am. Most Friday night you might have one or two cars ahead of you. Good luck!"
3459490,Fishoil,2015-01-19 20:04:00,1277,I'll second the Rainbow if you want to cross the night before to avoid the morning lines. Our group stayed there for several years and still would if we still crossed the border at IF/FF.
3459514,Fishin Fun,2015-01-19 20:08:00,218,I just booked the Falls Motel for our trip. I checked out their website and their rooms like adequate. I guess I'll find out. Thanks for the tip!
