3408770,rsiminski,2014-12-31 09:56:00,53,Whats the name of the book?
3409114,Fishoil,2014-12-31 11:02:00,1277,"""A North Woods Fisherman's Story""It's a great read. I've loaned my copy to several of my Canadian fishing trip friends (sorry Bill) and they all enjoyed it immensely. I highly recommend it!!"
3409282,walleye22,2014-12-31 11:29:00,59,"I now want to get this book as well. Just read some of the previews and the story I read reminded me of my gramps. His last year up there he was 91 and alzeihmers was taken over. His hands were brutal as he worked on the railroad and was a brickmason his whole life. I would tie everything for him and even help him shower. How he loved his Canada fishing trips. I also remember when I was young up there a older guy that went with us was very sick with cancer and couldn't even fish but went anyway and we would take him down to the dock and set him in a lawn chair and he loved just sitting there looking over the lake and watching folks come in with the catch for the day and talking. He passed about a week after we got back. I didn't really understand it when I was 8 years old but I sure now that I am 43. Going to Canada ""fishing"" sure is a **** of a lot more than just ""fishing"" boys. Enjoy your time up there."
3409474,Blackmacs,2014-12-31 12:15:00,2121,That's how I got there 48 years ago too.
3409498,Simple Man,2014-12-31 12:25:00,92,What a great topic! I always enjoy hearing others stories. 3 of us went for the first time in the mid 90s and we were all in our young 20s. We had no idea what we were doing...I think the only food we really took was a sack of potatos and some milk so we had to rely on the fish we caught. It was still a blast! I didnt go back until 2009. My best friend who was also on that first trip had started going back a couple years prior and he had planned the 2009 trip while I was still in Afghanistan. His brother was was scheduled to go up with him had a work conflict and the trip was scheduled for about a week after I got home from deployment. To my wife's credit she suggested I fill the spot on the trip....it takes a heck of a wife to allow me to go on that trip after being overseas for a year and only home for a week...I think she sensed teh time on the shield would do me some good! I will always be grateful for my friend inviting me and my wife saying its ok to go because we've been back every year since and no plans to ever miss a trip again. Thanks for the stories and Happy New year to everyone!
3409642,Bill Krejca,2014-12-31 13:02:00,6107,"OK,I'll go ahead and share a bit. My parents took me up to LOW when I was 11 months old. The year was 1939! I've been going north ever since. Although I didn't catch much the first few years, I've done alright since then. Dad had made the first north woods trip in 1926, camped out on LOW in 1936, took a 4hp motor and rented boat, tripped by water from Nestor Falls to north of Sioux Narrows (original destination), after first getting lost, and inadvertently nearly making it to Morson. He had a very good memory, and kept most every paper associated with each trip. His early trips were the days of silk casting line, wooden plugs, pulling the lure away from the small fish, damp tents, and taking turns all day rowing while the other fished. As he said shortly before he passed away at age 95, he ""Saw a lot, did a lot, fished a lot, did OK"". We still continue to fish together some nights. Bill"
3410114,Knoxabilly,2014-12-31 15:54:00,225,"My Dad got me into fishing when I was young. I always wanted to go do a bass trip but those are much more expensive. While at the Des Moines fishing show we started checking out booths and came across Golden Fawn Lodge's booth and were impressed. My Dad knew someone who had been to Lac Seul and loved it, so he booked the trip. My Uncle, Dad and I for the first trip in 96'. My Uncle caught a 42"" northern that trip that I netted and couldn't even hoist into the boat. Been going every year since- the lodge and fellow anglers have changed over the years. I don't think I'll ever not go, it's the best trip!"
3410410,Carnhzkr,2014-12-31 18:22:00,964,"Remember Green Stamps? If not for those freebies, I'd have likely never crossed the border. As the family lore goes, my dad took a trip to Ely with his uncle when he was around 14. That would have been about '42, and the way he tells it, Ely was the end of the road back then, and you had to be a determined outdoors man to dare attempt the adventure. Since that boyhood trip, it was my dad's ambition to fish Canada. In the early 60s, he bought a 14' runabout with a 50hp Merc. He read an article in the local newspaper about the fabulous fishing in Northern Manitoba and his mind was set on dragging his family of six, along with grandma, to the end of the earth where the walleye jumped into the boat and the pike were as long as an oar, or so he thought.Being farmers, my dad routinely made large purchases for things like fertilizer, seed, and cattle feed, and the suppliers gave Green Stamps. Over the course of several years, they'd saved enough to trade in books of stamps for a yellow canvas tent, two army cots, sleeping bags, Coleman stove & lantern, and one of those green metal Coleman coolers.There's some debate in the family as to where we went that first year, but I think it was Reed Lake in northern Manitoba. Can you imagine loading my dad, mom, grandma, and four kids into a '65 Oldsmobile connected to a homemade boat trailer and heading north with only a vague idea about what to expect when you get there? My dad had no idea how to fish back then. All he knew was to cast red & white spoons, and supposedly you couldn't keep the fish away. My mom hated every minute of those early trips. She explains that she used to count down the days and give herself pep talks to convince herself she could make it to the end. I can't say as I blame her, with no electricity or refrigeration. My mom is far from a prude, but I think those early trips would have been difficult for any sane person to endure. Since those first several tenting trips, they slowly progressed to a borrowed pickup topper, then a rented camper, and today pull a fifth-wheel/boat tandem, and she looks forward to their two trips north with great anticipation.I've only missed a few years when attending college and when I lived in Texas, otherwise I've probably crossed the border somewhere around 60 times since then. I still take my parents up each September, but my Canadian trips really hit home for me nine years ago when I began taking my own family of four. That's when it went from feeling like I was tagging along on dad's trip, to my trip.My parents are now in their mid-80s and will be fishing the Caribou Falls area of the English River until my dad is no longer breathing, and when that day comes, I'll slowly pour his ashes into the fast water of South Boundary Falls."
3481194,Simple Man,2015-01-26 13:35:00,92,Great pics. You had a great day on the water that day for sure!
3485098,eyelegend,2015-01-27 16:43:00,9,"Made my first trip up North in 2003. My friends dad had been going for years and finally convinced our 22 year old butts to go with him. We had no idea what it would be like. I had always just been a trout and largemouth bass fishermen and never experienced pike and walleye. My friend was even less experienced than I was. The trip was a grueling 15hr drive straight through the night but being with your best friend and bs'ing the whole time makes it bearable. It was the end of May, the bugs were insane. We were prepped but nothing that anyone says could prepare you for how bad it can be. We learned a ton that year and probably lost a couple hundred dollars in lures doing so. My two highlights which I will never forget from that trip. - Breaking the pull cord at the very end of the lake with no wind on a 90+ day. Luckily we let everyone know where we were headed and were only stranded for a few hours - The last day if rained so hard you could barely see. My buddy and I found a spot and probably caught 50 walleye each in the pouring rain. To top it off we each landed a 30"" Pike which was a huge deal for us. This will be our 11th trip, missed a few back in '05-'06. The trip is something that we talk about year round. Our wives have grown accustomed to it by now and I really believe they understand how important it is for us to get away. Anyone who has been knows what I mean. I count down the days every year as soon as I get back home. Love it up there."
3486042,team walleye,2015-01-27 21:24:00,336,My dad and uncle introduced me back in 2003. They both had been going since the late 80's and 90's. I'm hooked!! I love NW Ontario!
3486138,muskyman73,2015-01-27 22:09:00,402,"I was in 8th grade back in 1986 on my first Canada trip. We stayed at Canadian Haven with Glenn and Lorraine. I caught my first walleye, northern and smallmouth bass that trip. I was sold hook , line and sinker. Grabbed every Field & Stream and any magazine that had an article on LOTW. May 21 was engraved in my brain. I studied any maps I could get my hands on and waited for the next trip. Pure insanity."
3488082,jWN,2015-01-28 13:19:00,62,"My dad was going before was born(1972) I still remember the excitement of his buddys and him as they were leaveing ever spring headed north. At age 12 I was allowed to go and have made meny trips with him to the far north. I would like to say we slayed them every time but we did not,( have had trips that most would not beleve also) it was always an adventure thou. One thing that has amazed me in the past is when we have had break downs(broken leafs on trailers, also on the old scout once, transmission issues, hole in boat and some others) how helpful the locals were in getting us back on the road. Thank you Canada!"
3488138,Carnhzkr,2015-01-28 13:59:00,964,"Over the years, there have been many times when the situation looked pretty grim, but we always managed to find help somehow and lived to tell the tale. It would have been about 1975ish, we were on our way home from the Churchill River in far northern MB. The water pump on my dad's truck decided this was a good place to die, about 35 miles north of Grand Rapids on a long desolate stretch of blacktop.Seeing the hood of our truck in the air and my dad's rear end sticking out, a lonely trucker stopped to lend a hand. The two men diagnosed the issue with the water pump and since he was heading south anyway, he'd take dad into town. We assumed we'd see dad hitching a ride back to my mom and me as we stayed with the rig, but after 90 minutes or so, here came the familiar looking truck. The two men worked on the problem and after what I'm sure was an infinity of swearing, they realized they'd bought the wrong water pump. Back into Grand Rapids and once more back to the broken truck. With the correct water pump installed, the trucker was finally on his way refusing any type of payment for his half-day lost and 150 miles of road time.I was only about 13 when that happened but it made a big impact on me. I've pulled way more than my share of stranded motorists out of snow banks. I always look for ways to pay it forward."
3488386,freespoolin,2015-01-28 15:00:00,472,"We ""discovered"" New France in about 1650 and have been here ever since except for a brief stay in PA prior to 1710. I love reading all the stories of you folks who have come to the ""Great White North"", driving 1500 miles non-stop. We take what we have here for granted. People here complain about having to drive more than 3 hours to find fishing. I have fished in Manitoba and NW Ontario since I was 3 years old. I remember my grandfather rowing a boat at Ignace while I trolled a Lazy Ike out the back, searching for a ""pickerel"" for supper. I remember trolling into Lone Island Lake in Manitoba's Whiteshell and my 2 year old sister throwing her new sandal overboard while my dad attempted to retrieve it with his folding landing net. Camping at Wallace Lake on July 1 where it froze overnight, the mist covering the lake until 10 am. Fishing at Grand Rapids MB in the late '50's just after Manitoba Hydro had built the dam and power station. So many walleyes we just threw them into a little rock crib on the shore of the river. If they jumped out it didn't matter because we'd catch another in a minute. Fishing at the Narrows on Lake Manitoba in the fall, anchored for walleye and watching the garter snakes swimming across to their dens. So many memories but more to come..."
3488594,KSjim,2015-01-28 15:52:00,88,"Watching Harold Ensley's fishing show the Sportsman Friend in the 1970's. Always dreamed of fishing in Canada. Would attend the KC Sports Show and get brochures from all the Canada camps.Then I got married had a son and the dream was put on hold. Finally in 1997, at the age of 41, I headed to a fly-in lake out of Red Lake. The trip was everything I hoped it would be and more! I have not missed a year since."
3488650,Carnhzkr,2015-01-28 16:11:00,964,"Thanks for the memories, freespoolin. Speaking of garter snakes, one of the things I remember about the breakdown north of Grand Rapids I wrote about above is that for miles and miles the road and rocks lining the road were absolutely covered with dead garter snakes. My mom was freaking out about the snakes everywhere. We didn't have a toilet in our pickup camper, so eventually nature dictated that she had to go behind a bush and she had me watch guard (big mistake). What self-respecting 13 year old boy could pass up an opportunity like that? Of course I had to scrape a stick along the rocks and make hissing sounds, ""there's one coming"". As I recall, she didn't dawdle too long."
3467330,Guest,2015-01-22 10:44:00,0,"My first trip across the border was in 1957. I was 14 and had been counting the days doing extra farm work to keep in the good graces of my dad. We fished on Manitoulin Island and I was hooked for life. I started arranging trips for guys and families when I was 19 and have been doing so ever since. I have had over 40 trips. My favorite spots have gradually migrated from the east to the west in Ontario. Most of the early trips (the 1960s and 70s) were in the Geraldton area on the Wintering River complex with Wintering Lake (dad caught 2 over 9 pounds in less than 1/2 hour) and Gamsby as the primary spots. We also fished the Longlac area, Flint etc. Other trips included the lakes north of Wawa and Hawk Junction. In the early 80s I moved north and west to the lakes north of Red Lake, Ontario. For several years we flew off Packwash just north of Ear Falls. A 140 air mile trip put us on Meanderine and Cherrington on the Manitoba border. Currently I am fishing Lac Seul, a fairly daunting piece of water requiring a bit of help from electronics and satellites (guess I'm getting old). As I look back over the years, I could not imagine what life would have been like to not have been able to be there. You develop and bond with the trees, the water, and the rocks and the bond is important and will remain as long as there is a way for people to enjoy them. I envy those who are younger who can look ahead to many more years of being there. Rocky"
3468026,MrSimon,2015-01-22 14:37:00,922,"My grandfather starting taking us to Canada when we were young. He took us up many times over the years. Two summers ago, to say thank you, I took him on a trip up. We had a wonderful time. He passed away this past October. You guys know what Canada is all about so you understand the memories ... I don't need to explain them here. The first picture is our very first trip. I'm wearing the green hat. The second picture is him on our trip in 2013. It was the last time he ever wet a line."
3468338,Carnhzkr,2015-01-22 15:56:00,964,"I love those older pics, mrsimon. I wish my parents had taken more of them, but it was expensive developing film back in the day. Even if it was a crappy picture, you still had to pay for it. Guess I haven't learned that lesson myself though, 'cause my wife and I don't take nearly enough pics either. I know there's one of me when I was about 6; huge smile on my face, standing on a seat in the back of dad's boat with my rod extend outward and a hammer handle hanging from the end of a Dare Devle. Wish I could find that pic."

I had dreamed of a fishing trip to Canada for some time; went to an All Canada Show in Milwaukee and signed up for a week on Eagle Lake, along with my high school age son. We had a great time, caught lots of fish, met some great people, and I was ""hooked."" Now, 2015, and I will make my 28th year trip to Northern Ontario. I have now fished 26 lakes in N. Ontario, but have settled the last 12 years or so on two lakes, both of which I fish for 2 consecutive weeks. Now, its my son(s) and grandsons, and ol' retired doc lee. This is where you will find me until I am pushing up daisy's in the back yard and smiling down on the folks who are heading to beautiful northern Ontario! Enjoy!"

My dad and uncle were avid walleye fisherman and Canada was an annual vacation trip. It started with trips to eastern Ontario, the 50 plus years has been western Ontario, typically the Kenora area. Last year I introduced my grandson to canada, he was 11 months old! Of course my sons were introduced years ago at a young age. The tradition continues within our family!"
3475466,Braggart,2015-01-24 18:57:00,22,"My story is pretty standard. or so it looked to me. Grew up in a Canadian family that spent weekends and summers at ""the lake"". Nothing fancy, we were far from wealthy. Learned the love of being on the water from my father and numerous uncles that spent weekends with us. It was a magical time, the 70's and early 80's. Family ""spent time"" with each other. Everyone was welcome. The cabin was more of a shack than a palace, but we always found room for everyone. There was no TV, no video games, no movies. We played cards at night, to the scratchy sound of the 8 track in the background. Adults slept in the beds/bunks, kids on the floor with the resident mice. At first light, we raced for the dock. Boats were loaded (tinners and car toppers), gear split up. Fishing was usually productive, as LOTWs was eager to please. Pike were released, walleye (pickerel) were coveted and retained. We ate what we caught, and rarely was anything transported home. At the end of the weekend, we closed up shop and made the trek home, only to return 5 days later. It was only when I got older that I realized how fortunate I had been. I also came to realize how different today's lives had become. Family time had to be planned. Electronics have now taken over. Values are often questioned. The world had changed, seemingly overnight. So... In an effort to try and make some new memories with my kids and some close friends, here's something we hope to make an annual event. I grew up loving the outdoors, and I'm hoping to pass some of that love along!http://www.xtremesportfishing.com/fo...php?f=1&t=1801"
3420866,SinOrSwim,2015-01-05 08:29:00,1528,"Yes, things have changed though. I know at least one private catholic school that doesn't allow you to make up any work you might miss to keep parents from taking their kids on vacation during the school year. Which, I think is utterly ridiculous but they can't just get zero's on all that.He would miss a full week. Plus, this is a guys trip and the language, drinking and gambling may not be the best thing for him at this age yet. LOL I'll figure it out though."
3421002,Fishoil,2015-01-05 09:12:00,1277,"My kids went to a small town public school and it was about 10 years ago, so not much of a problem. We've been doing the guys' trip thing for 25 years and as we all aged and had kids it became less about the guy stuff and more about a relaxing, fun vacation. We always encourage guys to bring the kids along. We have three families with three generations each that go on our trip along with several singles. Sure, the kids get exposed to some language and drinking but nothing that anybody is ashamed to have them see (usually ). It's a good life experience for them. I hope you can get it worked out for your boy, the trip will give him memories and lessons that will last a lifetime. It seems to be a common thread in a lot of these posts."
3421442,Steve Ediger,2015-01-05 11:52:00,97,"When I was a very young boy my Grandfather got me hooked on fishing. I remember going to my grandparents home and watching Virgil Ward and Harold Ensley fishing shows on TV with my Grandpa. I loved the shows where they went to Canada and from then on I knew I wanted to go there. As I grew up and developed my own fishing buddies, I always tried to talk them into planning a Canada fishing trip but they always thought it would cost too much or they didn't have time, or whatever, but we never made it. In 1997, my wife and I were attending a local Ducks Unlimited banquet. One of the items being auctioned off at the banquet was a one week fishing trip to Tall Pines Camp on Wabaskang lake. Evidently, no one else shared my desire to go North and the trip sold for like $30.00. Well the next summer my wife and four year old son loaded up and headed for Wabaskang which is about 1100 miles from our home in North Central Kansas. We didn't know what to expect, and that just added to our excitement and feeling of adventure. Needless to say, we had a fabulous time. Our week was over in a flash. My four year old son actually cried when we told him we had to go back home. Since 1997, my wife, son, and I have gone to Canada every year. In 2006, my son and I started going twice a year, and in 2010 I started going three times. I have now made the 1100 mile trip 32 times and wish it could have been more. We now go to Lac Seul Lodge, in fact, I had the good fortune to be able to take the current owners of the lodge up there for their first visit in 2006. They loved it so much they bought the lodge. I love it too!!!!!"

Found a lodge via the Sports show in Harrisburg. After I caught a nice one suitable for mounting I started to dabble with the pike. I have been going back ever since 20 plus years now. Thank you to Canada for hosting us. I appreciate your countryman's hospitality, courtesy and overall good nature. I love it there and considered buying a cabin when I retired. The difficulty so many lakes and so little time. I now do an annual trip from South Central PA to the Sunset Country in Ontario what a great place and worth the two day drive each way. I am now chasing a 40 inch northern and 20 inch small mouth, to be released after measuring and a photo. Thanks again my neighbors to the north."
3432050,rsiminski,2015-01-09 12:59:00,53,I just recieved my copy of A North woods Fisherman's Story. I read it from cover to cover in one sitting. What an awesome book to read. I have always been fascinated by the early days of fishing the Canadian wilds And often pondered what it would be like to encounter the early days. This book puts you in the drivers seat and makes you believe your actually experiencing the fishing back then. Wonderful read and cant wait to hit the water. Thanks for the info on this book.

Thirty five years later, I began making fishing and hunting trips to Ontario. My wife and I fish the walleye opener in May. Last year, the ice went out the day before the season opened. It was cold and wet, but we had a fantastic fishing experience. I've been lucky to fish lakes in less popular areas ... quiet, peaceful, beautiful. No noise other than nature. In the future, I hope to venture into other provinces to the west."

3411890,itsme,2015-01-01 11:02:00,31,"I was 21 years old. It was 1951 and we had a 1939 Cheve coupe. My wife and I wanted to see Canada and to catch a big fish. We ended up @ Larson's Hotel near the Lake of the Woods. Hired a guide at the ""governor's dock"" and off we went to ""Bald Rock"" and 23' of water. ""John"" taught us how to fish with a jig and minnow. We had our limit early in the morning so we went to a shore lunch which was just super. First time ever with pure fresh walleye. WOW!!! He asked if I could cast and of course after weeks of practice in our back yard I said yes. He took us to twin bays with shear rock walls. He picked out a jointed 6"" lure from my limited tackle box. John said cast about 2 or 3 ' beside that rock. Sure enough ""ole joe"" hit that lure and headed for the weed bed. I saw cork and thumbed down. The line rose out of the water covered with lily pads. Then a POW the line broke and ole joe had another broken hearted fisherman. This was 20# Cortland line and all I had was the 50' no longer on my reel. John said just sit still and you will see ole joe. Sure enough out of the water came this huge Northern trailing my line. I was hooked and except for time in Korea and England I have fished every year most times twice."
3412258,Richard B,2015-01-01 14:01:00,735,"My first time was in 1973 at the ripe old age of 14. My Dad wanted to show the entire family where his grandparents homesteaded around Winnipeg. It was very interesting to say the least with him talking about the farm and how his grandparents hunted, fished, and farmed the land. We stay in Winnipeg for 4 days and really enjoyed ourselves. Then we got in the car expecting to be heading back to Indiana and Dad asked if anyone wanted to go fishing. My 2 brothers and I enthusiastically said yes. We went to Red Indian Lodge. We started out the first day and I caught 2 walleye for shore lunch. It was very interesting to watch the guides fillet the fish and get everything ready for us to eat. While they were fixing lunch my older brother caught 2 walleye off a plastic worm. These where added to the fish fry. The afternoon became nasty. We got back to the docks just before a big storm came rolling in. The second morning started with rain and a light chop but the fish were going nuts. All 4 of us caught our limits of walleye before lunch. We had sandwiches for lunch but the guides did have a nice fire on shore for us to warm up. We started fishing for Northern and caught so many that I thought my arms were going to fall off. The third day started out like the previous with us catching walleye after walleye. Then the guide asked if we were ready to fish for pike again and my dad and I said absolutely. I caught a 38 inch northern that followed my lure about 2/3rds of the way in before it smacked the heck out of it. My dad had a monster fish on, don't know if it was a Muskie or a Pike but it broke the line beside the boat. My brothers and I have loved Canada ever since. We got back to Canada 1 time before my dad died at 54. My brothers and I still go up. Thank God we all have families that love the peacefulness, beauty, the people, and relaxation of Canada. I do not believe there is anywhere else that comes close."

He and I made the trip in 1996. Didn't know much about Canadian waters or walleye/northern fishing, but we caught fish and had a lot of fun. Next year we saw a Fishing Hot Spots ad for a camp a little farther north - The Old Post on Lake St. Joseph, again in NW Ontario. Four of us went there in 1997, and we've been going ever since. The group size has ranged from 4 to 12, the fishing has been spectacular, and the camp is so cushy that we're hooked. The trips have included sons, daughters, wives, and many good friends. Wonderful memories, laughs, and great comradery. It's been a great joy. John"
3420298,jackmaloney,2015-01-04 21:14:00,9,"My dad started bringing me in 1983 when I was 3 years old. I've got some funny pictures of myself walking around the boat in a diaper playing in our minnow bucket (and probably killing all our bait). My dad always took a ""guy's"" trip each Spring which was just with his buddies, but then we always took a family trip together each summer. When I was 11 years old, I was old enough to start going on the guy's tip each year, as well as our annual family trip later in the summer. That allowed me to take two trips to Lake of the Woods each year for about a decade, which was great. It was during that period that I truly fell in love with Canada. The amazing memories we made while fishing the lake and talking about the usual guy nonsense. Isn't it crazy what guys can talk themselves into when there aren't ladies around? Let's just say I've eaten my fair share of live bait as a result of losing a fishing bet. The annual family trip sort of combined with the guys trip starting around 2001 (basically the women weren't invited anymore). That meant I only I got one Canadian trip each year, but it was with just the guys, so it was a blast. Now, I find myself doing a weekly countdown to the trip each year (this becomes a daily countdown around May 1 since we go up the last week of June generally). Most of the funniest memories of my life took place on a boat in Canada, and I can't wait to start bringing my own sons up there eventually so they can have the same experiences."

We talked to a ton of different outfitters. We ended up going with Walsten Outposts (name?) out of Kenora. Went through them for about 4 years. Had some fun and crazy trips in those early years. We have gone every year since (minus one for me due to work). MorganMan is the only one who has not missed a trip since the beginning. I took my 9 year old on his first trip last summer. We took a second trip since he isn't quite old enough to do our ""guys"" trip. But, he may go this year? Possibly. He absolutely loved it. THe problem is we go when he is in school.

Eventually my dad started going and then myself for the first time in 1982 when I was 17. My first trip still seems like just yesterday. We boated in from Deception Bay to Taylor Island on Lac Seul hauling all our gear, food and gas in three boats with nothing more than a map to get us there. 6 guys sleeping head to toe in a tent, no outhouse, snorning so loud I had to sleep outside most nights, broke the wooden bow seat in half with my behind when we were running across big water in a storm( swore I wouldn't ever go out again) ,didn't have a strike for the first three days while my uncle is pulling in fish left and right, a bonfire that got a little large, exploring our way up to Bear Narrows and Chamberlain Narrows, bathing in the lake with the water in the 50s, seeing moose and eagles for the first time and more stars then I knew ever existed. I've been back every year since 1996 and have so many memories to remember and share with friends, but many will never compare to that first trip. It was also the last time I got to fish with my grandfather. To this day I salute Taylor Island every time I pass it on every trip to that part of Lac Seul. Thanks Gramps!!!! PjShorthorn"

Stayed in a tent, Did this for 4-5 years but at that time it seemed like the fishing was getting worse every year. Tried a few other lakes near there always tenting. Eventually ended up fishing a chain of lakes on the Mississagi river and staying in a gravel pit by the bridge. Portaged around or through rapids 2-4 times each day whether we went up or down stream. Graduated to an abandoned cabin 6 miles down the road after a couple of years in the gravel pit and drove back and forth each day. Did this for quite a few years. Caught some nice pike in that area and an occasional lake trout or whitefish. Never any walleye. Those trips were a hoot (and a lot of work) but as we got older we decided it was time to stay in cabins. Been renting cabins for maybe 13 years now at various places north of the Soo. Also doing a couple trips a year now. Went up by Nakina last year and again this year. Have not missed a year since my 1st trip. My buddy missed 1 year to get married."

3407890,Guest,2014-12-30 23:55:00,0,HI. as early as I can remember my folks would take us 3 kids for a week of fishing on lake of the woods. probably around 1955. back then we did not even have an outboard engine to use. my older brother would row the boat. I remember we never had much luck. the line always broke. I think it was that we used the same line year after year. when me and my family started going to Canada around 1975 we changed the line every year and still do. now that I am retired in Henderson Nevada we will be going up there for a couple weeks as long as we can.

We fished, bathed & drank the same water from the lake. The fishing was great, nothing like we had at home. Truly heaven on earth for a kid. I did the family trip yearly until I graduated HS, missed the years I was in the Navy. Took my now wife & son up the year before we got married. They were both hooked after the first trip. My son took my granddaughter up for the first time when she was 2, so it sis still a family affair."

Our guide (my friends cousin) showed us where to fish  we all loaded into 3 boats and raced towards the mouth of a creek  our boat had a bigger motor and we arrived about 10 min ahead of the other 2 boats  by the time they arrived we had 3 fish in the boat already  we ended up with our limit and we were back at the camp site by noon.Then it started to snow  which lasted the rest of the weekend ..I wouldn't trade that experience for anything  such great memories  we have lost a few guys in our group to cancer but they are still there in memory and we have a drink to them every year.135 Days to Go .
3408570,LOW1,2014-12-31 08:46:00,2828,"I am always amazed at the number of people in the area we go who trace their attachment to the area to visiting or travelling with a family member who first came there in the 1920s to 1960s. It seems like once you go, you want to go back. We have a short old home movie which was taken probably in the late 1930s of wife's grandparents going to the area. It must have been the first year or two after Highway 71 was opened. I can't say that we are there because of these grandparents because we did not find the movie or know about their trip until after their deaths, but I have vague memories of going there with my parents in the late 1960s. Consider this and perhaps take a kid or two or three with you on your next trip. We encourage our kids to do so and it has been fun for them and us."

The summer before I turned 16, 1969, my Dad sent me alone with a group to Back Bear Lodge on Red Lake. That trip I recall fighting a bigger pike as a boat ""partner"" was snagged and the boat was blowing us away from his snag in a good chop. He insisted I help him and I concentrated on my fish as he hoisted a paddle with his free hand and swung it repeatedly at my head. I bobbed and weaved and fought my fish. Lost the fish. Eventually I tried of being bullied and called him out back at camp. Word spread a circle formed and we entered for the showdown, he backed down. I joined up with a buddy's group and fished the English River in 1989. Some years later I found a different group but have not missed a year in 25. My middle son now 30 joined me the summer before he turned 16 and has not missed a trip since. I fish all over but that week in June is the best. Oh Canada!"
