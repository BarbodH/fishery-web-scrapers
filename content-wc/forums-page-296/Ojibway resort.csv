3473626,NARDA 1,2015-01-24 08:03:00,636,Eagle Lake has become a great fishery and gets better every year in my opinion. I've been going to Birch Dale Lodge www.birchdalelodge.com for 26 years and have noticed the difference the slot limits have made on the lake. I don't believe Ojibway is in business any longer either.
