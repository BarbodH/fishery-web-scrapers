3479802,v-bay gord,2015-01-26 07:27:00,3168,"WC has strict rules about self promotion, so obviously this is completely above board. It is all true. Congratulations to Medicine Stone Resort for generating 8 new members for WC. I look forward to lively posts from them in the future!"

For it really is a place ...... As Good As It Gets."
3481714,SinOrSwim,2015-01-26 15:49:00,1528,"Not disappointed. Just curious responses all from newly registered people that all read like a brochure. CAlling it like I see it, that is all. No offense intended."
553474,Guest,2005-12-24 15:26:00,0,Has anybody ever stayed at Medicine Stone Resort near Red Lake? Wondering about the accomodations and the quality of walleye fishing at their base camp on Upper Medicine Stone Lake. Are they the only resort on this system? Also wondering the same about their outpost on Hy-Vee Lake. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
553530,Guest,2005-12-29 18:10:00,0,Anybody know anything about this lake and/or outfitter? I could really use the help. Thanks!
553531,Hump,2005-12-29 18:59:00,578,"I stayed there 18 years ago. I think it was the first year they had the camp, so my info is ancient.Looking at their web site, it looks like an entirely different camp. Bill Parnek or something like that owns it. We had a horrible trip, but like I said, that was years ago."
553540,WillieB,2005-12-30 14:02:00,292,"Do a search on ""Jubilee Outposts"". Did a nine day trip at Kitty Hawk in 2002, would certainly look at going with them again. I believe it has changed hands in the last year or two...no current experience with the new owners."
553544,Guest,2005-12-30 18:09:00,0,"Thanks for the help! Anyone stayed at the main camp, or at Hy-Vee outpost in recent years?"
561604,Mr. Walleye,2006-10-14 10:53:00,74,Anybody been here in 2006? A report on the facilities and fishing would be appreciated. I'm especially interested in the main camp on Medicine Stone and their Hy-Vee Lake Outpost. Thanks!

Over the years I have found the fishing to be excellent on the lake and Dennis has done a great job making sure you find the walleyes. The boats at the resort real nice with quality depth finder to make the fishing experience better. Dennis takes pride in his camp and expects his guests to do the same. I have been fishing in Canada for nearly 30 years and Medicine Stone Resort is the best place I have came across yet to date.
3447658,dmuthig,2015-01-15 12:27:00,1,"The owners are Dennis and Debbie LeBlanc. First class people and a great resort. The only place on the lake. The fishing is first class for walleye, northern pike and lake trout, I've yet to be disappointed. Guys that have been with us for the first time always comment that it was the best trip they have ever been on. This is a drive to fly in atmosphere. I've been to many places and this is the best I've been to. Dennis is more than willing to put you on fish at any time. This is a very affordable place with no hidden fees and I would highly recommend it."
3449065,BigBadBuck,2015-01-16 07:11:00,1,"Three of us stayed at Medicine Stone Resort in June 2014. Had good fishing for walleye, northerns, and lake trout. Top of the line boats, motors, and depth finders. Dennis and Debbie are great hosts. Never been to Hy-vee, but we did a week long fly-in to Kitty Hawk in 2011. Had great fishing for walleye, northerns, and lake trout. Hy-vee is only couple miles away from Kitty Hawk so I would imagine the fishing would be similar except I don't think there are any lake trout there. Give it a try; you won't be disappointed."
3476370,thomasg333,2015-01-25 07:10:00,2,"My family has been fishing at Medicine-Stone Resort for over a decade. Fishing is fantastic and accommodations are just right for a break away from the busy world.The boats, motors and other equipment are well kept and high end which makes for a quality outing. The owners are great people and the lake is beautiful, providing many unique experiences and settings. If you don't mind a little hike, there are also several smaller lakes available to explore off the main lake.Bottom-line, if you come once, you'll be hooked to come every year after... Cheers!"
