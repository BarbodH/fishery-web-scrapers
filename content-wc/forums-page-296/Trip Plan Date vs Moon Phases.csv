3434226,Mike Borger,2015-01-10 15:16:00,1554,When it comes to big pike I always try and choose a week where the moon is full. Based on my completely unscientific observations it makes a very big difference.Will try and choose the full moon week for my summer family trips as well simply because the full moon is so nice.
3469410,Rock Hound,2015-01-22 20:17:00,51,"I don't plan a trip around moon phase. I plan around the time of year (June for Canada) as well as when I can go (and when buddies can go). I do believe in moon phase, but it isn't the factor of my trip. I would go in June rather than August for example rather than look at moon phase. That is how I plan my trip to Canada. I think that is probably true for most, because the camps busy times are ALWAYS the same weeks of the season year after year. That said, I do believe there is something to solunar tables, barometric pressure, storm fronts, etc. But when is comes to planning my trip, I go when I can go. I think I could convince myself almost any day would be a good day to fish. Moon phase, incoming front, outgoing front, stable weather, rain, west wind, etc. I just love to fish. I wish I could drill a hole in my living room floor right now and fish while watching TV! I too will be looking at the solunar tables for the week of my trip, and for the most part I think those days have been good days on past trips. I just pray for 2 consecutive days (or more) of the same wind (or stable weather during my week) . . . if we get that, we will have some GREAT days. Good luck!"
3469986,Mike Borger,2015-01-23 04:54:00,1554,"But...you do know there's a full moon every month, right? I think you're right though it doesn't factor into most peoples decisions."
3470186,maddogg,2015-01-23 07:03:00,178,If everyone fishes when the moon is full it's no wonder no fish are caught at any other time.
3470642,Mike Borger,2015-01-23 09:19:00,1554,"It goes without saying you're going to catch fish all the time. As usual I have a lot of trips on tap for this year, and no I'm typically not planning them around the moon phase. It's simply not possible. Will I still catch fish? Uh....yeah.However if I'm only doing one trip a year then yeah, I'm making sure it's the perfect week.For that matter any time I actually have a choice I'm choosing the week with the full moon. I've been keeping records, and 3 days before and 3 days after a full moon is prime time for larger pike. More are caught bottom line."
2828513,The Donger,2014-05-23 18:20:00,48,"I make light because we all tend to over-analyze, over-stress and over-spend in our never ending quest for the latest and greatest in technology to catch more fish and/or bigger fish. Frankly we all pay too much attention to all this extraneous stuff when the real joy in fishing lies in spending a day on the water, with a good friend enjoying beautiful surroundings, good conversation and a cup of hot coffee. Our Fathers, Grandfathers and many generations before them caught all the fish they ever needed without all this stuff and probably enjoyed the experience more than we ever will. My final point stands. Forget all this other stuff. Find a lure you like, tie it on the end your line an throw the darn thing in the water. You will probably catch something."
2828521,The Donger,2014-05-23 18:25:00,48,"Holy Cow, Breezy Point. Seriously? Post partum refers to the period after a woman has a baby. In case you didn't notice the entire post was a joke! Have a bad day at work Buddy?"
2828561,BreezyPoint,2014-05-23 18:48:00,1581,"Ok, I apologize, I do know what post partum is, and I am easily led on. Must be my old age.Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk HD"
2828569,BreezyPoint,2014-05-23 18:52:00,1581,"And as I said earlier, even with this knowledge, it never influences my fishing dates. I go when I can and just fish. At least as far as muskies go, I do just as well as the analyzers. You can make up the moon phase difference by fishing smarter. This also includes fishing lower pressured water right in front of the lodge while everyone else is burning time and gas.Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk HD"
2828697,pjshorthorn,2014-05-23 19:56:00,5654,"It appears you may have missed the point of the question from the OP. It also appears you missed the fact that some folks may be interested in lunar phases and how that can affect fishing. Somehow most every publication ,whether it be fishing or weather related; internet based, magazine, nightly newscast or daily newspaper......provides an update on daily or monthly lunar phases and the best times to try and catch fish if a person is interested. Geez, Ding-Donger, I'm sure you cast away on your own schedule. I sure do. I also think that a lot of others folks do as well , but sometimes others will ask for some information that may help themselves; while others benefit from reading the responses. Somehow an honest question from the OP went from; good info provided by other posters that may help, to...... a ""tongue in cheek "" response by yourself that included post partum separation and a bad day at work???? Really ? Have a great Memorial weekend. PjShorthorn"
2828993,Nimstug,2014-05-23 22:14:00,2605,"Reality for me is the moon phase not a concern when planning a big trip. Too much to coordinate with my schedule, wife's schedule, son's schedule (usually my partner for Canada trips), etc. I kind of hope there is not a full moon because I enjoy looking at all the stars, but what it is is what it is. Nimstug...I've done more planning around meteor showers than moon phase."
2829105,Pooch,2014-05-24 04:29:00,4619,"I'm not sure that the moon phase has ever been good or bad for me. I've had fantastic trips in a full moon and dark of the moon with everything in between. Given a choice? I'd take the full moon just to be able to watch the giant moon come up over the tree line.It is so pretty to be running a remote Canadian lake on a full moon, flat as a pancake water with only the swish of water under the boat and the sounds of the old Hamms Beer music in your head. (If you are old enough to remember the Hamms Beer ads)My thoughts are that moon up seems have some effect. If you are on a hot bite, take a look around and see if you can see the moon during the day.Like Nimstug eluded to, work schedule dictates when fishing happens.Go fishing just for the pure and simple pleasure it brings whenever you can 'cause any minute now it could be all over for any of us.Pooch"
2829169,octanehi5,2014-05-24 05:14:00,1104,"I like to plan my trips in what I call prime time,On the lake I fish its the last week in June or the first week in July. The bite has been better under a waning moon to the new moon, Weather still has alot to do with it. Last yrs trip was First week in July with a waning moon,Our guys set some personal bests, this yrs trip is the last week in June with a waning moon,added to a late ice out like last yr.We like our star gazing at night.I do have to say that on some yrs its awsome watching the full moon come up, Then again a bad day of fishing does not exist,If it was easy they would call it Catching not Fishing"
2829257,ohiojmj,2014-05-24 05:53:00,1262,"Some moon in the sky is best for my evening trolls, but sometimes I adjust my fishing schedule to coordinate with my wife's mood ring colors."
3434210,Ebarnett,2015-01-10 15:08:00,60,"The moon phase does not factor in so much as getting the guys schedules to work. But i always check the moon phase calendar. I love Astronomy, and love looking up into the pitch black Canadian night sky completely devoid of light pollution. The new moon is the best time for this. Most places in the US we dont get to see the beauty of the Milky Way Cloud."
2827657,Freytown,2014-05-23 11:45:00,770,"Anyone look at the moon phase calendar when picking a week??? I don't and feel weather conditions play a much bigger role/effect than the moon phases. So let's hear your opinion. BTW, my week has too good days shown...I'll pay attention and report back."
2827697,BreezyPoint,2014-05-23 12:36:00,1581,"I never pay attention to moon phases but I do have data on the moon phase at capture for over 12000 muskies. That data shows a slight edge to the new moon over the full moon. The other two quarters lag a bit. The actual graph of that data can be seen here:http://www.redwinglodge.net/wp-conte...Moon-Phase.pdfIt does look as though there is some influence by moon phase, but it is hard to sort out because no one knows how many fishermen fished each of those phases."
2827737,Hot Runr Guy,2014-05-23 12:49:00,16061,"Being that I like to stay out after sunset, I sure do like a full moon for heading back to the dock. HRG"
2827841,adempsey,2014-05-23 13:29:00,963,"That graph is quite interesting. Would be nice to have some additional variables, such as season/month as well. You can probably assume the number of anglers (and techniques) is similar across the phases given the number of fish, but that data would still be useful."
2827929,BreezyPoint,2014-05-23 14:06:00,1581,I wrote the program that produces the graphs. I will look into seeing if I can do a simple query to further refine the data. I am not sure if I can do it because I am retired now and don't have access to the development tools I used.Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk HD
2827977,BreezyPoint,2014-05-23 14:10:00,1581,I can say with certainty that the average size fishes increases considerably each month until the end of the season. If people are interested I will post some of that data as well.Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk HD
2828209,Freytown,2014-05-23 15:46:00,770,"BP, that graph is awesome. And I'd say similar results would be seen for other fish species too. I guess the fish feed when their hungry...maybe a bit more under certain moon phases. Thxs for posting."
2828417,The Donger,2014-05-23 17:42:00,48,"I have performed over 700 multi-phase, post-partum regression analysis on this type of data and have found no correlation between moon phases, moon dances, or moon pies vs. the walleye bite, or the northern bite or the muskies biting any of those other guys. I have had this data reviewed at Harvard, Oxford, MIT, and at a corner tavern in Edgar, WI. My findings were validated by all parties except that guy that had too many brandies and pickled eggs in Edgar. Guy was clearly not a scholar like me. I even sent my trusted lab assistant, Beaker, to work with a headhunter tribe in Borneo to test this theory on their native fish species. Unfortunately I was unable to corroborate the data in Borneo because Beaker never returned. Guess I shouldn't have put that bottle of A1 Steak Sauce in his backpack before he left. Based on my exhaustive studies my best advice is to find the lure you like best, tie it on the end of your line and throw the darn thing in the water. I'll bet you catch something."
2828425,BreezyPoint,2014-05-23 17:44:00,1581,"Ok, since you are such a great scholar, how do you explain the results above? These are hard accurate numbers on data collected since 1987.Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk HD"
2828465,BreezyPoint,2014-05-23 18:03:00,1581,"Also can you please explain the term 'post partum' regression analysis. I have heard of several types of regression analysis, I.e., linear, quadratic, Bayesian, etc. but never post partum. I have to call you on this because I think you are blowing smoke.Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk HD"
