That being said, and I hate to bring it up but not all resorts require USD. The bottom line though, is if you thought it was a fair price when you booked (US or Cdn)...it is still a fair price. Who knows what the summer will bring...."

3494666,Andre (wallyandre),2015-01-30 15:52:00,2274,"When I travel in the States I pay in $US, in France it's in Euro.In Quebec I'm not aware that outfitters are asking to be paid in $US.By the way the Canadian loonie today is: 78.50"
3494682,rzep,2015-01-30 16:00:00,1196,"Have not booked anything. From personnal experience,all the secondary expenses are negiligent comparing to ""package"" resort price. Hence savings are small. Would like to see list of ones taking CAN."

3494778,Andre (wallyandre),2015-01-30 16:59:00,2274,It's not all the outfitters that are member of the Federation of Outfitters. but I just took a look on a few and I didn't see one that is charging in $UShttp://www.pourvoiries.com/en/

3498474,zeebee,2015-02-01 11:12:00,1144,For those really looking to save $ on your trip north........... pack your vehicle full of fondue sets. There is a dire need for them in Canada and they sell for 10x their US cost.
3488914,Andre (wallyandre),2015-01-28 17:50:00,2274,"From the Bank Of canada:http://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/exc...utmk=258657546 Good time for a US citizen to buy a Princecraft boat or a Kingfisher. Boat deliver to the US with no tax! Lot of money to save. For my part, I do have a camp on Lake Champlain so everything will cost me +20% at least."
3490074,Algoma Guy,2015-01-29 06:36:00,48,Well that settles it!!! Everybody should take a trip Canada this year!

3490234,port1042,2015-01-29 07:27:00,509,Earlier this week I renewed my Outdoors Card and bought my annual Sportsman's License. Total cost (including service fee) was $97.47CAN. My credit card charge was $79.17. I have no foreign transaction fees on my card (Capital One).
3490266,LOW1,2015-01-29 07:36:00,2828,The price of gas dropping and the drop in the Loonie means that the cost in $USD to buy gas in Canada has dropped by about 50% from its peak.

3490354,rzep,2015-01-29 07:55:00,1196,How is it good time to take a trip to CAN if most resorts require USD as payment ?
3490402,Obabikon,2015-01-29 08:06:00,2370,"Cheaper fuel costs (will save you money), 99% of resorts haven't raised their prices (because of the good exchange rate), and it will help a struggling Canadian economy. I could come up with a bunch more... but those three seem the most important. Even paying in US, it should be a cheaper trip than last year. Anytime that something is cheaper an entire year later, that's a good thing."
