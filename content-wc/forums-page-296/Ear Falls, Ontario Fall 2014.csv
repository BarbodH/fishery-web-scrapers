3228121,SteveZ,2014-10-07 17:29:00,271,"We got back Saturday from a wonderful trip on the English River below Lac Suel. We averaged about 100 fish per day per boat. We had lots of 20-25"" eyes with the big fish being 28. Nice fat gold walleyes. We also caught whitefish, smallies, perch, saugers, northerns, and some big brown suckers. The weather was decent, we had one day where it rained all day, but other than that it was not bad. Can't wait to head back up in the spring."

3228761,SteveZ,2014-10-08 05:02:00,271,"We fished right below the dam clear to MK Camp where the English meets the Chukuni. We key on current breaks, points, and rock humps in the river. We did very well on dragging cranks upstream, drifting jigs and plastics, as well as pitching plastics."
3229393,Mike Kansas,2014-10-08 09:51:00,1463,Glad to hear you had a great trip. We have fished there in the fall many times. Always had great luck when the generators were on and the water was moving. Great area also because you are out of the wind and are usally close to camp if you stay right below the falls. Mike Kansas
3229409,SteveZ,2014-10-08 09:56:00,271,All of the gates were closed and the water coming through was all through the power houses. Good current and lots of fish. You are right about the getting out of the wind up there.
3473034,brieye,2015-01-24 04:15:00,4,Have any of you fished this same area in June? Thanks for the information. I will be staying at JR's Portage Bay below the dam first time this year.
