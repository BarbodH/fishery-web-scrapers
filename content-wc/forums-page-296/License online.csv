3462362,bigdaddyguns,2015-01-20 21:45:00,608,Bought our licenses on-line the last three years. Here is the link:https://www1.on.wildlifelicense.com/custlkup.php?lang=

3462978,Carnhzkr,2015-01-21 07:44:00,964,"I've done it before. It's pretty straight forward. You'll need to enter your card number and print out your license on standard paper. I believe they charge a buck or two extra for that. Probably no biggie, but one small thing to consider is you'll now have a 8.5 X 11 inch license to keep with you and keep dry (maybe you don't need the full sheet of paper, I don't recall). I prefer the small license I get when I purchase in Ontario so I can keep it tucked into the license pouch along with my other licenses in my wallet, but it's certainly easy and convenient to buy online."

3466330,SinOrSwim,2015-01-22 06:37:00,1528,"Saves a TON of time to do it on-line. We usually have a relatively large group. 6 to 14 people. Doing licenses was always a pain because it took so long. I think last year may have been the first year everyone did it on-line before we went. No long stop at a bait shop to get a license done.As for dry. Mine goes in my camera bag which is always in my dry bag. Or, put it in a ziplock bag and stick it in your tackle box."
3467242,BornToFish,2015-01-22 10:28:00,1224,"It so happens that I was on-line this morning and purchased my Ontario Outdoor Card and Fishing License, as both expired at the end of 2014. For the first time, I purchased a 3-year Sports Fishing License. I did this for three reasons: 1) avoid future price increases in the fishing license, 2) avoid future service fees (pay only once, and not three times), and 3) take advantage of the favorable exchange rate. I spoke to a lady at the 1-800 number to clarify another issue. She told me that the back of my Outdoor Card should have some language indicating that my Fishing License runs concurrent with my Outdoor Card. Thus, I need to only carry with me my Outdoor Card and not a paper copy of my Fishing License. Good Fishing and Tight Lines!!"

3471858,port1042,2015-01-23 16:06:00,509,"Thanks for the tip of using the exchange rate to save a few bucks. My lodge quotes in US dollars and we buy our gas in the US so I didn't expect to save much. However, this morning I renewed my Outdoors Card and bought my annual Sportsman's license. Total bill (including ""service fees"" was $97.47CAD. Total charge on my credit card -- $79.17 and no foreign transaction fee!"
