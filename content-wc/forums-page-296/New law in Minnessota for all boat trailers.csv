3499666,Powerstroke Diesel,2015-02-01 19:23:00,45,We always debate about the route we take......MN has made it easy for us......We'll stay in North Dakota and cross via I-29.
3424186,Gipper,2015-01-06 13:08:00,76,"I'm sadly amused by those that don't see this as another example of how the country is changing for the worse, but instead is, maybe, an ""opportunity"" to learn something. When free men actually don't mind putting up with this stuff, or are incapable of seeing when they are being hosed, we've truly lost it. I think we've finally got the government we deserve. Too bad the youngsters will never know what it was really like. Some probably wonder why I'm too cheap to pay $5. Cancelled MN fishing trips is the message to send. The resort owners will carry the water."
3425306,Gipper,2015-01-06 20:29:00,76,"This is the thinking that IS the problem. People talk about concerns about the fee going up in time. People talk about how they are a little troubled by the law as it affects people who are merely traveling through the state. And so on. Some will never mind being directed by a government who they think knows better. But no one seems bothered by an enormous overreach by an out-of-control state government. No one mentions how their freedoms are affected by some state employee whose JOB is to look to the government for solutions to every problem. Why not look for alternatives. Why not look to Wisconsin, or other states, with an aggressive educational program to combat the problem we all agree is important. Slight government assist, yes, but by the people and fisherman. Oh, by the way, I'd like to see a measure of the success of this law. It will never happen folks. Wake up, MN."
3425866,h8go4s,2015-01-07 07:37:00,1673,"The Minnesota law was enacted because compliance with existing laws was measured at less than 20%, as I recall. I could be off on that number, but it was significant. In spite of signage at boat ramps, TV infomercials, newspaper articles, etc., people claimed to be unaware of invasive species transfer prevention methods when inspected at boat ramps. The new law is exactly what you are advocating. It is an ""aggressive"" educational program, just as you suggest. You must take an online or mail-in course to qualify for the trailer sticker. The sticker is your diploma, it's not just a sticker you're buying. It's confirmation that you understand the problem and will comply with the rules and regulations. As far as measuring the success, I know our DNR has been measuring and publicizing the success of current AIS prevention efforts and I'm confident they will continue to do so. What is Wisconsin doing (with what you describe as ""slight government assist"") that is different from Minnesota's efforts, and is the success of that effort measured and publicized?"
3426234,Lmbkiller,2015-01-07 09:41:00,639,"Still, shouldn't matter for people not using MN waters and just passing thru. This part seems to be lost on every one. Not launching boat in MN=no reason I should need a sticker"
3426386,dutchboy,2015-01-07 10:33:00,5717,"So, what if you DO launch in Minnesota without a sticker? What kind of fine would you be willing to pay? $2,000? The state should take your word that you won't launch, that you are just traveling through but how are they to know you won't lie to them? The point is that this law is useless. They are attempting to make the sportsman pay for a program of education that wasn't a part of the initial problem. These things were transported in by barge, cargo ship, out of state boats, birds, turtles, Martins, and global warming. So now it's upon the sportsman to pay the piper? When seat belt use was mandated the percentage of users was very, very low. Did they start writing tickets? No. they ran commercials, used billboards, had officers on TV all at ZERO costs to motorists and certainly nothing to those passing through. Funding came from the gas tax, sales tax, general fund taxes. Taxes that citizens already paid. Now if the state & DNR want to educate boaters about AIS pull the funding from the state general fund. Let the state fund this. That way EVERYBODY pays not just the guys who fish or boat. Last I checked I haven't collected a nickle for welfare, yet I pay into the fund everyday of my life. The future price is the lost revenue from license and registration fee's as people just get tired of the BS."
3427946,Gipper,2015-01-07 21:40:00,76,"If you think about it, the 20% number is a pipe dream. There is no way anyone can stand to that number in front of a group of wise folks with out being laughed off the stage. But if your are thoughtful and know folks that are into the sport, as I do, you will understand that we take this stuff seriously.....we actually do the stuff required to prevent spread of invasive species...as futile as that might be. Everyone I know in Wisconsin is in tune and compliant no matter how they feel about the overall success. They do what is needed by their own sense of personal responsibility. To have the government fine you if you don't have sticker is insulting and an indication of the MDNR failure to do the job they are paid to do. You ask what is the success rate in Wisconsin? Among ALL the folks I know.....100% compliance!!! No govt mandate."
3430978,nicko,2015-01-09 05:23:00,508,"Just another way to collect some additional revenue. WI has a very extensive program they put into place last year. Volunteers at every major lake and boat ramp handing out materials and surveying people. At no cost, all volunteer. Like someone said before, most of this problem exists due to other issues like the big international cargo haulers. The problem with government is that they seem to think they can legislate common sense. You can't. I'd love to see what the money is being used for. Cleanup? Funding the program? What? AIS is a big problem in many states, almost impossible to stop even with programs like this. You can slow it, but you always have a few morons who feel they don't need to play by the rules. Time will tell if it has any legs at all.... N"
3431338,Oldicecoach,2015-01-09 08:12:00,15,"This law should be enforced similar to a boat launch fee, if you are at the boat landing you need to possess the trailer sticker.Definitely and overreach by the State of Minnesota."

3416826,CKM,2015-01-03 12:57:00,3836,I would bet my next paycheck that never happens. And that would never hold up in court anyway so it's a mute point
3416858,pjshorthorn,2015-01-03 13:42:00,5654,"Looks like good campfire discussion material during time spent in Canada this year. I'll be especially interested to hear how enforceable it is regardlesss of any date. I also find it interesting that folks would actualy spend more money driving further routes to avoid a nominal sticker fee and a few minutes of time taking a course. Then again, I guess folks take longer routes to avoid paying tolls on highways. Too each there own I 'd rather spend the extra time fishing than traveling. PjShorthorn"
3417122,CKM,2015-01-03 16:08:00,3836,"it's strictly about principal. if MN thinks a five dollar sticker is going to solve their ANS problems they're dumber than a stump. It's nothing but a revenue generating program. It will morph into a 20 dollar sticker then more. The commerce clause of the constitution will render this useless in regards to getting non residents to pay for a sticker to travel through the state. As it should. There are alot of float planes that run around northern MN. haven't heard about their sticker. Or the stickers for the turtles, birds, etc. everyone has to pay to play"
3417602,pjshorthorn,2015-01-03 19:40:00,5654,"I think your first sentence speaks volumes. As I mentioned, to each their own.I don't have a boat in this huntbut I do have a few thoughts. I do think that it is disappointing that a large consensus see this as a ""money grab"" vs. what most likely is intended to be a program to raise awareness regarding a problem that will grow if something different isn't done. I'm not sure that the proposed program in MN was a short term solution intended to solve a significant biological issue quickly. I have no interest in where the money goes eventually within the state of MN;which is no different than myself having no interest in where the money for my Ontario Outdoors Card eventually ends up. That is the administration's job to manage the funds and the proper use of the funds in order to support the program in the manner intended. If the management of the program funds is not being handled well, then I say burn the dumb stumps in the campfire this fishing season and find some smarter/sturdier stumps. I think it is a little too early to make that call.What I do believe is that if AIS is an eventual problem in MN or other states and nothing is done to change the inevitable, then the outcome is far worse than a few dollars out of one's pocket each year. The end result is that we will have saved a few bucks personally, spent those bucks on one or two new lures per year and we along with future generations will eventually have a limited fishing resource that will cost even more to preserve due to lack of change or the desire to support environmental programs early on.Mother Nature is a very strong entity and can heal some pretty significant wounds when necessary, but she can't do it all on her own. It takes education and willingness as well. If it takes a 20 dollar sticker in the future, so be it. That is a small price to pay and one any boat owner can afford to pay just like each person fishingin Canada can afford to pay for the Outdoors card fee or an increase in license, bait, fuel or lodging fees.I recall when the walleye limits on Lac Seul were reduced from 6 to 4 with a slot instituted as well. No one liked it. Today the fishery is healthier than ever with more fish for future generations that seem to get stronger every year. I don't hear anyone complaining about catching 1000+ fish in a week with many 28"" - 30""+ fish.I recall moving to the Cleveland /Akron area in 1975 and hearing about what a dead lake Erie was after the Cuyahoga River caught on fire. Look at it now....a premier fishery in spite of offensive pollution and invasive species. That didn't happen by everyone turning their head and ignoring the fact that change needed to take place. I don't hear many complaints about fishing on Lake Erie today unless their trip got blown off the lake.Here is my personal position. If I had to pay a $5 fee when driving through MN ( boat or no boat, bird or no bird, turtle or no turtle) to support AIS awareness and any behaviors that would hopefully change the current trend, I'm all in. I would demand a sticker and fly it with honor on the window of my truck just like I did with Trout Unlimited when I lived in PA and the Coastal Conservation Association when living in Texas. Now that I'm done with that .What are the options/solutions for an effective program in MN or any other state for that matter? I recognize that every state and body of water would have different variables to contend with, but mostly all I've read about on this subject over the last 8-10 months are why things will not work.PjShorthorn"
3417810,Lmbkiller,2015-01-03 22:48:00,639,"I'm curious.....where does it state that the AIS sticker is $5? In all my research all I can find is that the mndnr will come out with the cost of sticker in jan/feb. Its only jan 3, did I miss something? If it is only $5 then that totally explains the ""money grab"" concept, which I'm not ok with. MN figures if we only charge $5 then everyone will pay it because its only $5. To me, if they are making such a massive deal about AIS and they want to prevent spread and its truly important to the state, then it should cost way more than $5. The sticker and processing alone is way more than $5. A solution to them wanting and getting more money is simply charging a ""trailer toll"", which I would have no problem paying $5 for. In this day in age people aren't as naive and unaware as they used to be so I say to states if u want more money, just ask for it, don't try to ""pull the wool"" over people's eyes any more. They just don't buy it any more"
3418146,jimirjr,2015-01-04 07:11:00,1149,"Geez guys.... WYOMING makes ALL out of state boaters purchse a $30 ANS sticker.... Then They ""rarely' check you out for the sticker... BUT... you must have it. $5 for residents.... Talk about a RIPOFF....."
3418402,Lmbkiller,2015-01-04 09:19:00,639,"The big difference here jimr is that the MNdnr is trying to require people that are just ""passing through"" with boats to have a sticker. I'm not not launching my boat in MN, why should I need a sticker to pull it down the road?"
3419890,@Lunker,2015-01-04 18:23:00,835,"I commend pj for his well stated, altruistic viewpoint. However, I'm of the ""it's the principle of the thing"" viewpoint. If the sticker vs a fine is required of those of us just passing through, how long will it be before I'm required to display 50 different license plates on my vehicle to travel from point A to point B? On the other hand, why not make it a universal program and split the revenue, if there is any, among the states of residence of the boat owners?"

3402137,Minnow Man,2014-12-29 09:38:00,85,"Just read this on a post from Golden Hook Camp in Ontario Canada. Golden Hook Camp Hi everybody, I hate to be a bearer of bad news but please see this website: http://trailers.mndnr.gov/ The State of Minnesota has acclaimed a new law requiring ANYONE (not just residents of the State of Minnesota) to have this new sticker on their boat trailer if you are driving it through the State and even if you are not going to fish Minnesota waters. The scary part is you have to take a test and pay a fee to get the sticker and the law comes into effect next July. So if you are from Iowa and you are going to a fishing lodge in Ontario and you plan to cross at a border between Minnesota and Ontario then you need this sticker since you will be towing your boat through Minnesota even if you don't plan to fish there! This could have a major impact on people travelling to Canada as I am sure the cops in MN will be stopping everyone once the law comes in to effect. Thanks to Jody at Crystal Beach Resort for sending this to me. Since it is a State law, not sure there is anything we can do up here in Ontario about it - but I think it is going to cause a lot of headaches for your guests if they bring their own boat with them. Will check into this at the All Canada shows and keep in touch with everyone the link was sent to me. Hope everyone has a Happy New Year!

3404314,Lmbkiller,2014-12-29 20:19:00,639,"New to wc but have lurked for sometime. Anyways, been reading into this new ""law"". My thoughts are that the part of this requirement requiring people just ""passing through"" are ultimately not going to be required to have sticker. There are loopholes in the language already and the way I read it they are forgetting a portion of mn water resource users. Are ice shacks being towed required to purchase this? What about float planes? Did the birds that migrate through mn get the memo? I don't think birds have literacy capabilities or money for that matter. It is ridiculous to think one should have to get this when not even using mn waters. A complete money grab that in the end won't work for people simply passing through. MN..good try though"
