My understanding is he bankrupted that company leaving a lot of winners without a check.It appears to be a lot more creative with this scheme.They seem to advertise himself ,his family as members. And winners that don't exist.Heh Canadian tire and Chevy got out of the world cup of fishing years ago because of his practises! Just wondering if this is another scam?"
