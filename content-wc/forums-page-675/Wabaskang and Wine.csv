Walleyes were not as plentiful as in early summer, but a higher % of large ones. I probably didn't put much effert into it either, it was a pretty layed back week. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"

561670,Trailerguy,2006-10-19 21:24:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]It depends on the water level. When it's low they portage into Wine, when it's high you can boat through the slot, but consult somebody who does it regularly, there's a huge rock on one side, and I don't remember off hand which side it's on. Wine Lake Camp has a flat bottum with a 115 Yammy, they are the most knowledgeable about the conditions at any given time. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"

560577,AB,2006-08-22 21:26:00,61,"The walleye bite was good for our two week Wabaskang stay 7/29 - 8/12. Maybe one of the best I've had for numbers. Even when Pike fishing couldn't keep the eyes off the line. Usually it's the other way around. We fish all over and they were in the 17-24 ft range off the weed lines. We also go deeper for larger fish in the big lake and caught eyes as deep as 35ft. Lots of slot sized pike but none in the 40's. Smallmouth fishing was tough, when we found them, as they seemed to be suspended with their mouths closed. Perch fishing as good as normal. We always make one trip into Wine. Mainly for the scenery. The day we went was a hot bluebird day and the bite was nothing to brag about. Several camp boats moving around us that day so the bite must've been tough for all."

561257,Fred_G,2006-09-19 20:42:00,908,"I spent last week on Wabaskang. The water level is about three feet low. I found most of the fish had moved out to the 25 - 35 ft level. A spinner rig with a minnow worked the best, however some others in camp were having good success on jig/minnow combos. The area around Devils Point and the north shore of the big lake were my most productive. I heard of several fish caught around Doe Island too. Hope this helps."
561357,Guest,2006-09-23 15:57:00,0,"I just returned from Wabaskang. We stayed at Peffley's Camp and fished from Sept. 16-21. Our group of ten fought some of the toughest fishing conditions I've seen in twenty years of fishing the lake. Saturday through Tuesday brought temperatures in the low forties, rain, and steady winds of probably twenty MPH with gusts that probably exceeded forty at times. The wind was primarily out of the southeast and northeast. Wednesday and Thursday the temperature moderated and the wind calmed considerably giving us a couple of beautiful days. As has already been noted, the water level is extremely low. While I'm at it, let me give props to the Tech H2O rain gear from Gander Mountain. My gear is three years old and I stayed completely dry in about as tough of conditions as you'll ever find. It also does a great job of blocking the wind. I'll match it up with Cabela's much more expensive Guide Wear any day of the week. The good news is that our diligence was rewarded with a lot of nice fish. There were lots of eighteen inch-plus fish and I was lucky to catch the biggest walleye of the week at a little over twenty-four inches. Several more in the twenty-one to twenty-four inch range were released. The hottest spots were the north shore, the flats west of Birch Island, the east side of Birch, and the third point south of camp. Almost all were caught on jigs and minnows with a few nice fish taken on Hopkins spoons. One nice surprise was the weeds at the far west end of the lake. We went out there looking for perch and pulled forty walleyes out of eight to ten feet of water in about three hours. The smallmouth fishing was the toughest I've seen in years, no doubt due to the low water level. There was one nineteen-inch fish caught and only a handful of others. We don't really target northern pike, but typically catch several nice ones while fishing for walleye. There was one thirty-one inch northern and the rest of them ran pretty small. Perch fishing was spotty, but we had a few nice messes caught. Thanks to Dave Peffley, Lou, and Helen for another great week in camp. As usual the facilities were flawless, the staff attended to our every need, the boats are in great condition, and you rarely pulled the starter rope more than twice to start the motors. If there is a better value as far as quality of fishing and facilities anywhere in Ontario, you couldn't prove it by me. It's no mystery why that camp runs at over ninety percent capacity year in and year out. I'm already counting down the days to next year."
