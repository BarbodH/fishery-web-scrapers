561692,gpbrown,2006-10-22 19:06:00,359,"joepa, One of our better years, size and numbers. Stayed at cabonga again, lots of 17-19's and two 28+'s. Pike numbers were low again but we go in july which is to be expected. Overall I'd say our best year for walleye in 5-7 years. How'd you guys do this year?? gb"
561694,joepa,2006-10-23 09:24:00,366,"gp, I had heard that the fishing was better this year. One of our guys got pretty sick and we had to cancel our trip. As a result I am thinking about next year already. Did you ever get the chance to fish near Haynes (spelling?) island?"
561703,gpbrown,2006-10-23 21:10:00,359,"joe, give me some idea where Haynes is?? I'll get my maps out and look. We stay at Cabonga so we mainly fish the southern half but I usually take a day and fish different spots. I love to venture out but my prop is not crazy about those excursions. One day two years ago I was up in Cox Bay which is due east of Fog Isle and I hit a rock the size of a small house, thought for sure the lower unit would be at the bottom of the lake but thankfully we were ok...just a little skeg and prop damage. I cartwheeled clear to the front of the boat. I'm always looking for new spots so give me some info. gb"
