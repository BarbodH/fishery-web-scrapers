561471,Larry L,2006-10-01 23:58:00,335,Just keep heading north. Wolloston Lake or Lake Athabaska are hard to beat. Bring money. Or south. Long Lake in the fall is nice too. There are a lot of northerns in Sask. Good luck.

561803,skindzier,2006-11-02 12:34:00,137,"Athabasca - our group (4 of us) caught 15 40"" + pike in 4 days. We also went into a bay that had ""smaller"" ones in the 25"" - 35"" range where you caught them literally every 3rd or fourth case. At one point on that bay I had action on 12 straight casts. The lake trout fishing is also incredible - I caught one in the 40 pound range. We stayed at Blackmur's. Very pricey though - kind of a once in a lifetime thing for most of us..."
