Evenings are best, I know that Moose hunting, duck hunting and building a new cabin is taking up most of the daylight hours. I know the website could be better but when they have as much repeat business and great word of mouth about Blair and Kathy's operation, a website is nothing more than window dressing. If you would like more first hand info email me at [email protected] Steve"
