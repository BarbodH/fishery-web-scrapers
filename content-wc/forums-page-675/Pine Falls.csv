561632,skeeterslim,2006-10-16 19:11:00,14,Anyone know what or where the secret is for Pine Falls this year? Should a guy crank (and with what) or jig (live or frozen)? Also where should a guy try?? I hear the river is very low. Also wondering if anyone was there on the weekend and how they made out. Thanks in advance... Slim ;)

561641,Burr,2006-10-17 10:14:00,8612,"Current at Pine Falls is almost non-existent below the rapids. Current seams by the dam were productive during the voyaguers (sp) derby. You'll have to shoot the rapids to get to the dam as there is no longer an access at the pump house. Water levels appeared lower than what they actually are during the last derby and prefishing. As always - south winds empty the bay and river. The Friday before the derby - yes, the water levels were lower than I had ever seen before. By the following Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday - north winds made everything familiar again. Treaty Rock was completely under water, not something I would have expected the Friday before. I anticipate fishing will be quite a bit different for this weekends derby - the water temp is down about 10 degrees - was 47-48 in the bay when we left last Thursday. The lack of current will still challenge the migration, however - the lowering water temps should help them move in, as well as the bait in the system. If this wind does not take a day or two off (#$%*^## wind!) expect the bay to be a mud bowl. It was last Wednesday, and Thursday had 40 knot winds from the North... Today - again... Opinions differ, however I feel you need to create some vibration when fishing muddy water, so the fish can find your bait. I'd probably spend all my time trolling - if you can get out to the bay (#^%@@$$* wind!). Pulling spinners may also be something to consider. Both live bait and salties worked for us - neither really was better than the other. However, our hands stayed warmer with the salties. Don't sit next to the minnow bucket. It is, and will be, 'ice-makin' cold. Be prepared to deal with it. If the wind doesn't bother ya, look forward to the snow, rain, ice, cold. The weather was the most challenging I have had in the previous 10 years. The forcast says more of the same. We can only hope the weather man is wrong. IMO - maybe November will have a warm spell."

561681,Guest,2006-10-20 21:13:00,0,the lake and the mouth of the river were solid mud as of last saturday. caught fish just north of the access by the paper plant. then caught quite a few right in front of the dam. nothing very big (except a sturgeon ) mostly sauger. only seen one greenback all weekend and it was on the red in selkirk.
