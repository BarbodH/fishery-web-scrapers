561638,DanL,2006-10-17 08:54:00,262,How was the fishing on Minnitaki this year? We did not do very well in 2004 and 2005 so we did not go back this year. We usually stay at Donnelly's. We just thought the lake was not what it was compared to the past eight years that we have been up there. Hopefully it has picked up. We are considering going back in 2007.

This was the best year we have had since we started going in 2002. We have been there in August twice, late May once, and mid-July twice. The main reason we did better is we got better at fishing. Less jigging in the same old spots, more movement to find fish. One big difference I noted this year was a general lack of 16 to 18 inch walleyes. We caught a lot more 12 to 14 inchers than in our first few years. The lake was low this year, about 2 feet lower than in July 2005. I have never heard of anyone on Minnitaki having a day comparable to what others here say is an average day on Lac Seul. There are also noticeably fewer boats on Minnitaki than there were in 2002 or 2003."
