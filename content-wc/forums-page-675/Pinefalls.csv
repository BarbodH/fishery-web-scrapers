561671,Guest,2006-10-20 01:52:00,0,Good luck to all the boys and girls out at Pine falls this firday and saturday. Greens or no greens all those pro's will find some big eyeballs they always do. I'm hoping for the Kevin J.P. combo to combine for the big victory.

Kevin & I didn't do as well as we wanted, super tough fishing, only caught 3 greenbacks each day with a 8 pounder on Day 2. Still a good time though. Weather was BAAAAADDD! I was wearing 3 layers under my floater suit and was STILL cold! It also didn't help that I was the anchor boy and my hands were numb for 1/2 the day, lol. Kevin is a good guy to fish with, had lots of fun. J.P."
561686,Guest,2006-10-22 01:32:00,0,">You can't catch something that's not there. The greenbacks are definetly there. We caught some, not many. I did however see alot of them caught, the biggest being a whopping 12 1/2 pounder. Gotta anchor in that river in 17 - 24 feet and be super patient... maybe even have a nap with the rod in your hand, lol. J.P."
561693,Guest,2006-10-22 21:36:00,0,Sounds like a true test of endurance to bad you guys didn't come out on top. But still even with the cold and waiting for a bite it sounds like you and Kevin enjoyed the tourney. Do you know who won? And a 8 pounder to boot to bad you couldn't find that ones grandma!! How did Tony and All the others do? nothings been posted.

561727,Guest,2006-10-24 21:53:00,0,"To bad about Pine Falls it seems on that body of water your either on them or your not tough fishing, but I dont think thats the norm. Even so JP said a 13 pounder was caught thats a winning walleye in any tourney. Thinking of hitting the Red one last time before I put the boat away mabye sunday.Tourneys are over for another year but I'm looking forward to next year!!!!!"
