561680,Canuck eh,2006-10-20 17:59:00,5,A couple of wks ago it was jigging til noon then cranking but since it has cooled off jigging has been the ticket. Slow and easy with salties.
561689,Guest,2006-10-22 09:25:00,0,"Was on the Red yesterday, Water temps were a steady 40. Anchored on the miracle mile, anywhere from 12 to 16'. Chatreuse jigs and salties were the ticket yesterday. Hauled in a 27"", 27.5"" and a 28.25"" and a million smaller (12-14"" saugers,saugeyes). Was cold...but the weather forecast is looking decent for the upcoming weekend but thats still a week away and it will change 5 times before then. Roger"
561691,Canuck eh,2006-10-22 12:02:00,5,"Yes, Roger it was cool. We were anchored about a mile down river from U and we as well had a ton of small sauger but fortunate enough to boat a 27 and 2 very chunky 25 mixed in with the sauger and smaller eyes. We to sat it out and did OK in my opinion. We did drop one fish that really bent the rod but that is what keeps U coming back. Got a good head cold or would have been out today. I will wait until Tues or Wed. I am sure that 34""er will wait for me. HA HA."
561630,Guest,2006-10-16 16:50:00,0,"I have a little time to head north to fish the Red or Pine falls the last of this month, I haven't been up there that late in the year before was wondering if it would be worth the trip, I am hoping for open water fishing but need some advice on what i should expect. What is the fishing currently like. thanks for your info. HUNG LOW"
561631,Canuck eh,2006-10-16 17:20:00,5,"The greenies in the Red have been outstanding. Personally I have not been out to Pine Falls but the reports I am getting is that the flow is real low and the fishing not that good. On the Red there have been several 10+ greenies picked up and a few 14s. What U should expect is open water but it will be cool, NO COLD. There should be very little boat traffic but I am sure I will be on the water at least a couple of those days."
561642,mrwalleye5,2006-10-17 17:54:00,1922,14 day trend says below normal temps. Most days will not get over 4 celsius. (39degree far) W5
561645,Guest,2006-10-18 11:00:00,0,"The cold doesn't matter as much as the fishing being good, I suppose too cold means Ice, what is the flow like, how is the fishing? Thanks Hung Low"
561649,Guest,2006-10-18 12:19:00,0,"Flow? What Flow? Not this year. In past years, I've been out with a 5/8oz and still had a hard time keeping it straight up and down. Two weeks ago, was using 1/4oz no problem at all. Was out last saturday, and used 3/8 all day. No problem. Caught a zillion saugers and a few greens mixed in. No size on saturday. Still lots of decent sized fish being caught every day. I will be heading to Pine Falls this weekend. Third time this year. Was a complete bust previous two times. They just hadnt shown up at that time. Rumours are that the bay is starting to produce... here and there. Roger"
561654,Guest,2006-10-18 19:53:00,0,red is great whearher is real bad pinefalls sucks
561657,Canuck eh,2006-10-18 21:47:00,5,"Hunglow: Cold on the 28th to the 5th does not mean ice. In fact I do NOT think there will be ice by then in fact I would bet on it. Now if U were talking December then maybe. We were on the ice on the 10th December last year. I say cold because we just are not used to it yet, we had such a nice summer this year. No there really isn't that much flow on the Red but the Greenies are there. There is more flow on the Red than on the Wpg at Pine Falls."
561658,mrwalleye5,2006-10-18 22:53:00,1922,"You're right, we're just not used to it yet. I've stared down a hole in the ice in the winter when it was -50. I'm dressed the same, all in our heads, oh yea and a little in our fingers. W5"
561662,Guest,2006-10-19 13:49:00,0,keep those red reports comming! Appreciate the info! Thanks
561678,Guest,2006-10-20 17:31:00,0,"What have the effective jigging patterns been, colors? amount of jigging required, also has pulling plugs paid off at all?? Thanks HUNG LOW"
