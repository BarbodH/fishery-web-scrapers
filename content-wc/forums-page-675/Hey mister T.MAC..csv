Our fishing was POOR and the weather...well... last I saw you I was sitting in the truck eating lunch, (fished in the cold driving rain 8am till 12:30 that was enough :) You had trailerd and were on the side of the road standing behind that BIG 275 verado trimmed full down..... man that thing is taller than you :) it must be almost 7ft. from skeg to cowling :) :) :) How was the trip in gen. It was nice to say hi again...... Dave Q."
561626,Guest,2006-10-16 13:55:00,0,"We did ok...nuttin happening on cranks 'tho. Everything was on rigs or jigs. Nothing over 30"". I did jig up 2 that were over 29"" in one drift. :) Weather was not very cordial...to put it mildly. We headed home Wed. morning,...after I slid part way down the hill on the fresh snow...just trying to get to the river. Then when we got to Twin Marine, the truck slid sideways while sitting still...in ""PARK"" ...out in the parking lot....we figured it was an ""OMEN"". Not being too excited about things anymore...we packed up and pulled out. :( Good seeing you ...and Clarkie, too."
561627,Dave Q,2006-10-16 15:09:00,1003,"Fishing.....what can you say....last year... bust em on cranks, this year SLOW. Might you be willing to tell me a ""little"" about how w/ what you jig, weight ect. Do you jig only when the currant is off or slow. Are you able to stay vertical. I would LOVE to catch a nice fish jigging. Thanks Dave. P.s. Im sure we will go up at least once more, more if the fishing is good. :)"

561639,Guest,2006-10-17 09:56:00,0,"Tmac & Dave We had a pretty slow, very COLD week as well. I managed a 30.5 inch 12# 4ozer on a lindy/leech and my wife landed an 11#er on a lindy also (Sun and Mon). Nothing over 7# on a crank this year....too bad I spent all those $$ on Reef Runners after last year!! We caught a lot of 5-8 # fish...and overall had a pretty good time in the COLD. The wind was nuts up there this year. It could have been worse for us....sounds like this week would have been worse for weather. Clarkie"
561640,Guest,2006-10-17 09:59:00,0,"Forgot to add that my mom & dad fished with us for an afternoon and my mom was able to hook a fat 21"" on a jig/leech. Also my brother was up one day and caught a beautiful 22"" sauger....man are they pretty up there....he was disappointed when I made him release it. Clarkie"

561721,Guest,2006-10-24 18:01:00,0,"Hey Dave thought i would give you an update on the river. I heard that the big fish are now going. Lots on cranks, not sure what the rig bite is like. I seen you out there a couple of weekends ago, i was in my buddies boat. I crashed my boat on to shore on the second day in the Vanity. I was coming around the corner at the first bend and lost my hydraulic steering. I was doing 54 mph when i lost steering, and was really pretty close to the north bank. I was doing around 45 plus when i hit. Got the boat ajusted last week at pally's. There is 5000 dollars damage to the hull, and need a new bottom end on my motor. Anyways I am going up this weekend to give it a try. Maybe I'll seeya up there. later"
