Would like to go someplace(Canada or USA) that we can just catch some fish and relax in a nice atmosphere for a few days. If anybody knows of any Resorts that cater to ice fisherman or any other icy water situation that could provide some fun and relaxation please help out an old warm water fisherman. If you would like to please email me at the following :[email protected] Thanks, Mike Kansas"

I'm going to give it a shot but my wife told me that she would appreciate it if I would go ice fishing next year and take her to Venice, La to do some Redfish fishing this year. So I will make the supreme sacrifice and grant my wife's request and go catch monster Reds for a few days. We have been there before and the Red fishing is awesome. I'm blessed that my wife love's to fish but it seems obvious that she doesent want to be fishing around ice and snow. Thanks again for all the info.....I really appreciate all your help. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
