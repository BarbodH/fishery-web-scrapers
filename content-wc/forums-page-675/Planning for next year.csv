Some other aquatic critters were hatching and the bite was tough. We had to fish deeper than normal to get fish. We'd mark ""clouds"" of bugs at 20'+ and then fish them, we did alright but nothing like when the bugs aren't hatching."

My Dad and I have the lodge, just trying to plan on the best time to maximize our fishing potential. So, what 2 weeks would you pick between July 1st and the 2nd week of October, to take advantage of the best time, calendar wise? We're leaning towards any 2 weeks in July, simply because of the fact that the weather would be more stable then into October, and the walleyes should be in a more predictable mood, and we should be able to catch them with a variety of different methods, such as slip bobbers, trolling spinners and cranks, etc...right or wrong? Thanks in advance...Dave"

561759,Jimmy Jig,2006-10-29 13:36:00,1905,I would pick the earliest in July as I could get reservations. Later it gets fish seem to go deeper and more scattered.

561769,guidedfishing,2006-10-30 18:59:00,531,"I have been fishing NW Ontario from early June through Mid September. I have really come to enjoy the first two weeks in September. The leaves are just starting, the number of fisherman out is very low, and the walleyes bite almost as good as June, and tend to run a little bigger in size. Weather is a crap shoot no matter when you go up, I have found the eyes already in deep patterns in July, (the last couple of years in July close to 95 degree plus temps tends to bake you out of the boat) just depends on the year. Bottom bouncing is always a good way to start out in July if the slip bobbers and jigs are not working. Either way you go its a win win, as long as your fishing. good luck GF"

I prefer the last couple of weeks of July, walleye's tend to stack up on the underwater reefs in very typical patterns. Good luck I look forward to the my retirement days."
