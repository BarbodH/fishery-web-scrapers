561676,Guest,2006-10-20 13:57:00,0,Lake Gueguen is located straight north of Toronto (approx 450KM)It is a beautiful location and has several lakes connected that may be fished. Walleye fishing is very good and large pike are not uncommon. A friend of mine and his Brother went there several years back and were very pleased with all aspects of the area.
561682,Guest,2006-10-21 09:40:00,0,"No, GueGuen is close to Val-D'Or, I think further north than Gouin."
561690,retire55,2006-10-22 10:26:00,1029,Lac Guéguen is approximately: a. 40 km east of Val D'Or b. 20 km south and 160 km west of the Gouin Reservoir. Google search identified one outfitter - see http://www.pavillonlacgueguen.com/
561695,joepa,2006-10-23 09:28:00,366,"retire55, Have you been there? Is the lake close to civilization, a bush road?"
561704,retire55,2006-10-23 21:16:00,1029,"No, I haven't been there myself. However, I'll be driving right by it next year as I have a walleye trip planned for an area about 100 miles north east of this lake. Lac Guéguen is maybe 13 miles east of a major north south highway (117) in Quebec. Here's a web version of the topo map that includes Lac Guéguen http://toporama.cits.rncan.gc.ca/ima.../03/032c03.gif Once it opens, click anywhere to get exploded view. You could also use Google Earth to view the area."
