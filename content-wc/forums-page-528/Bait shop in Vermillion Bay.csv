1217413,bpetersen,2010-07-08 21:36:00,251,I paid a terrible price of $47 a pound in Ear Falls first week of June. We had a person in camp tell us that walleye were doing well on leeches. We had better luck on crawlers. The guy must have been part owner in the bait shop.
1217477,stumcfar,2010-07-09 07:43:00,451,Thanks for listing the phone number. Found out they open at 5:00 on Saturdays and a lb. of leeches is $40.00. Should be on the water heading to the outpost in McKenzie Bay at this time tomorrow! Can't wait!!!
