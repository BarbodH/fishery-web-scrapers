1216684,eatsleepfish,2010-07-07 06:40:00,52,I am headed up to the Cabonga on Friday with overnight in Mont Laurier. My favorite shop for Crawlers and Leaches in L'Announciation (or Saint Veronique) will likely be closed so I figure I need to hit somewhere before that. Any recommendations?

If your staying overnight in Mont Laurier, it's a quick drive back to the bait shop in the morning...depending how early you plan on leaving. I would check the hours the bait shop is open the night before."

Incredible what you can find on the interwebs these days. I was able to find the store front on Google Map's Street View:http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&sour...278.44,,0,7.31"
