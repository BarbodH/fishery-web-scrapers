1217162,Mike Kansas,2010-07-08 08:14:00,1463,When were you there and where did you stay? Did you have a good week of fishing? What was your big Walleye? Mike Kansas
1217182,tv4fish,2010-07-08 09:02:00,2694,"We were there June 26-July 3. We stay at Red Pine Lodge (just south of Sioux Lookout). Weather was just a little ""changeable"" - like 42 degrees to 90 degrees. Wasn't our best year for ""catching"" . Biggest eye 25"""
1217229,Mike Kansas,2010-07-08 11:59:00,1463,"Same week we were there. Cold front the first two days made it slow but fishing warmed up after that. The last day was great in Bear on midlake humps. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1215796,Mike Kansas,2010-07-04 06:33:00,1463,"We just returned from Lost Island Lodge on Lac Seul and had another great week. Despite hitting a cold front the first two days of the week we had great fishing. Caught plenty of fish everyday and during our last two days we got into a bunch of fish that were over the slot. Lots of very fat 22"" to 24"" Walleye. All Eyes caught on Jig/Minnow and best depth was 16' to 23'. Biggest Walleye for the week was 27"" and we caught several that measured that length. My wife caught a fat 40"" Pike and she was very excited with that adventure. Thanks to Shane and his entire staff at Lost Island. This was our 6th year at Lost Island and as always they treat us GREAT. Mike Kansas"
1215821,fishman10,2010-07-04 08:17:00,226,"just returned from lost island lodge with my 2 nephews. one flew in from australia for the trip. he wanted to go for muskie as well as walleye. i have never fished muskie. we put on a couple of big raps and trolled into a bay in the manitou area. after 15 minutes, wham, 50 inch muskie landed. a guide boat from andersons came by and helped us. the guide said it was a 50 inch class fish. the walleye fishing was also great. well over 150 fish in 2 and half days with 2 just under 26inches. thanks to the crew from the lodge for making this a trip of a lifetime. we were treated great and i would recommend them to anyone."
1216042,Walleye Joe,2010-07-05 08:10:00,27,What size and color of jig? I'll be fishing from the 9th to the 16th.
1216090,Mike Kansas,2010-07-05 10:42:00,1463,"We had great luck with 3/8 oz and 1/4 oz Master Glitter Jigs from www.sirmanski.com. Needed the 3/8 when we were in deeper water. Gold, Chartreuse and red were the hot Glitter Jig Colors. Mike Kansas"
1216157,Walleye Joe,2010-07-05 14:57:00,27,Thank you!
1216399,winston123,2010-07-06 10:19:00,13,We just got back from Lac Seul near Ear Falls. Fishing seemed slower than other years. Walleye seemed deeper this year probably due to everything being ahead of schedule. We struggle a bit when the fish are down more than 12 feet. I don't think we are using jig heads big enough. Normally use 1/4 oz and when the wind hits we must not be on the bottom. Any other tips or methods you guys use?We did very well in the morning around rocky points or islands...especially if there were weeds and only if there was wind. I use Gulp or white twisters only. Buddy uses minnows. Didn't appear to matter once you found them. Around 11 things would slow down...probably because they just moved a bit deeper. We would strart catching them around the 4. Best place we found was cox island. However we did well on the islands outside of Sawmill and reefs near Goose Island. Point off of Steamboat also was good.
1216764,Mike Kansas,2010-07-07 09:43:00,1463,"The walleye on Lac Seul should be in their summer pattern now. We had great fishing on mid lake humps in deep water. Best was really in 20'+ water. If you can find a mid lake hump fish it hard and catch a bunch. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1216902,South Dakota,2010-07-07 15:23:00,24,How was the water level? Did you make it down to Mackenzie Bay? Thanks
1216925,Mike Kansas,2010-07-07 16:21:00,1463,"South Dakota, Water was down from last year at least two feet. We spent the majority of our time fishing the west and northwest part of the lake. Bear, Canoe and Grassy. What lodge are you staying at?"
1217133,tv4fish,2010-07-08 07:14:00,2694,"Hey Mike: You were fishing a lot of the same territory as we were ! Even though the water level IS lower than last year - it is still is probably close to ""normal"" up there. We had no problems - even running into Picnic Bay was no problem. We found most of our fish in the 14-18 foot range - Just FWIW."
