519696,Guest,2002-05-07 14:27:00,0,"WHY KILL THE EYES? NOT SURE THEY HAVE A REAL REASON. I WAS TOLD IT PREVENTS PEOPLE FROM CULLING. DON'T AGREE BUT ITS THE LAW AND AFTER FISHING LAC SUEL FOR 8 YEARS AND EVERY YEAR THE FISHING HAS CONTINUED TO IMPROVE. I WISH MINNESOTA WOULD FOLLOW SUIT. ANYWAY YOU WILL FIND THAT WHEN YOU THROW YOUR CATCH IN THE COOLER ON ICE THAT THEY KEEP ALOT BETTER THAN THEY WILL IN THE LIVEWELL. YOU WILL FIND THE PEOPLE AROUND EAR FALLS VERY ACCOMIDATING, AND UNLESS YOU WANT SOMETHING OUT OF THE NORM YOU CAN GET ANYTHING YOU WANT THERE. WERE GOING BACK IN AUGUST THIS YEAR,CAN'T WAIT!"
1216407,Guest,2010-07-06 10:41:00,0,"Just got back. There is some confusion about the rules this year - some in our group said that the law had changed and that if you have a ""machanical livewell"" (I guess that means a livewell capable of flushing and pumping in fresh water) that you did not have to kill the fish. We weren't positive about that rule change, so we played it safe and immediately killed the fish we decided to keep. In order to avoid any confusion about bag limits at checkpoints, we placed the fish we intended to take home into clear ziplock bags, and labeled them with the number of fish over and under the slot and the name of the person to whom the fish in that bag belonged (some of us had conservation licenses, others had the sportsman's). We left Hudson ONT for home at about 3:30am, and were in International Falls a little after 7:00. We did not encounter any checkpoints - we were too early even for the MNR, but we were all legal anyway, so it didn't matter. The fishing was phenomenal. No real monsters - the largest was 28"". But we caught many many fish over the slot and had a blast catching and releasing. The water in Lac Seul was down about three feet from last year, and the fishing was a little off, but still incredibly good. The US border guard on the way home asked us how we did, and when we told him that we did great he said that a lot of people had been reporting poor fishing. Still, I bet the worst day any of those groups was better than any day I've seen in Wisconsin for many years. Lac Seul is a gem, and the MNR's policies seem to work pretty well. They are certainly better at it than the WI DNR!"
1216473,wallydave,2010-07-06 13:39:00,2151,"One of my fishing trip buddies, made a club on his lathe about 16in long for walleye wompin! It works for checking your underslot fish too! One year after a boat from our camp had gotten busted for having beer in the boat, I was stopped by the OPP. I had a exchange student from Australia with me we had one too many walleyes in the cooler, but like earlier posts, we had a couple pike on top, no problem we were told! I often wonder, if we had not been from the same camp, if we would have gotten off with just a brief search?"
1216681,cruiseforever,2010-07-07 06:33:00,177,I like to place my fish in plastic garbage bags before putting them in the cooler. Helps keep the cooler clean for other things.
1216694,AllenW,2010-07-07 07:03:00,11482,"Always find it interesting when anybody who keeps a fish for mounting or eating gets ripped on one of these posts, yet the Canadian DNR is perfectly happy with people keeping fish, in fact they set slot and limits of fish just for that.How I do I know that?I sent them a email and they sent me a nice reply stating that.So..Please don't insult those that obey the law, you want to C&R, be my guest, I'll stay somewhere between total C&R and enjoy a fish or two..maybe three even.And I won't insult you for insulting me for doing something I can legally do..Not a fan of killing as I catch, as occasionally weather or poor fishing has left us with one or two fish and I'd rather release them, I have a rather large live well with both a circulation pump and one to fill with lake water and can keep fish alive for quite awhile.But..if that's what they want, so be it.I'd rather see you can only release heathly fish, but like said before, this will only effect those who obey the laws, hopefully the marjority of fishermen.Good point on the have all your ducks in a row when leaving, good chance you may get stopped and it makes it much smoother and quicker if your polite and prepared.Unless of course you get our favorite numbnuts and he wants to spread your semi froozen fish on the roadway while he does everything but a body search for god knows what.Then you just throw the fish away and stop at Morelys on the way home.Al"
1216701,wallydave,2010-07-07 07:12:00,2151,"As I understand it according to Andrea, Goose Bay Camp, on Lac Seul you are not permitted to use the livewell. She has upgraded boats with livewells, they worked for keeping our rain gear out of the way?! I have not researched the rules and regs on this, I was going on the word of the Camp operator."
1216927,leogunner,2010-07-07 16:34:00,18,The operators at Evergreen Lodge also ask that guests not keep any fish over the slot as well. It wasn't a big deal for my group as the larger the fish the better they reproduce. Plus all the large ones tend to female.
1217127,tv4fish,2010-07-08 07:08:00,2694,"leogunner: Re: the slot limit (18""-21"") and releasing fish ""over the slot"". Years ago, when the slot limit was first instituted on Lac Seul, we asked a MNR offficer how they determined the slot size. He told us the main reason was that studies had determined that the survival rates of the eggs from a female walleye of that size were the best. And, I guess if you think about it, it makes some sense - in the human species, what age group of females give birth to the ""healthiest babies"" ? Not 40-60 year old, but ""younger"" females."
1217273,leogunner,2010-07-08 14:22:00,18,Makes sense to me. Who knew science was helpful
1217410,walleyehawki,2010-07-08 21:31:00,21,All you need to do is cut the gills and put them head first into a five gallon pail and let them bleed out for a few minutes and then throw them on the ice in your cooler. I have been doing this for years and you have more storage space for tackle etc. in your boat by using your livewell for storage instead of filling it with water. Simply pickup a 50 quart Igloo marine cooler and put it in the aft of your boat!
519686,MNBS,2002-05-02 11:16:00,13,"To Kill a walleye is very easy. Just put the walleye on its stomach facing away from you. Then, with one hand holding the top of fish, put the other under the walleyes chin and pull head toward you until the neck breaks. This will instantly kill the fish. Northerns are a little tougher though. Bob"
519687,Larry,2002-05-02 13:49:00,357,Thanks for all the replys. I have been fishing for years and I have never heard a more ridiculus rule. The fisherman who is going to cull on a body of water that holds ample amounts of quality fish will probably not think twice about throwing away a dead fish. There will always be those fish hogs among those who fish. Some people will never understand the value of conservation....Thanks Again
519688,Guest,2002-05-02 19:21:00,0,"For years now,every Saturday morning the wardens have a fish check on hwy 105 south of Perrault Falls and another down on hwy 502 south of Dryden, or they alternate between the two spots. The camp owners all know this. I'll bet all the major routes are covered. I went down to Vermilion Bay and over to Dryden about 8AM one Saturday last summer and saw 11 marked pickups most with 2 officers in each."
519689,NateW,2002-05-02 20:15:00,96,"We hit one of those road blocks once--the one south of P. Falls. We saw it going into camp and were prepared. We had packed the cooler last so it was easy top get to. A Mounty stopped us on the highway and asked if we'd been fishing. (We figured the rods in the back were a give away but he was kind enough to at least ask!) We said yes, he told us to pull into the parking area. As soon as our vehicle came to a stop an MNR officer was there and asked to see all our fishing licenses. We each handed them to him and he checked to see if they were regular or conservation licenses. He then started inspecting our coolers and counting fish. It took all of five minutes and we were on our way. The MNR officer was stern yet very polite. Get this, when we were done and about to get back underway, the officer, shook all our hands and THANKED US for being so polite and cooperative.We noticed there was another group reading some MNR guy the riot act and from what we could tell they were a couple fish over and blaming the MNR for it! From these guys it was easy to see how Americans get such a bad reputation.We learned a couple things: Don't throw your license away until your home, always keep a patch of skin on your filets, wrap your filets in clear plastic, make sure the filets are easily accessable and always remember the MNR will treat you the same way you treat them. They may start out gruff and stern, but be cool, be honest and you won't have any trouble. They're just doing their jobs.Basically if you read the rules and follow them to the ""T"", you have nothing to worry about.By the way, we go to Lac Seul too and have the time of our lives! We even have our own custom fish clubs we made ourselves! If this rule is so ridiculous it will keep you away....Good! More fish for the rest of us to catch (and release.)"
519690,Guest,2002-05-02 21:21:00,0,"Last year we decided to drive form Cliff Lake to Lac Suel for a day of fishing. We put in at Fishermans Cove and proceded to McKenzie Bay. After catching and releasing about 200 W's, the 4 of us decided to bag our limits to take home. In the meantime, we had been adding some northerns to the cooler. At the end of the day we had 16 W's and 12 northerns which we seperated into two coolers, one for each vehicle. We had decided to clean them when we got back to Cliff. About a mile south of the Cove we encountered a game check. There were two MNR officers. One asked how many fish we had and then asked to see our licenses and coolers. The other officer opened the coolers and took one look at those slimey northerns on top of the W's and without touching a single fish he told the other one that everything looked good and closed the lid. We all had a good laugh at the MNR's enforcement of game laws. I guess the Canadians really do hate Jacks. TGG"
519691,2 DOGS,2002-05-02 21:45:00,361,"I would like to ask you a favor and that is to post again AFTER your fishing trip to Lac Seul. I think after you experience the fishing there ""under the most ridiculous rules"" you will come to the conclusion that hey, they must be doing something right. Maybe this slot limit and no live fish rule isn't so bad after all. I agree, there are still some who would throw away a dead fish, but those aren't fisherman or sportsman, those are the hogs you referred to. I for one would love to see each one caught and fined. I know I wouldn't hesitate to turn them in if I witnessed it. You'd be amazed how posessive people become of that particular resource and want to see it maintained at the existing quality level. Can you tell me the number of people who have kept from starving because of the additional meat on an 18"" walleye vs a 16"" ? My hat's off to the people who had the foresight to implement these kinds of rules that has produced this kind of fishing. I'm also one of those who'd love to be checked by the Conservation Officer every day. If he's out there checking me, then he's checking lots of others too!"
519692,Guest,2002-05-03 04:15:00,0,"We too were stoped on the road out of camp. by a VERY organized group of RCMP's. Same deal, 1st check on licences, then a thourough check of each wraped fish (we were advised by camp owner to wrap eace idividualy)& on our way in about 5 mins. Most of the vehicles at the road stop were the same, on their way in just a few mins. We did see one group with almost everything in their Suburban & boat spread out all over the gravel. Must have done or said the wrong thing to warrent that kind of checking. IMHO follow the rules to the letter & be polite the RCMP are only doing their jobs & helping to protect what is THEIRS so WE can enjoy it for years to come. I hope they keep it up so my grandsons can enjoy the fishing."
519693,Larry,2002-05-03 08:16:00,357,I dont have any problems with the limit or the slot on Lac Seul. In fact I applaud this management of the fishery.I just have a hard time understanding how KILLING fish will keep some jacka-- fisherman from culling.
519694,Big Tim,2002-05-03 08:55:00,63,"Just like most home & car door locks, they're only there to keep the honest people honest."
519695,Guest,2002-05-03 16:08:00,0,"If a party was to be found to have an extra fish, it is very important that someone steps up to the plate and tells the officer it is his fish. If nobody comes forward they are obligated to charge everyone and confiscate all the fish rather than the ""guilty"" one."
519676,Larry,2002-05-01 14:23:00,357,We are going to Lac Seul for the first time this year. A friend of mine said he fished Lac Seul several years ago and if you were going to keep a Walleye you had to kill it. He claimed that if you had a live Walleye in your possesion you would be fined. Is this true and if so WHY?????
519677,Guest,2002-05-01 14:48:00,0,"Larry, I heard the same thing about other lakes, but not sure if that is true about Lac Seul. The reason behind it is too keep more fish alive. If you catch a fish and put it on a stringer or even in a live well for any amount of time, in pursuit of a larger fish, you put undo stress on the fish in the live well or on the stringer, Then you release the one in the live well back into the water, its chances of dying are much greater. So if you are forced to kill the fish, then you cannot play this game of larger selection and more fish live to swim another day."
519678,Guest,2002-05-01 14:52:00,0,"Basically, he is right. There is a slot limit of 18-21 inches in which you cannot keep any fish. in your possession (at that means in the boat as well as in you cabin) you can only have 5 per license. Also, once in the boat no live wells are permited so, in affect, the fish is either thrown back or kept and when kept it is dead. The reasoning is that this prevents the culling of fish. Now that the bad news.The good news is this. Fishing at Lac Suel is superior. Not just good but superior. If you have some basic knowldge and spend enough time you will catch hundreds of walleye over a weeks time.If your interested in knowing more give me a call [email protected]"
519679,Mahumba,2002-05-01 15:26:00,345,I thought possession for walleye was four? Is Lac Seul different than the rest of the province?Roger Mayer.
519680,2 DOGS,2002-05-01 16:35:00,361,"It was 4 walleye last year and I don't think it's changed for this year. And yes, all fish in your posession must be dead. Start carrying a cooler with ice for keeping your fish. That also includes what you had for shore lunch."
519681,Big Tim,2002-05-01 16:44:00,63,"Unless they changed it from last year 4 total is the limit on lac Seul, & only 1 can be over the slot & all must be dead. I too thought it was a pretty dumb rule, until I saw first hand how great the fishing can be. Where else can you boat up to 100 or more 15""--28"" Walleye in one day? Just remember, 4 TOTAL don't think you can have 3 back at camp in the freezer & catch 2 more for lunch. Unless you catch that wall hanger you've always dreamed of, Don't start freezing any for the trip home till the last couple of days. Eat as many as you want, just no more than 4 at a time. (like anybody could eat 4 of this size fish at one sitting!)"
519682,Jigger1,2002-05-01 18:42:00,234,"and if you catch that wall hanger you always dreamed of ... TAKE A PHOTO and put her back in Lac Seul! The photo will last you a life time and you can always get a replica produced. The limit is four for a full license and two with a conservation license. You must immediately kill the fish you keep so as not to try and upgrade your catch. Anyone keeping a walleye over 18"" on Lac Seul or any other body of water should have their head checked!Practice catch and release so there are more for all of us."
519683,Guest,2002-05-01 18:50:00,0,"Remember what the above posts have said, 4 fish TOTAL.I was checked by a warden last year and he kept asking me what we had for lunch!!!Did we have fish for lunch?Don't we like fish for lunch?I almost had to tell him I did'nt like fish!He would'nt get off the subject.Why?Because the fish you eat are considerd part of your bag limit.The freezer at camp,your cooler,and your belly better total 4 or less per regular license or you'll get to know the man better than I did.By the way, been fishing Lac Seul for 11 or 12 years and it's fantastic!Good Luck,be safe,bring GOOD map and compass."
519684,Guest,2002-05-02 10:14:00,0,"I didnt know that thatmany people knew about this lake. We have been going up there for 20 years now and it just keeps getting better. When the wind is out of the east it gets rough. The falls from the wanasaga river is good, sawmill bay and Mckenze bay. have a gooood time."
519685,Guest,2002-05-02 10:18:00,0,We found it very difficult to kill the fish. A rap on the head just sort of stuns it. We would just throw in the ice chest. Just dont miscount. One year we knew somthing was up when even the camp owner said as we were getting ready to leave. Lets count those fish one more time. Of course 50 miles down the road was abunch rcmps checking fish.
