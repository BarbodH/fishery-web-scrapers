1217206,Guest,2010-07-08 10:52:00,0,"Really! perhaps I could IM a photo of a ""tourney"" walleye (73 cm) 29"" for the Yanks with a seagull standing on it's gill plate, barely alive with it's eye pecked out, so much for fizzing, just east of Whiskey Island due to irresponsible ""long lining in 60+ ft of water. Are you kidding me! No mortality! Are you familiar with delayed mortality, What a waste of valuable resources for a few bucks and ego kick!"
1217218,Danny61,2010-07-08 11:27:00,42,No tourney angler is going to longline 60 feet of water for a big fish even pulling a fish out of 40 feet is extremely risky all experienced tournament anglers know that
1217240,Aaron-IN,2010-07-08 12:52:00,500,"I knew I shouldn't have asked the questionSeriously, what does the long lining have to do with it if the fish are only 20 feet deep, suspended under baitfish? Just wonderin"
1214751,steven paulson,2010-06-30 05:43:00,20,Sitting in Minaki watching the world go by. Yesterday i caught 75 walleyes. The biggest 24in. Every place you stop there are fish. Caught a few northern and smallies. Looks like another great day out there got to go fishing.
1214759,KSauers,2010-06-30 06:16:00,385,3 weeks to go yet before 2 weeks in heaven. What spots have been pretty good and what's catchin them?
1215042,DonC,2010-07-01 04:34:00,93,"Sitting in Minaki watching the world go by sounds like ""living the dream"". We leave tomorrow and will spend the night in Winnipeg, and get in to Minaki to fish the afternoon on Saturday hopefully. Have my wife in tow (does not fish), with 2 daughters and their husbands (they all fish), and some other non-family. Catching 75 walleyes is something. I fish smallmouth primarily and have had 2 days with similar amount of smallmouth as my personal best up there. I will post after I get back on July 10. Appreciate the advice from Aaron and ChuckE, and all the rest. DonC"
1216318,steven paulson,2010-07-06 07:00:00,20,Just got back from Minaki. Water is coming up in one week the Woods had about 12in. of rain. getting lots of water flowing. Fishing is good lots of big fish (walleye). Northern and bass are bitting to. Every place you stop you catch fish. I'll be back in Minaki in August for the Roach tour.
1216444,Tony Shirley,2010-07-06 12:26:00,211,Make sure u bring the buca Steve lol
1216810,Danny61,2010-07-07 11:52:00,42,Is the Gary Roach going to happen in august I thought it was called off due to lack of interest? If is is going to happen what changes are made and what are the dates?
1217108,steven paulson,2010-07-08 06:22:00,20,Gary Roach tour. is still on from what we were told. They were talking the same format as the Minaki Classic.
1217121,Aaron-IN,2010-07-08 06:58:00,500,"Steven/Tony,Just asking because I've never fished a tourney. I'm just wondering if the walleye get measured and weighed then released right after caught or do they sit in livewells and get hauled back to Minaki then are measured, weighed then released? If the later any idea on the deadloss? Do the fish caught need to be in the slot? Also, any idea what the biggest fish for the tourney was? Thx"
1217131,Tony Shirley,2010-07-08 07:12:00,211,Hi Aron Yes the fish are brought back to weigh in immediately so no fizzing is required they are released within in 20 mins of being caught and there is no mortality.Yes that have to be in the slot under 45 or over 70cm.Biggest was 8.5 lbs
1217142,Aaron-IN,2010-07-08 07:31:00,500,"Tony,That is good to hear, thx!"
1214186,Aaron-IN,2010-06-28 11:14:00,500,"Returned on the 26th from a 9 day trip. Weather was great (except for 1st day) fishing was good (except for 1st day) and the bugs were pretty much non-existant. Had a few personal best, with 28 and 29 inch walleye and a 21 1/2 inch smallmouth also caught a 42 inch Pike. The smallmouth fishing was really good with many fish in the 16-18 inch range. We didn't fish for walleye much at all but did catch many, all of which were over the slot. Most were 18-22 inches, seems like it is getting harder and harder to catch slot fish on that system anymore. This is probably the first time in 10 years I have not caught a good muskie up there, in fact I didn't see a muskie this trip. And to top things off, US customs were very nice so nothing bad to say about them. There were a lot of boats up there this year and I suspect many were pre-fishing for the walleye tournament coming up."
1214233,Aaron-IN,2010-06-28 13:34:00,500,"LOL, just re-read my post and started laughing. Sounded like a commercial for some lodge in Minaki. Guess I should have just said it was a good trip"
1214259,wolverine fan,2010-06-28 14:49:00,71,"sounds like an awesome trip!! 42"" northern on bass gear must have been a hoot! we better start telling people the fishing is drying up and fish nonexistent or we may be taking a number in line each morning lol!"
1214270,DonC,2010-06-28 15:23:00,93,"Aaron, Glad you had a great trip. I have never caught a 21.5 inch smallmouth in Canada. The largest for me was 20.5 inches on the French River, and the largest at Minaki was 19 or 19.5 inches. Congratulations!!! Your smallmouth would be pushing 6 LBS. down here in TN or KY. What was the pattern and presentation you used on the smallmouth if you do not mind sharing? Any topwater action? Our group, myself with wife, 2 daughters and husbands, and others will be up this Saturday out of Birch Island. 3 boys ages 8-11 years old who have never fished in Canada with their Dads will come later in the week. I have your and ChuckE's recommendations from earlier this year which I appreciate and will refer to next week. Thanks, Don"
1214274,Aaron-IN,2010-06-28 15:35:00,500,"Don, some probably find this hard to believe but I used a topwater bait (Torpedo) 95% of the time this year, the other 5% I used a Senko and that was only to follow up on a topwater miss at the same bass. It was sort of a strange week, the bass were found pretty much in and around bedding areas and not so much around the islands. There were still bass spawning in some areas. I think the weather the previous three weeks really screwed things up. We were lucky to hit the stable weather pattern, by the end of the week it really was a feeding frenzy."
1214294,DonC,2010-06-28 16:47:00,93,"Aaron, That is incredible!!! Did you get much numbers on topwater, and what depth and structure did you find them on? I have some Tiny Torpedoes in frog with yellow belly color. What model and color did you use? I have never caught a smallmouth on topwater in Canada because I use tubes, grubs and once in a while jig spinners and bandits. Your post has given me confidence to give it a serious effort. Thanks for the tip, Don"
1214322,Aaron-IN,2010-06-28 18:02:00,500,"Don, mind you I didn't get South of Harbour Island all week but we both averaged around 40-50 bass a day each and both using 3 inch torpedos, they were green with a yellow belly and a red mark on the underside towards the front of the lure. Structure wise we found them mostly in very shallow pockets in and around big bays and back in some of the bays (pretty much in and around spawning structure) as well as shallow points. There were times when you literaly had to get the lure right on the waters edge, if you were two or three feet short you wouldn't get a hit. For the most part the spawn was pretty much over and most bass caught were good size males. I forgot to mention that around day 4 there was a pretty serious mayfly hatch going on. This was the first time in years I didn't bother tube fishing. Also, I know it's early but the crank bite is on up there right now for the big walleye."
1214353,Reels,2010-06-28 20:04:00,2876,"We found the same thing but my go to lure was a blue and silver husky jerk with a chomper stinky tube to follow up. We did very good around Mine bay and between the hatrack all the way to duck reef shores. Mayfly hatch was the heaviest I have ever seen, but it is cooler most of the time when I go. We just fished areas with deeper water adjacent to it and did fine. Walleye was some of the best I have seen in years. Lots of Northerns, but fist year I remember not seeing a Musckie"
1214356,DonC,2010-06-28 20:07:00,93,"Aaron, I am never up there is August when that bite is going on. I take it that you are referring to the evening Big Sand crankbait trolling for suspending big walleye. Is that pattern good during the morning and afternoon? Just got back from Gander Mountain and stocked up on Baby Torpedoes. Will post a report when I get back. Thanks, Don"
1214418,Aaron-IN,2010-06-29 06:35:00,500,"Don, you don't have to go up to Big Sand to troll over deeper water for the big walleye. Just look for the baitfish breaking the surface, and look for the gulls then use your electronics. I was always busy bass fishing and only went out trolling after dinner, around 8:00 pm. The later in the week the better the bite was later at night, right before dark.good luck"
