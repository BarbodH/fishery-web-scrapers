1209810,Gipper,2010-06-13 18:48:00,76,I think I can find Bay of Pigs. Walleye bite is moving shallow. Weather warming this week through our arrival on the 19th. Can you say Wally Diver? Can you say Tail Dancer?Glenman should be into them by now.
1212177,Terwalleye,2010-06-21 15:51:00,166,"Hey GangHeadin' up to Cedar for the first time. Leaving this Friday. Awwwww mannn!! Was just wondering if the mayfly hatch was all done? Also, saw some mention of of the various flies and no-see-ums. Are they bad?Glenman ......How'd your group make out this year?To all you WC folks, thanks sooo much for some great tips and advice. And mostly for helping time go by reading all these tidbits for the past few months.ThanksTerwalleye"
1212262,Glenman12,2010-06-21 19:48:00,762,"Our trip was better than average except for the last day..the weather (barometer) was up and down..we caught a ton of walleyes in the 14-15"" range..whatever hatch they were from had to be a record for survival..everyday bigger walleyes up to 22"" were caught with regularity but not quite the hot bite we had last year..the smallies were out of this world..one new guy to our group who fishes in largemouth bass tourneys was going out of his mind..him and his partner caught 50-75 in the 14-18"" range almost everyday..they were just casting, cranks, spinner baits or poppers over rock points...I had the biggest northern on..had him to the boat twice but on the third try he went under the boat and the line went..no more 8# flourocarbon on my trolling rig...he was all of 42"" and very broad.. The mayfly hatch was in full swing when we left..hopefully it will be done by the time you get up there..I dont think it really affected our fishing except for the last day...out of approx 15 man hours, 6 guys targeting walleyes caught only one on the last day but I did get an 18"" smallie and the guys fishing them got over 50 The no seeums were there but were kind to me...only went after my hands and not my legs.. When we crossed on Friday the 11th the customs agent told us 502 was washed out so we had to go up 71...coming back you could get thru but it was one lane at a time..they had the flaggers out there and lights were set up indicating that they were working 24/7 to get it back to normal.. any other questions feel free to IM me.."
1212308,go dart,2010-06-21 20:59:00,77,"Spent last week on Perrault, Jackfish, and a little Cedar. Nice! Best walleye fishing I've had in 6 trips. Actually returned 6 fish over the 18"" mark. Did catch a nice walleye in Ord river that someone had gut hooked, cut the line and released. She was still eating. Who am I to argue with Karma, I put her back too! Glennman our last day was thurs and with that wind pounding the backside of a couple Islands we were clobbering em with Pike and Smally's mixed in too. The walleye bellys sure nuff had mayflies in em but they still hit leaches like they were free. Gee wizz I'm still scratching my ankels from those no see ums. I think they wanted my beer. Trying to pull a mid Agust off. Meh we'll see."
1212315,djarz929,2010-06-21 21:07:00,40,Leaving Friday..... I'm like a kid waiting for Christmas. From what I can see on the web it looks like 502 is open. Just check at the border and they'll let you know for sure.

1213868,Kevin R,2010-06-27 10:52:00,305,That should have been Ord Lake Falls not Thaddeus.

1214169,Larry Mac,2010-06-28 10:30:00,530,"Our Group returned from Cedar Lake Saturday 6/26/10 from 1 week of fabulous fishing. The weather was cooperative and so were the fish. Walleye, Smallmouth, Northern and Perch were active. The largest walleye was 27.5"", Largest Smallmouth was 20"", largest perch was 12"" and the Largest northern was 38"". We personally did not fish the musky but we did see Bob Messecomer filming an episode of ""Simply Fishing ""on the lake. The mayfly hatch was just finishing up and did not appear to hamper our fishing. Activity was good and the trip was an overall success. Crossing into and out of Canada was uneventful. Have a great yearThank you,Larry Mac"
1217085,Terwalleye,2010-07-08 00:33:00,166,"Came home from Cedar on July 2nd. 1st time up there and absolutely loved it!! Stayed at Northern Lights and kudos to Jeff and Connie for being 1st class hosts. Already counting down to the 2nd annual trip.Found lots of good eater walleyes in Hatfield bay. Every susnset was spent their getting lunch for the next day. Fishing was great just about everyday. We ate multiple dinners after sunset; becasue we were too busy catching fish. Great problem!!! Found some of those jumbo perch; but they were not consistant. The perch and a lot fo the eyes came on leeches with slip bobbers in 11 ft on weed edges. Found some bigger 23"" to 25"" eyes later in the week in 25 feet rocky island points with jig and minnowspics from the triphttp://canadacedarlake2010.shutterfly.com/#We hired Wilderness Air for a fly out for the day. WOW what a great flight and GREAT fishing. 3 guys in our boat boated 257 walleyes averaging 18-19 inches. We didn't count the perch or pike. First time I was ever actually sore from ""catching."" Feel free to PM, if I can help I will. Lots of you all helped me out and thanks again!!"
1206089,djarz929,2010-06-01 20:46:00,40,24 days.....it's killing me....greased up 2 of my baitcasters and put on new line tonight.
1206117,Rich B,2010-06-01 21:42:00,1081,"Terwalleye, I just returned from Cedar Lake Lodge spending last week up at camp with my brother and 3 other good friends......had a great week, although the weather was rough to begin the week (bad lightning storm that rolled in Sunday evening and it rained/lightning thru Monday night). As to your questions....can't recall seeing anyone use a cell, though the camp has a phone in the lodge set up for ""phone cards"".....I picked one up at Walmart and it worked fine. Camp also has a computer set up, and you can use it for your emails, etc. Fishing was good, especially considering Sunday evening's storm. Our group fished for walleyes, and the biggest was 26"", largest pike was 43"" and a 44"" Musky, along with assorted smallmouth bass and a few jumbo perch.....most of the walleye were 16"" - 21"". Weeds are up in some of the bays.....fishing should be excellent again this year. Will be going back up 3rd week of Sept....can't wait for that trip. Rich B"
1206127,nitroman,2010-06-01 22:17:00,368,I was up ther last week also and the walleye bite was great. We mostly pulled and pitched cranks and pitched jigs in the evening. Seemed to be holding tight to structure and the weedbeds were on fire on the east side. Trolloing a crank pitching a crank or a jig and twister up to the weed edges really produced for us. The deeper weeds out in Hatfield bay were a great spot also producing many 18-23 inch eyes for us. Smallmouth bite was outstanding on about any rocky shore we had alot in the 14-19 inch range. Alot of northerns wow alot of northerns in the mid to upper 20s. We all caught multiple muskies while trolling for walleye big ones were 33 35 36 38 and a 44. Alot of walleye from 16-25 inches and our biggest was a 31 a fish of a lifetime for my buddy that caught it in an area we have called the bay of pigs due to the number of trophy eyes we have pulled from there over the years! Wind sucked but once we got a system down for pulling cranks with the big motor we caught em. For the entire week I caught maybe a dozen walleye on minnows sure was a cheap bait bill for us last week! Good luck to all heading up and I hope your week was as good as ours. Hatfield equals Hotsteel!
1206147,Glenman12,2010-06-02 05:00:00,762,Hey Nitroman By chance does the bay of pigs have houses on it?
1206195,nitroman,2010-06-02 06:51:00,368,Nope it's south of CPR between the islands and the south shore of times square.
1206249,Glenman12,2010-06-02 09:26:00,762,never been in there..if its the one Im thinking of it always struck me as a northern spot....but will try it in 9 days..
1208100,JBwvu,2010-06-08 10:08:00,18,"Is this Catch, Photo, and Release? If so, I didn't know there was such an area on Cedar. Guess I need to find out."

1208181,JayM5209,2010-06-08 14:16:00,1050,"Terwalleye, I was at Gold Arrow Camp last week on Jackfish Lake, just up the road from Cedar. Same fishing report as others have posted. Walleyes were plentiful, with the biggest for our group being a 25""er from Cliff Lake while trolling for lakers. Big perch came more frequently as the wet week wore on. We did notice that the walleyes, except for one day on Ord, were on average bigger and chunkier than the past several years.As to cell service --- my AT&T phone loses signal as soon as we cross in Ft. Francis. No surprise since their signal coverage stinks everywhere. One guy's Altel phone received calls all week but he could not call out. The guy with the U.S. Cellular phone had a strong clear signal in camp and most other places along Hwy. 105. Last year my son's Sprint blackberry had full service almost anywhere we went, including some fairly remote lakes. Have a great trip"
1209545,JBwvu,2010-06-12 16:36:00,18,"Won't have to spend any time looking for a Catch, Photo and Release area! Duh on me! Will be at Cedar Lake Lodge next Sat. (19th). Looks like the fishing is going to be similar to last year at this time except the Muskies may do more than cruise by the boat. I hope so!Thanks again."
1184747,mata,2010-04-01 15:53:00,78,"Thinking of making a trip to Cedar Lake Lodge in September for walleyes, can anyonr give me a report on the quality of fishing on this lake. Would like to know about sixe and numbers. If someone has been to this resort can you take your own boat? thanks"
1184788,Glenman12,2010-04-01 19:17:00,762,I sent you a private message..
1184842,Rich B,2010-04-01 20:49:00,1081,"Mata, Glenman will get you excellent information on the lake - he helped me last year and a group of us went up last Spring. We had such a successful week we booked again for this Spring, as well as going up the 3rd week of September. Lot's of great water up in the western area of Ontario, though Cedar Lake has my vote. Rich B"
1184922,Blue Lk,2010-04-02 06:42:00,269,"I live in NWO & this is my backyard,if I were spending the $$ to come up here fishing I would be going a few more miles north to Lac Seul.Most lakes in the area (ie Cedar Lk) have excellent fishing but Lac Seul has the best,even some remote fly-ins can't match it.I do not work for any outfitters,Lac Seul or other wise,this is just m2cw."
1184926,Larry Mac,2010-04-02 06:49:00,530,"Hi Mata, Rich B is correct in his statement about Glenman12's knowledge and experience regarding Cedar Lake. Glenman12 assisted our group last year and we were so successful we are going back twice this year. His knowledge, experience and willingness to help our group was absolutely invaluable. He definitely knows his lake and he is a heck of a nice guy, no brag just fact. Have a great 2010 season.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1184953,lonewolf73,2010-04-02 07:45:00,17,"If you are considering Cedar Lake, I say go for it. I'm headed back up the first week of June for the 5th year in a row and have been fishing Cedar the last 8 years. We fish out of Jerry & Ellie's Cedar Lake Camp across the lake from Cedar Lake Lodge. I don't personally know Glenman but I would take his advice as I know he has been fishing the lake for years. I have also fished Lac Seul and agree with Blue Lk regarding the quality of the fishing. The major difference is in the size of the body of water and how rough it can get when the wind gets cranked up. Everybody's opinion of rough water is different depending on your comfort level. Getting back to the fishing on Cedar, we have found the location of the fish to be different each of the last few years but after a day or two of patterning the fish, we were able to catch plenty of walleye. The fishing during the first week of June last year will be hard to top. We had days where it was difficult to catch fish small enough to eat. What a blast! It looks like ice out will probably be earlier this year so it be interesting to see where the fish will be this year.Good luck in your decision. I will also be happy to provide any help that I can.P.S. - Glenman, we should compare notes some day!"
1185264,mata,2010-04-03 08:41:00,78,"Thanks for the helpful reports, looks as if we will make a trip to this lake in sept. We will be spending two weeks at Basket Lake N.E. of Dryden in June which has the same fishing as you describe here. Nice to be retired and able to fish as much as you want! Seems like since they put the length limit on walleyes in Ontario that the size of the fish caught has steadily increased, which is very good. Good fishing"

Also, has anyone had luck using a cell phone in camp? If so, which cell company? I saw a post once upon a time on this; but I don't think it was Cedar Lake specific.Thanks in advanceTerwalleye"
