I've made dozens of spinners from components we have bought through him and our guests love them.You can also buy some pre-tied hooks with 25 lb line all ready to add beads, blades and clevises. Check him out and get int ouch via email/phone. You will be glad you did."

1216427,IA Nate,2010-07-06 11:55:00,12,"We've been making our own spinners for years and have used many of the sources listed above. A few years ago I bought a small tackle box just for keeping all the spinner making parts. This goes with us on every trip up north. Sometimes it's necessary to tie a few more in the cabin at night due to bite-offs, etc. and other times we find the fish interested in a color we didn't anticipate. Three or four guys working on a spinner-making assembly line can tie a lot of spinners in the span of two beers."

1216578,Putzer5,2010-07-06 19:14:00,11,"Try D&B fishing.... at www.d&bfishing.com They have a great selection of materials. I used to make my own, but now I buy them from D&B for $1.00 each. They will make you anything that you want. Easy to deal with. Use the website to find what you want, then call them to order. The website is useless, as far as ordering"
