1216994,Golden Eagle,2010-07-07 19:20:00,2642,"I've fished NW Ontario a lot in August, a few times in September and a whole lot in October. Never had a bad week. September and October are a time of change and it's an exciting time for fishermen. I've made several October trips alone and several times have been the only fisherman in camp. The outfitter buzzes me when he comes to pick me up. That means two things: 1. bring in a limit of 4 walleyes because he's going to be my dinner guest. 2. He'll beat me to camp and a couple of extra beers will be in the fridge to chill by the time I make it in."

Plus, if you head to the Morson area it's several hours closer by car than some of the other lakes that are options. (if time is a constraint)www.obabikon.com You can also send me an email or PM and I can suggest several awesome resorts in the area."

We usually hit Sunlight a couple of times or hit Big Sandy Lunker Point, Steamboat Narrows Shanty Narrows, Ghost Narrows, Windgo Point and some of the Islands south of there. I have also found that if they are pumping alot water through the dam, the better the fishing is. Find the currant areas. I hope this helps you out."

There are too many things going on with kids and sports in May, June, and July so thats why we went then. We keep going back because of the great fishing we have had. Never gone in October, but would love to someday. Weather has been all over the board, but the fishing has always been great so we have had no reason to change."
1217170,Golden Eagle,2010-07-08 08:40:00,2642,"I go in October, not looking for a perfect trip, but because it's my last shot until May. At least a couple of times I've had no plans to go until noon on Wednesday and I was out of my driveway at 4 a.m. Thursday. All it takes is to find out when I can hitch a flight into camp and I'm gone."

We have had many great days anchored up below the dam and jigging them up. Little Canada Camp is right below the dam and it is very resonablly priced and they have great boats. You can be at the dam from there in 5 minutes. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
