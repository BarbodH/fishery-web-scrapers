1216083,stevensinks,2010-07-05 10:09:00,330,I had not checked on my night crawlers for about a week. I went out and checked them today and they were dead. Im thinking about not getting more until I get to Canada that way I dont have to worry about them. Do any of you know what they are selling for in Red Lake or along the way to Red lake/ Thanks
1216105,Gary from Iowa,2010-07-05 11:33:00,74,"CharlieOn our way to Bow Narrows last year, we bought 2 one-half flats of nightcrawlers-one for each boat, we picked our leeches at a bait shop in ear falls. Vados Bait shop offers ""Canadian packs"" in various sizes and numbers of night crawlers. The container's are foam and come with a frozen gel pack. You wrap the gel pak in newspaper and put in with the crawlers. We had extra packs so we could swap out for a fresh one and refreeze the old one. My guess that a half flat would be sufficient for the two of you, but who knows when fishing. I'd get some leeches in Canada.BTW, get some duct tape to keep the flats closed. The crawlers can get out. Nice way to start the morning is pick crawlers off the floor, clothes, etc.My brother Lee and I are discussing a potential trip to Seine River Lodge in September.Good Luck at Bow Narrows and don't eat too much lemon pie.GaryVados Bait in Twin Cities, web:http://www.vadosbait.com/"

1216247,Guest,2010-07-05 21:32:00,0,You can also get them at Ear Falls at 4 seasons for about $56 a flat. That way you don't have to mess around with them on the way up.
1216251,bpetersen,2010-07-05 21:43:00,251,$55 a flat Bobbies in Vermilion Bay. Does any one know if a flat of crawlers in the US is the same size as in Ontario?
1216325,Guest,2010-07-06 07:09:00,0,"After 30-odd trips babysitting crawlers, last year I bought a flat at Four Seasons in Ear Falls. A flat is 500 crawlers. They were very good size and quality, and I've ordered them again for this year's trip. They were in a lot better shape toward the end of the week than the ones I used to bring from home. Price was within a buck or two of local prices."
1216335,stevensinks,2010-07-06 07:48:00,330,Thanks for the info guys. When my wife and I go up we take 3 or 4 days to get there as we like to see what is along the road. Then I always have to worrry about the worms. It looks like there is $10.00 diffrence in the price here and there. For that I will buy them there and not have to worry about them.
