I'm returning to Ontario (with my wife, son, and daughter) in a couple weeks for the first time in 17 years. I made a reservation at a motel in International Falls for Friday night and plan on getting up early Saturday morning to cross the border. Would anyone have any tips for how early in the morning one should head for the bridge? The last time I crossed there, it was about mid-day on a Saturday in June, and we wound up in line for over 3 hours. I'm hoping to avoid that again. Thanks!"

A nice motel on rainy lake with a good resturant, Then on Saturday morning you don't need to think about the crossing. By the way, I doubt you'll have a 3 hour wait but it could be long."

1215574,Stu,2010-07-02 23:30:00,472,"Hi Bluestem, welcome to Walleye Central. You've already made your reservations so crossing the night before is a moot point. We stay in Int. Falls the night before too. I make sure I'm at the border no later than 6am and things go pretty smoothly. We tried to cross at 9am once and had to wait forever."
1215580,Big Tim,2010-07-03 04:41:00,63,We always aim for 5 AM. No problems and there is a great restaurant across from Rainy near the eastern end of town that opens at 5 for a good breakfast. I'll be there EXACTLY one week from right now. YEAH!
1215646,2746,2010-07-03 11:06:00,3206,"Actually it's not a moot point, reservations can easily be cancelled but, of course, the decision is Bluestem's. Getting two kids up and going in time to get to the border early is not always fun and even for me is a hassel I prefer to avoid. Hence the Friday night crossing. Either way the trip will be a great family experience!"
1215677,Nimstug,2010-07-03 14:36:00,2605,"Tim refers to the restaurant almost right next to La Place. Between the two is a gas station / bait shop. Very convenient, no need to move the tow vehicle / boat."
1215727,LoDo,2010-07-03 19:43:00,721,"I returned from Lac Seul last Friday night. Fishing was great in McKenzie Bay!! We crossed Sat 6/19 at/around 630a after eating breakfast by the place on main, in front of the Tee-Pee hotel. The crossing was effortless and quick. I would think Sat before 7-730a is good. Staying in Fort Frances is always a good options too."
1215847,Pines,2010-07-04 09:40:00,10,"I crossed yesterday,7/3/10 coming back in,zero wait time .Looked the same going the other way.8:30 am."
1216232,Bluestem,2010-07-05 20:16:00,7,"Thanks for the information and tips. I guess I'll keep my reservation in Falls, and just get going early on Saturday morning. Might take a bucket of cold water to get the kids moving, but they'll get over it when we start fishing!! I can't wait to get there - it's been way too long! Thanks again everyone!"
