1217132,MaP,2010-07-08 07:13:00,5,My brother and I are planning a surprise 70th birthday trip for our dad this fall but need some advice. My dad has been fishing since the age of 5 but has not been able to break the 10lb walleye mark so we trying to get him to a place that will allow him a chance. We have chosen Bay of Quite but need some advice on a place to stay. We are looking for a fully guided trip that can put us in the right place. We are looking to go over Halloween weekend but I'm afraid it might be to early in the fall. My questions are:1. Where is a good place to stay and guide?2. Is Halloween weekend to early.Any help will be greatly appreciated.Mark

Don't have any personal experiance at Bay Of Quinte, but I would also love to take my Dad up there sometime. Here is a website that might steer you in the right direction.http://www.quintefishing.com/"

He can set you up with accomadations, guiding if you prefer or if you wanna take your own boat will give you any info or pointers you need. FISH HUNTER"
