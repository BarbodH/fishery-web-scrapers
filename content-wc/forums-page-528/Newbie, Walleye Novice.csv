My son and I had the time of our lives. In addition to lots of beautiful speckled trout (AKA brook trout), we fished Lac Chenet for walleyes. Our guide, Pierre, taught us more about walleye in a half day than I have learned in a lifetime. Anxious to start fishing for walleye here in VT. I would highly recommend this outfitter, and know they have many accomodations on lakes with big, plentiful walleye. Thanks for all you taught us, Pierre. Carl & Joe"

I guess my first quesion, would be how far do you want to travel, for your fishing trips? Second, which plan American or housekeeping, Drive, boat, or fly-in are all things to consider when planning your next trip. Glad your first trip went well, and I hope yout fellow walleye wranglers will 'put you on the fish"""
