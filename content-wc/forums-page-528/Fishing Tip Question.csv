Was asked to go this weekend over the 4th of July weekend to same lake. Normal August walleye patterns are to troll early and late in day with worm harness in 15 to 25 feet of water. We do usually throw a few stick baits on and will catch about a third of our fish on the stick baits. I will jig when we are not trolling and have had fair success in deeper water, over 15 to 30 feet. I use white twister tails tipped with worm or minnopw for most success. My thoughts are to fish a little shallower than normal. I will plan on using same type of baits and presentations I am looking for ideas to help locate fish quicker, what patterns to use, where to start search? Thanks"
1215120,labsrus,2010-07-01 08:55:00,557,I am leaving in the morning to head up to Canada. Any ideas or thoughts would be welcome. I am probably going to start the search in the usualy spots that we hit in August. Need to look for weed growth to see if it is much different. Thanks

1215136,Fishing Traveler,2010-07-01 09:17:00,19,"I'm hearing from a number of places that things this year are all ahead of normal. So, you could be finding more of a mid summer pattern. I would suggest using your normal/confidence patterns. And as Larry Mac said, let the fish tell you what you want. Chris"
1216774,labsrus,2010-07-07 10:34:00,557,"OK thanks for the tips. Here is a quick report on our trip this past weekend Trolled and jigged in the normal mid August patterns with small success. Went to slightly shallower areas near deep water, 12 to 15 feet of water. Ended up catching all walleyes on deep diving stick baits. Tried a variety of presentations, colors and other baits. The best ones were fire tiger trolled 2.5 MPH. Used worm harness in a variety of colors and only caught panfish. I did work a couple of spots with a jigging pattern, using night crawlers and twister tails. No luck with that at all this time out. Used white or yellow combinations. Water temps on the surface were in the low 70s. We had a lot of wind while we were there."
