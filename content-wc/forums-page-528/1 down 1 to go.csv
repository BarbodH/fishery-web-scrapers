Every single detail is taken care of and the people are VERY friendly. The owner and his wife are very accommodating, the wait staff was excellent, the guides were knowledgeable, the pilots for fly-outs are safe and friendly, and you pay for every bit of it. The lakes are capable of producing some absolutely monsterous fish, maybe even a world record Lake Trout some day. They have a legit 60 pounder hanging on the wall in the lodge. Our group caught several 40 inch plus pike and there was a 48"" and 47 1/2"" pike caught the week we visited. About 40 guests were in the lodge and I would guess half of them caught 40 inch plus pike. I on the other hand fished my butt off and the biggest pike I caught was 37"" so I was a little disappointed. Food was very good, accommodations were great, bugs weren't bad, weather didn't cooperate much but of course that isn't the outfitters fault. What I didn't like was that the main lake is 45 degrees and doesn't get much warmer than that according to my guide. What this means is that for the pike fishing you have to go to large bay areas that warm up and for the most part this means a 1 hour boat ride or you can of course book a fly-out. The first day we had very heavy winds so we all fished a river very near the camp and caught lots of average sized walleye. I realize that I haven't mentioned shore lunches which were an absolute highlight of the trip. If you go to Wollaston ask your guide to cook a shore lunch for you every day as opposed to the box lunches which you can opt for. The shore lunches were the best eating I've had in a very long time. For those of you that told me to go catfishing with City Cats in Winnipeg (because we had one full day there before heading up to Wollaston) I have one word for you BRILLIANT. Todd Longley the guide for City Cats is a little ""eccentric"" I'll say, but he knows how and where to catch giant channel cats. We caught 19 fish I think, two of them were Manitoba Master anglers >34 inches, and many of them were in the 30 inch range. Todd has very good equipment, a good sense of humor, and was very nice to the kids we had along with us. If you are ever in Winnipeg, book a trip with this guy. So two weeks from now I head to Lake Abamassagi and I'll give you a report after that trip as well."
