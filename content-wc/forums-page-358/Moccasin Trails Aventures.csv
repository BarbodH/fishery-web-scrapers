2043874,muskymatt,2013-08-20 18:09:00,1,Looking for some data on Moccasin Trails Adventures in northern Ontratio. Our group spends most of our time on the water fishing for big Pike and are always looking for new lakes to try. This outfitter seems to have some remote lakes which is normally a plus. The last post I saw on Moccasin was from 2004.
