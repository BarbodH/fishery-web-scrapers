I very rarely take anything over the slot size, but if I do, it becomes a bit more difficult to break the neck as the bones are bigger. With those fish, I bleed them out by slipping a filleting knife through there gills....or I wack them on the head with a pvc pipe I keep in the boat."

2047081,tuiflies,2013-08-21 16:39:00,158,I disagree. I used to work a lot with the Conservation Officers in NWO and found the non-compliant anglers were few and far between. They often have road checks that result in 90-95% compliance. Even the non-compliant anglers were most often what I would call ethically minded and just made a mistake through ignorance or a failure to check for the specifics of their area or lake. In the 4 years that I worked with the CO's I would say there were maybe half a dozen each year that were trying to get away with something they knew was illegal.
2048250,tv4fish,2013-08-22 06:29:00,2694,tuiflies: Thanks for your post. (I feel a little better now about the ethics of most fishermen).
2048306,MrSimon,2013-08-22 06:44:00,922,That's good to hear. I certainly hope that is the case.
2054426,Guest,2013-08-24 12:50:00,0,"The regulations for Lac Seul is as follows: Walleye and sauger - none between 46-53 cm (18.1-20.9 in.), not more than 1 greater than 53 cm (20.9 in.). No person may possess any live fish taken by angling other than bait-fish. If the Conservation Officers or cops (who are deemed to be Conservation Officers under the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act) happen across a live fish (gill movement etc etc), it means the seizure of your catch, a substantial fine, and possibly the seizure of your boat, and fishing equipment (anything that is party to the offence). This could also mean your boat trailer and truck to. The rule is in place to prevent the classic 'trading-up' for bigger fish under or over the slot size. As a local who fishes Lac Seul religously (60+ times on the water in 2012) and so far 30+ times this year, it keeps the fishery healthy."
2054850,v-bay gord,2013-08-24 16:18:00,3168,Hmm....I think the draconian fines and confiscations you cite are likely reserved for serious fish and game violators...not the poor sod who happens to have a twitching walleye on ice in a cooler.
2056594,walleyeduran,2013-08-25 13:22:00,286,"In watching the walleye neck breaking video, is it legal to cull fish on Eagle lake. Technically that is what the gentleman was doing by throwing those walleyes back in the water."
2056626,v-bay gord,2013-08-25 13:36:00,3168,"I hadn't watched the video till you pointed it out....thanks. On most every lake it is not illegal to have fish in a live well. Lac Seul is an exception. That said, I found the video to be a good reason to not allow the use of a live well, and the ultimate culling of fish. I didn't like the cavalier attitude of long bombing them over the side.... There is a process coming up for Eagle Lake (a fisheries regulation review) which might be a good time to propose something similar for Eagle Lake."
2056922,Guest,2013-08-25 15:32:00,0,"As far as I know, there is no issue with having fish in a live well.....as long as they are dead. Your correct in the draconian fines. I haven't seen it in action, but the legislation gives the C.O's the power if required to inflict some serious damage to the pocket book. I have seen a fella from Southern Ontario get a massive fine $25000(or something to that effect) for having 50 Rainbow trout in his possession when the limit was 1. (Lake Superior tributary). I believe the rules are in place to keep people honest. Yes, there may be a few fisherman who deliberately flaunt the regs, but as a whole, walleye fisherman go out to enjoy the time on the water, and release plenty of fish in healthy condition for future generations to enjoy the great fishery that Lac Seul has to offer."
2035074,adempsey,2013-08-16 18:51:00,963,"No, I was just saying I was surprised at the Lac Seul regulation because in general you can cull fish on other lakes in Ontario. I realize that you cannot do that on Lac Seul [or Minnitaki]. Not being allowed to possess live fish is a strange regulation if you ask me and I can't say I understand it, but it is what it is. Especially on only two lakes out of thousands in the province.I may live in Ontario, but those lakes are probably closer to you than they are to me"
2035162,v-bay gord,2013-08-16 19:27:00,3168,The MNR is sending out a mixed message.......on one hand it's o.k. to cull (I'm sure this is for purposes of running a tournament).....yet on Lac Seul not. It is logical to assume that culling would have risks of mortality.....and should not be endorsed or promoted.
2035674,tv4fish,2013-08-17 06:18:00,2694,"I think it's quite understandable and I am in favor of it - it's a way to prevent fish from being killed while the fish are kept in a live well. Picture 3 guys fishing in a boat and they have their limit of walleyes and northerns and bass in a live-well and they just want to keep fishing and try to ""improve"" the size of the fish that they have kept. Chances are some of those fish that get ""tossed back"" as they are culling are not going to survive.I think it's a good regulation and perhaps should be instituted everywhere.You catch a fish - you decide right then and there to keep it or throw it back. IMO - if it gets released right away, it has a much better chance of survival."
2037066,Glenman12,2013-08-17 20:42:00,762,this is just me ....I have no problem filleting a fish that is still alive...not sure I could boink one on the head or break his neck..glad I don't fish Lac Suel...
2039297,MrSimon,2013-08-19 07:03:00,922,"I can see where they are going with the whole ""don't cull a fish and release it just to die"" thing ..... but I can't help but wonder if a lot of fish get killed and wasted that could have been released. For example, I've had lots of times when I have a fish or two in the well and decide it isn't enough for a meal .... I release them and they swim away happy as can be. I suppose its possible they will die later, but at least they have a chance. Killing them right away doesn't even give them a chance. We've also had times when we had a full box of fish only to find out the other boat came back to camp with just as many. We release six or seven fish because we don't need them. Again, if we had been forced to kill them, they would have most likely been wasted. I wonder how many dead fish get thrown back in the lake or thrown in a trash can because of these regs."
2040097,stumcfar,2013-08-19 10:31:00,451,"It is by all means a law and not a ""camp rule"". They do get picky about it too. I have talked with groups in the evening that got ticketed in McKenzie Bay for having fish, not dead, in the cooler. It's not a big deal. Whack them on the head and comply!"
2040169,kzoofisher,2013-08-19 11:27:00,5144,"Odd that these lakes should have a rule so different from the rest of the province. Anybody know the hidtory of it? When did it first go into effect, was it pushed by locals, was ther an issue with people dumping fish? It's an extreme way to solve a problem so I'm guess there's more to this than meets the eye."

I would speculate that a lot more are wasted by poor catch and release (including releasing fish at the end of the day because you had too many). I don't know too many ethical anglers who would toss perfectly good fish into the garbage without either just freezing their excess or giving it to someone else.
2041890,MrSimon,2013-08-20 06:29:00,922,"I think you are overestimating how ethical the general population of fishermen are. Over the years, I have found them to be good decent hard working folks .... but they tend not to be conservation minded and give little to no thought about waste, over-harvesting, C&R, and things like that. Rule following is also not very high on their priority list. We often forget that the on-line angling community (like here on WC) is only a small fraction of the overall angling community. And the mind-set of guys who spend their off-water time on-line talking about fishing tend to care more about things like rules, waste, over-harvest etc."
2041946,tv4fish,2013-08-20 06:51:00,2694,WOW: That's a pretty cynical comment - and I sure hope it is NOT accurate.
2032322,115 optimax,2013-08-15 21:02:00,650,I think he meant to say it is an Ontario Reg on Lac Seul not to have live fish in the boat.If that's not what you meant you are 110 % wrong...
2032922,nitrodude,2013-08-16 07:21:00,60,Here are the current Zone 4 regs. Pay particular attention to page 3 of the PDF:http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodcons...nr_e001324.pdf

Especially considering you can cull fish.Quote: Originally Posted by Ontario MNR Regs 2013Generally, daily catch limits include all fish that are retained for any period of time and not immediately released.Anglers fishing from a boat may catch, hold, and selectively live release more walleye, northern pike, largemouth or smallmouth bass than the daily limit, provided:(a) the fish are held in a livewell with a mechanical aerator operating at all times (see Anglers Guide, page 8, for livewell requirements),(b) the fish comply with any applicable size limits,(c) the Sport or Conservation Fishing Licence daily catch and retain limits for walleye or northern pike are not exceeded at any one time,(d) no more than six largemouth or smallmouth bass (or any combination) caught under a Sport Fishing Licence are retained at any one time, and(e) the Conservation Fishing Licence catch and retain limits for largemouth and smallmouth bass (or any combination) are not exceeded at any one time.Anglers are reminded to closely monitor the condition of fish held in a livewell. Only fish that are in such a condition that they will survive may be released (see Tips on Live Release of Fish, page 10). Releasing a fish that will not survive and allowing the flesh of that fish to be wasted is an offence. Any fish not live-released are part of your catch limit and your possession limit."

2034410,Red legs,2013-08-16 14:54:00,27,It is a very specific regulation on Lac Seul that no live fish may be in possession. Possession means longer than to measure and take a picture. One of our group was ticketed one year for having a walleye in the ice chest alive. The CPO kindly informed us of the reg and showed how to break necks quickly. Breaking necks is the ONLY sure way to do this. I have clubbed fish in past only to find them belly up with gills pumping. FYI this is considered ALIVE per CPO. We keep a small towel handy for this task.
2034498,MikeinMN,2013-08-16 15:19:00,190,"The group I fish with has fished Lac Seul for several years now. We kill the fish we keep by turning them onto their backs and locating the dark spot along the center line of their white belly within an inch or so of the gills. This dark spot is easy to find if you look. We insert a short, sharp, narrow bladed knife into this dark spot and twist it. The fish bleeds out very quickly satisfying the Lac Seul kill law and it leaves nice, clean, white fillets at cleaning time. I'm not sure if any other method of killing a fish adds to length or not, but I am sure this one does not."
2034554,MassillonBuckeye,2013-08-16 15:33:00,661,How are you folks certain that hitting it just doesn't cause more harm and not kill it? Or any other method you use to kill it other than bled out. That's not painful? Very poorly thought out regulation. I'm really glad I'm not a fisherman up in that neck of the woods. While I applaud the concern for the fish but this seems very ill advised. I've definitely cracked fish on te skull enough times to know it doesn't always kill them. Also: fish dont have necks. Brutal to mandate this!!
2034674,SinOrSwim,2013-08-16 16:11:00,1528,"What is the difference whether you keep them alive or not? Hitting it on the head might be painful but then again if you are cleaning the fish, jamming a knife into it's side and cutting off half the fish while it's alive can't feel great? Just curious what you do.Also, not sure on the whole bleeding out thing. Isn't your cooler just a big pool of cold blood at the end of the day??? yuck"
2035050,Sooner fan,2013-08-16 18:39:00,6,"All lakes have their own regulations, but on Minnitaki Lake NO fish KEPT are allowed to be alive.

A couple minutes later they have bled out and we put them on ice. NO blood when you clean them."

2031114,jimmie,2013-08-15 11:25:00,123,"Actually it is an Ontario reg to not have live fish in your boat. This is to prevent culling out smaller ones and replace with bigger fish. Most die when you return them to thier habitat after long periods of time in live well or on a stringer. I had a cpl guys give me a 27"" walleye from Minnitaki while I was near them and I said no thanks but was left as temporary guardian. I spent the next 45 minutes reviving the female and she swam away. They were locals too but had hooked it deep and evidently never considered cutting the line amnd releasing thuis fish producer safely. I do not keep fish so I do not fish deeper than 25 feet and that is a seldom event for me. And when they bite I puill on them to set the hook right away. Never lost more than a perch since 1976 when I kept and cleaned my last fish. I enjoy a great shorelunch as much as the next guy but live in Minnesota so I can catch dinner at home if I want. I love catching any fish but am partial to smallies which i would not eat anyway. Besides not have a live well to keep even dead fish in I want to be able to return for many years to catch more fish and hopefully a bigger one than in the past. I have caught 28 1?2"" eyes in less than 5' of water and many over 25"" in the shallows. Caught 20 1/2"" smallie in 4"" with crawler and boobber. Caught pike in 3/4/45' of water that were all over 36"" one just short of trophy at 39 1/2""in two feet!!! Heading back up to give it another try next week so hopw to have a fish story or two to share when i get back. Be afe and enjoy the bueaty of the Northwoods. Try the park if you get a chance for smallies. pike and Musky. Less than $10 for day pass and it's on the honor system. No motors before 8am as the launch is close to the campground. If you stay on the lake and at one of the resorts I do not believe that you are limited as to how early you can start. Fish don't usually wake up before that too often anyway lol!!"
2031186,MrSimon,2013-08-15 12:01:00,922,"I don't think that is true. If it really is a law, I've certainly never heard of it. I have been checked by Conservation Officers and they had no issue with us having live fish in the well. It is common practice to keep live fish on a stringer or in a live well until its time to clean them. But to the OP, if you are willing to hook a fish through the mouth, make it fight for its life, yank it out of the water, and eat it .... then you really shouldn't have a problem with whacking it over the head to give it a quick clean death."
2031218,tv4fish,2013-08-15 12:34:00,2694,"That is not a true statement - You need to check the individual regulations, not only for the different zones with in Ontario, but also the ""special"" regs. for each lake. In Lac Seul, you cannot have a live game fish on your boat.Lac Seul, including Broad, Sunlight, Root River, Vaughan (Whitefish Lake) and Lost Lakes, and Wenasaga River from the first rapids upstream from Lac Seul approx. 3 km downstream to the last group of islands.Walleye and sauger - none between 46-53 cm (18.1-20.9 in.), not more than 1 greater than 53 cm (20.9 in.).

2031226,Woollybob,2013-08-15 12:35:00,158,It is regulation for Lac Seul. I do it everywhere now - best way to have nice white fillets. Cut the 'throat' - put your knife through the bottom of both gills an cut down through the small spot where the belly connects to the head. Then break the neck - pull head back (make sure you are pointed out of the boat) - you will see a nice squirt of blood. Throw in a cooler. By the time you clean them they will be bled out and have nice white fillets.

We always stop one short of our limit so that we can't go over if we get one in the gills. Once you put a fish in the live well it's part of your limit whether you cull it or not and I'd rather play it safe than take a chance on inadvertently breaking the law."

When I spoke with Andrea at GB when planning my first trip, I mentioned that the reason I'd never considered LS before was because I didn't want to kill the fish I'd keep. And I remember her response was something to the effect of, ""That's not a problem. We'll give you a cooler with a block of ice and all you have to do is put your fish in the cooler."" Maybe that's not exactly what she said, but that's the message I heard. So for my three LS trips, that's just what I did - I'd throw my dinner fish in the cooler and they'd flop around for 15 minutes or so. By the time I got back to camp, they'd be dead and the ice seemed to keep them fresh.After reading some older posts, I now understand that I missinterpreted Andrea's instructions, and I was actually supposed to whack them over the head or somehow break their necks before putting them in the cooler. That was the point of my original objection, I don't want to whack the fish over the head. I guess I've been lucky that I haven't been checked.Anyway, now that I understand the regulation. What's the best way to do the deed? Do you carry a small bat and whack them? A guy I know told me I'm supposed to break their necks. How do you break a walleye's neck?"

They just slowly die. Granted, I don't have any idea if they feel pain or not? Flipside is if we use stringers on different lakes or a live well, we don't feel bad jamming a knife into their neck to clean it while it's alive."
