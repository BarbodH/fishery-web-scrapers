1992201,stumcfar,2013-07-30 07:48:00,451,I am considering a last minute trip the end of August to Lac Seul. I have always fished the NW area in June. Are we going to have to run all the way to McKenzie Bay to find fish that time of year? This would be the first time bringing my wife up there and not sure if we would want to make that long boat ride each day. Any suggestions and advice would be greatly appreciated.

Everyone was going to MacKenzie Bay, but we went there only one day. We caught a ton of fish right by where we stayed, all on artificials, a lot within sight of Goose Bay Camp, where we stayed. I would suspect those fish will still be there. The fish were good sized, too. A lot over 20 and many 24-25; I would say the grass is not always greener on the other side.We have the same experience on Lake of the Woods as well. Boats travel 15-20 miles each day to catch walleyes and muskies and we catch most of our fish within sight of the camp we stay at and have an easy day, taking a break at lunch."

1997522,Bucky Goldstein,2013-08-01 02:59:00,3,I am in the same boat. I have only fished the NW section in July but we are going to try an early September trip this year.I just got back from NW section. We were there during the crappy cold front from July 24-28. We fished Steamboat the whole time. There were plenty of eaters and nice fish caught there. We'll be winging it like you...our first day will be a half day so I won't go any farther than Steamboat and it should give us a good idea of how that will be...but I won't hesitate to run to Mckenzie everyday if it seems necessary.

We saw the northern lights and one morning had a hard frost. The lake fishing was good but not great. It didn't seem to matter how far one traveled. It was moving water that held fish. The flowing portion of the lake produced the best fish with after dark off the dock being the best. We hammered 20-26"" fish until our fingers froze. We also caught in a couple good northern 34 and 38 inchers. We lost a couple eyes at the boat with tails the size of my hand. I'm pretty sure these fish were 28-30 inchers. I believe that those who go to canada to relax and enjoy have a much better trip than those intent on having 100 fish days every day."
2004409,2746,2013-08-04 08:55:00,3206,Couldn't agree more. There is a lot more to visiting a Canadian lake than counting the number of fish one catches.
2004873,BreezyPoint,2013-08-04 13:19:00,1581,"I agree about relaxing on a trip. Next year will mark my 50th anniversary of trips to Canada. I caught a zillion fish of all sizes and now just love the 'entire package', not just the fishing. I could get skunked and still have a great day on the water!"

I just finished a week on the English River below Manitou Falls and stopped by Goose Bay Camp on the way home to finalize our booking for next year and see some of the improvements Andrea is making to the camp.I talked to a bear hunter who is doing some casual fishing and he told me he was catching all of the walleyes he ever wanted right in Goose Bay in sight of camp, so I do think you don't always need to travel far to catch fish, even at this time of the year."
