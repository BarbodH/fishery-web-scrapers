2068858,Tylumps,2013-08-29 17:15:00,73,"Normally 7-8 guys on a 6 nighter is a 700 walleye week. This year we had 5 adults and 3 young men ages 6,9,11. We had 1100 walleye. It was crazy. We had a saying this year A.D.E.D Stands for ""All Day Every Day."" Had a blast and we dealt with a serious cold front in July that did not effect fishing at all. Friends of mine around Detroit that haven't been always complain they will never go because we bring home only 2 fish per man. But catching walleye like blue gills in a pond is something you just can't do on Erie, Saint Clair or Saginaw Bay. Take Care All"
2071137,btmbncr,2013-08-30 19:04:00,492,"My approach to walleye fishing has changed in the last two years.I'm more interested in catching and releasing big walleyes rather than numbers.I focus my ""hunting"" on a little deeper structure with big fish in mind.Somedays we just looking for eaters.I really don't know how many walleyes we catch in a week.By we I'm saying my wife and myself.Bill"
2072090,Iowa Hawkeye,2013-08-31 09:25:00,90,"I don't even tell anyone how many fish we catch on NE Lac Suel anymore, they don't believe us. We have had many days where if you didn't have a fish on in three jigs, you knew your minnow was gone. Wish I was sitting at Three Sisters right now!"
2076473,drlee,2013-09-02 11:50:00,409,"Interesting thread. I don't typically count fish. I also would put in this qualifier: I usually drift with a jig and minnow or crawler so I don't sit on a school very often...just personal preference. That being said: The third week in June, lightly fished drive in lake, good walleye chop with lots of rain all week, 2 guys in each boat, total walleyes (only) = just over 1,000. Best year ever, I think. Second example: Lightly fished drive in lake, but, last week in July, first week in August. Fishing solo. Fish on deep reefs and more scattered. I kept a journal for two weeks just for fun and part of that was counting fish. I averaged a little over 30 walleyes per day, solo. I had one legit 100 fish day, the same area for about 6-7 hours. Time of year matters."
2066482,Red legs,2013-08-28 20:06:00,27,"This is hard number to quantify. I've been going to Lac Seul the same week for 24 years. We maximize our time on the water. Some trips with perfect weather and conditions we have had some 300 fish / man days. This is a long day 10-12 hours. These kind of days are rare. We have not had any of these since the fires. We usually did this casting light jigs to weeds in shade usually not too far from camp. Since the fire shade is a rare commodity in our neck of the woods( NE section) a 200 fish day is excellent with 125-150 fish day the norm. Usually fish three guys to boat so 375-600 fish per day over 10-12 hours. There have been trips we boat 3000 fish /boat for the week. One trip in particular about ten years ago we had a two boat tourney at dusk 100 yards from houseboat and two boats with five men between them caught 125 fish in one hour casting 1/16 jigs tipped with leech into weed edge. This was three adults and two teenagers. The boat with three in it caught 65. The other boat 60. We were both using clickers to track the fish caught. The fish caught were mostly 16-17 inches with a couple over 20 per boat. All these fish were beak hooked and released unharmed. We fish hard, play the wind and weather and have structured milk runs that produce good numbers and lately big fish. This lake is incredible and if you get on fish early the numbers can be phenomenal because the fish are usually very pattern predictable. If I were putting an average day/ man I would say 100-125/ man-day in recent years. The fish have been bigger better quality. My personal best is 33 incher caught several years ago. This year we caught 150 in boat over 25 inches for the week. We had 2 over 30 inches."
2067034,MrSimon,2013-08-29 07:14:00,922,"Some of the numbers in this thread are straight up mind boggling. It just goes to show how ridiculously good the walleye fishing can be in Northern Ontario. I fish in Canada a lot, but I don't jig. I also don't seek out schools of walleye and sit on top of them all day catching one after another. We really prefer to move around a lot and cast lures at structure and cover. We like to cover water and ""see the sights"". We usually catch more bass and pike than walleye. Using that approach, on a given day, per guy, here is how we break it down: Less than 10 fish per day = poor fishing 10-20 fish per day = solid fishing, no complaints 20-30 fish per day = smok'n good day, pumped up 30 or more fish per day = Insanely good, high fives everywhere I'd say we average about 15 per day per guy. Usually around 100 fish per week per guy. This might seem like low numbers to you jigg'n maniacs out there, but we have no complaints."
2067234,2746,2013-08-29 08:09:00,3206,"Just to put this spectacular performance into context, 300 fish per 10 hour day would be 30 fish/hour or 1 fish every 2 minutes for 10 hours straight with no breaks for anything..... 200 fish for 10 hours would be 1 fish every 3 minutes.....again with no time for breaks to move, eat etc. fishing a 12 hour day would change the numbers only slightly."
2067330,tv4fish,2013-08-29 08:27:00,2694,"And, in my book, THAT is pretty darn ..................amazing."
2067362,oleJoe,2013-08-29 08:39:00,114,Its all good fishing and just great to be able to do it. We do fly-ins and with 6 of us it usually come out to 1500 to 1800 pike and walleyes. We don't fish near as hard as we use to or as long but I enjoy it more every year and look forward to next year. Just be thankful you got enough for supper. LOL
2067498,Mike Kansas,2013-08-29 09:13:00,1463,"Have had that kind of fishing in short periods but not all day. THAT would be a heck of a day. I will say that we had the best year we ever had in 30 years on Lac Seul this year. Right at 3,000 Walleye for 6 of us in 6 days. They were stacked for us in 3' to 7' of water all week in early June. It can be done but it is rare for us. Mike Kansas"
2067770,tv4fish,2013-08-29 10:22:00,2694,"Red and Mike: You guys keep posting stuff like this and you're going to have some ""guiding requests"" coming your way.........."
2067794,Mike Kansas,2013-08-29 10:32:00,1463,Does that mean I should not tell about the 20 fish days we have? Mike Kansas
2068194,Red legs,2013-08-29 13:01:00,27,"I don't mean to imply 300 fish days happen often-they are rare( maybe 3 in 24 years), but I have been in on some of them. When you fish weeds you don't fight the fish long and your lines are short. Usually in under 10 feet depth more pitching than casting. So it's not impossible to catch a fish per minute. I know I don't catch 60/ hour, but its not unrealistic to catch 30 or more in an hour.You have to see it to believe it. Like I said the average is probably more on the line of 125-150 / day. That number is easy to obtain if you fish 10-12 hours per day which we do. We take a 30 minute break mid day for sandwich when we make our milk runs. If we are doing shore lunch we take an hour. We fish..... That's what we come to the best walleye lake in the world for. We don't drink and we only play cards when weather dictates no fishing. We stay on a house boat and stay in an area centrally located in some of the best fishing in the NE quadrant of Lac Seul. So we don' have to run far to be on large numbers of fish. A 50 fish day is a poor day. The trip is not about numbers though. It's about being in God's country and amongst great friends. The fish are a nice bonus."
2068282,Mike Kansas,2013-08-29 13:29:00,1463,Well stated Redlegs. May you have many more days like you have described. I agree when shortline fishing you can hook and handle a lot of fish in one hour. As you well know Lac Seul is the place to do it. Mike Kansas
2062353,Mike Kansas,2013-08-27 12:07:00,1463,"Curiosity has the best of me. When you go to Canada Walleye fishing what would be the average number of Walleye you personally catch PER WEEK based on your last 5 years in Canada. I realize that the number of fish is not the most important way to measure a succesfull trip but I'm just curious of what kind of numbers the WC gang catchs. Thanks, Mike Kansas"
2062401,Gregking,2013-08-27 12:17:00,2658,"5 hrs of fishing per day (dad needs lots of rest) @ say 5 per hr would be one every 12 minutes. So maybe 175 walleye. Usually that number includes a storm which then shuts down fishing after however hours before the storm is really good so its a balance.Its a hard number to come up with, lots of things to try and remember. Now that I think about it those are this years number which are about half of what we normally do so maybe 300. Trying to eliminate bass, perch and Northern out of my memory. Never really though about it much at all. IDK call it 250-300 something like that."
2062521,Kansas Bound,2013-08-27 12:55:00,152,Enough to get lunch and toss a few back. 5-10 a day
2062529,Mr. Sauger,2013-08-27 12:58:00,285,"Hmmm, let’s see.About half of our Lac Seul trips I would call good weeks with about 210 wallies per man. Other trips might be 50-75% of that. 2 fisherman per boat, 6 full days fishin plus 2 shorter travel/packing days fishing DAY - Fish per boatHalf day - 101 - 50 2 - 503 - 1004 - 1005 - 506 - 50Half day - 10 TOTAL 420 wallies per 2 per boat = 210 walleye per man per week We don’t usually keep count, but do on some occasions (proving 100 fish days to a newby, reporting hot spots to another boat, etc.)"
2062561,jimirjr,2013-08-27 13:04:00,1149,"Well, Houseboat trip on LOW the first year We had No CLUE what We were doing... 6 days, 3 Guys, 40-50 Eyes. Maybe 20 Pike. Second, Third, Fourth, Etc... We figured it out and 4 Guys in 9 Days We figured about 800 Eyes total...PLUS numerous PIKE.Last Fall was an EPIC battle..... bad wind, rain, etc... 3 Guys, 9 days, 200 Eyes."
2062897,packpro,2013-08-27 14:56:00,695,"This year, 30 miles north of Vermillion Bay. Last week of June.2 fishermen in my boat. These are boat totals. 8 hours of fishing 85% will be walleyes with pike and perch mixed in. No smallies, but they are available as well as Lake Trout. We just don't target the smallies, muskies, or LT.Day#1 32 fish. First day on this part of the systemDay #2 55 fish. Very Familiar stretch if water Day #3 104 fish. Very remote portage- lake better sizeDay #4 35 fish Combination of day one an day two spots.Day #5 23 fish ALL PIKE. walleye skunked. Severe lightning storm that morning and the night before. Fished all the exact same spots as previous and a few new ones.Day #6 100 fish in 9 hours. One 28"" walleye as the sun was behind the clouds for an extended period. Short portage from main lake.Day #7 Bonus day. 19 fish. Experiment day, Switched from Minnows to worms. Tried new areas, ended early to pack up. Hope this helps."
2063417,pan-man,2013-08-27 17:53:00,299,"I have kept track for numerous trips in last 10 years (about 20 trips). I count only fish that I would be able to clean with a conscious (walleyes 12"" or bigger, perch 10"" or bigger, northern 24"" or bigger, and small mouth 12"" or bigger).My opinion for a 10-12 hour fishing day is:poor-25 fish/man/dayaverage-40 fish/man/daygood - 50 fish/man/daygreat -65 fish/man/day"
2063498,tlars,2013-08-27 18:39:00,137,My wife and I fishing 7 hours per day mostly in big fish spots on Lac Seul - about 40 walleyes per day plus a few bonus pike.
2063690,KTroller,2013-08-27 19:35:00,237,I'm gonna say 150 per guy per week. That is defining a week as 6-1/2 days fishing. 1/2 day or less on the first day (usually Sat) and a whole day Sun-Fri. Feels like it should be more but it is always fun.KT
2065786,Freytown,2013-08-28 15:27:00,770,"I never counted fish that I caught, only counted what I put in the freezer for the trip home. I do know that when I visit the north country, I always catch way more than back home...that's it and I'm happy."
