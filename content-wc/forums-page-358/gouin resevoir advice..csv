2066314,mr limit,2013-08-28 19:08:00,17,i am getting ready to book a trip to Nemio Outfitters on the Gouin Resevoir next week.Since Ive never been to Canada before Id like to know When would be the best time to go.If i go in May or early june I might be able to find walleyes in the river or would I be better off waiting until July or August as the fish will be on more predictable spotsin deeper water.Also if i go later will bugs be less of a problem.Thanksfor your help.

As for bugs bring spray that has 100% deet,the hatch is differant every year"

I fished it once when the water level was 12 ft. low. The maps i bought were useless because where it showed water there was sand. We had to walk to the camp about 200yrds. I remember asking the pilot , why the **** did they put the camp so far away from the water. BUT.....The fishing was tremendous , we caught so many walleyes i got to say i got sick of it. There was places you could not get a jig to the bottom because they would grab it before it ever reached bottom.We flew ot of St Micheles De Saints with Cargair outfitters. This is a top notch outfitter and very reliable. I have uses these guys several times.We stayed in camp #8 in the east bay portion of the resiviour.Best of luck fishing........Watch out for the bears , they were all around our camp."

Makes finding the fish a bit more challenging but that's part of the fun. As someone else said, the best rivers ""Spawning Areas"" are closed to fishing until June 1. You can fish outside the areas. They are well marked."
