2049722,poultryman,2013-08-22 14:00:00,183,"Ive had a few weeks to reflect on a long fishing vacation. Only had two days of guiding over 14 days of fishing. I thought I would see what sort of reaction the forum folks would have about my guide experience.Day one with guide A. : Guide brought us to the first walleye spot, he caught the first fish and into the livewell for lunch. Moved two spots and finally put us on the fish, caught lunch and plenty of 14-17 inch fish. Maybe boated 20 fish for the boat. After lunch was in the livewell, the guide stopped fishing and made sure the three of us, including an 11 year old, were doing great. Fixed the 11 year old's reel problems with line twist, baited all hooks, netted and unhooked all the fish that needed attention. Cooked a fantastic shorelunch over a wood fire, even if it took nearly 2 hours, and was gracious and funny. I tipped $100. Didn't catch many pike in the afternoon as that was what we targeted, but still put a couple in the boat.A couple of days later went out for Musky with guide B. : Guide B. brought three walleye rods and two musky rods with him. One musky rod had the ""special lure"" a red and gold bucktail with a copper blade and the other had a purple and white cisco colored bucktail on it. Both about #7 or #8 blades. Stopped at the first musky spot and Guide B's son came up and he gave him the second Musky rod with the cisco bucktail on it for Son's girlfriend who had forgotten her musky rod. Guide B. proceeds to the front of the boat and drops the trolling motor in the water and takes the shotgun spot at the bow of the 18 foot G3 boat. Guide B. proceeds to fish first and gets a couple of follows and strikes from some decent sized fish. Then Guide B. gets a follow on the biggest musky Ive ever seen. Mammoth. No sniffs from the three of us. We were throwing everything in the tackle box. Had a couple of kinda similar cowgirls and one mepps #5 in red and copper blades. No luck. Guide decides to stop and walleye fish at a spot he knows, great spot, no luck. Burned an hour and many holes in the water trying to find the ""hump"". No GPS in the boat. No marker buoys. Just turning circles in the wind trying to find the spot. Mind you, this was a musky day. Both my son and I stopped fishing because there were no nibbles. Finally after about an hour of futility he says ""Well, is it time to fish for the big girls again?"" Um, yes. After gulping down some bad sandwiches from the lodge (sliced ham and american cheese on white with mayo and butter and only one sandwich) we hit the fourth musky spot. BANG. Guide B. lands a nice 42 inch musky. Guide B commands ME to ""get the net"". Ok. I net his fish. Guide B. then commands ""Get my camera from my bag"". Ok. So I take a photo of Guide B. with his musky with his camera. Guide B. then asks us, ""What did both the big musky and the caught musky have in common?"" Well, apart from the fact that they were both following and hitting on your lure, he says that they were both caught off of rocks at the entrance to a shallow bay. Great! So the rest of the day we didnt fish the mouth of a single shallow bay. Well, we did, but not until the absolute last 20 minutes of the day. Guide B FINALLY hands over the ""Magic Special Lure from God"" to my fishing partner. Oh, and he offers that he has another one just like it in a double cowgirl if I want to use it. Nah. Im good. By this time Im just not happy with the guy. I find a bucktail thats about the right size in my box, its a brown, yellow and gold #7 blade Buchertail. Sparkly like the magic lure. I finally get a strike off of a rock wall. Probably a 30 inch fish or so. I miss the hookset. But at least I dont feel skunked! My fishing partner misses a hookset with the Magic Lure on a mammoth Musky. My 11 year old didnt get a bite all day. I throw on a cisco colored white and purple double 10 cowgirl. I catch a 28 inch pike as soon as it hits the water. That was my fish for the day. Last possible cast on a black and black double 10 cowgirl I have a good sized musky swirl and miss the strike. The sunny bright sky had just turned overcast about 10 minutes earlier. And at the mouth of a bay. Off of some rocks. :sSo, all in all, I was disappointed. Now, I didnt stiff the guy. $60 tip. Not great, but not terrible either. He definitely put us on the fish. There were most definitely some incredible musky in the water and we were moving fish and put one in the boat. But my problem was not necessarily that the guide was fishing, Im actually fine with that, but not from the front of the boat and if he has insider knowledge of the fishery, perhaps loaning out his magic lure or maybe going through my boxes to see what might work well would have been a good idea. Or at the very least giving the client the benefit of the doubt. Ive had guided trips where the guide would hook a big pike or musky and immediately hand his pole to the kid on the boat so that the kid could reel in a big fish. Get the net.Get my camera.Yeah...not sure Im going back there.Thoughts? It felt like I was just along for the ride while the guide practiced his musky fishing rather than him working to put us on the fish. That just doesn't seem quite right. Oh, and I will add that the price for the guide was $200 per day paid to the lodge."
2049754,Juls,2013-08-22 14:09:00,13414,"Guide B definitely did not make your day as fun as it could have been, and that's his job. I would not have been happy with him either."
2049802,poultryman,2013-08-22 14:18:00,183,"Let me amend my question beyond just thoughts... What is the best way or how should a client approach a day with a guide to ensure that the guide understands what you want to do that day? Especially for people who are not avid fishermen. What about the guide taking up the valuable position on the front casting deck of the boat? With 4 people fishing on an 18 foot boat, its a bit cramped already. With the guide's 4 or 5 rods back by the tiller, there wasnt much room to fish back there for the client. How much fishing should be expected by the guide? Should that be agreed upon before leaving the dock? Are there unwritten rules or anything like that that might be helpful to know?"
2049930,v-bay gord,2013-08-22 15:03:00,3168,"Guide B needs a professional make-over. Running the trolling motor in the bow seems logical to get the boat in the location it needs to be.....but the customers should be given first shot. Clutter in the boat? Should be taken care of....maybe move the rods to the bow for the guide to trip over. Bottom line is now you know what to ask for in terms of a guide...either as a recommendation from others, or when hiring through a lodge. Can he fit your requirements....and it isn't just about finding fish. Step two is to let the lodge know your concerns...what was right and what wasn't. They may only hear that big fish were seen and all is good........time to give them some feed back for the next time. Maybe even a friendly conversation with the guide if he seems able to handle constructive criticism.....some may just not realize these issues till pointed out. On the water, perhaps being a bit more assertive. Ask to use the hot lure. Cast into ""his"" prime water. It may not be subtle, but it's your day, your money.... .....after re-reading your post, I think I might have pulled the pin during the hour long search for the secret walleye spot and asked to be taken back to base.......there to renegotiate the guide wage with the lodge owner."
2052738,Bakefish,2013-08-23 14:58:00,1077,When you hire a guide through the lodge he is a direct reflection on that lodge. If they are hiring less than desirable guides they are not caring about the happiness of their customers. This is why I think that most of them would want you to inform them of a bad experience.
2052826,poultryman,2013-08-23 15:34:00,183,What if said Guide was helping to run the lodge and was sort of a de facto owner?
2052842,Bakefish,2013-08-23 15:40:00,1077,...and he was like the 2nd guy? Find a new lodge.
2052906,thyme to fish,2013-08-23 16:13:00,307,"guide has NO business bringing a ""4""th on a 18 footer.....#2 shouldnt be casting for the fish your casting for unless invited3 should have his boat in order before it hits the ramp or you untie....4 tip them for bad service,,,NEVER.....what did ""they"" learn if you tip them,,,,,ill tell you what they learned,,,to treat the next guy the same way...could get ""uncomfortable"" but at some point a WTF is in order.....i'd also say before i book the deal, I know how many are in the boat...as far as netting and camera,,,,,heck thats half the fun for me.........ill net the big girl"
2060474,Obabikon,2013-08-26 18:30:00,2370,"I can see both sides of this. A guide should always be ready to pass the rod to an 11 year old. ESPECIALLY when musky fishing. I guide quite a bit for musky (in the range of 30 days or so per year), and I'm usually asked to run the trolling motor so the guest can just fish. I always ""L"" towards the back of the boat, and I'm prepared to try to pull my lure away from fish. I can't tell you how many fish I've passed to guests. Once a fish is raised I stop fishing for quite a while. But, if I can't coach them to catch one, I'm going to try to get it one way or another. If asked not to fish, it's not a problem... a little boring, but I'm being paid to do a service. A good guide knows the ""spots on the spots"" and coaches you exactly where to land your lure. All that said, if a guide/owner isn't providing the service you're looking for, you have a responsibility to yourself to inform them. If you don't... then it's hard for them to get better. I would much rather a guest be blunt with me, and tell me what they expect... versus going to another resort. Good luck out there and keep your lines tight!"
2061233,DD73,2013-08-27 05:43:00,131,"I've taken at least 10 different guides out, on everything from Canadian Shield to flowages to weedy meso lakes. A number of those guides were very comfortable running the boat from the back. Some would fish from the front, but throw gliders when the fish were going on blades. I have no problem with either of those scenarios."
2061337,poultryman,2013-08-27 06:34:00,183,"Thanks everyone for the excellent, thoughtful responses. This place is fantastic! I guess what sort of got to me was the fact that there was one lure that was spot on, and the guide was using it and throwing from the front of the boat. He could have looked at my tackle box and picked something out, or maybe loaned out the lure, or perhaps just shut up and run the boat. When his lure was the only one getting follows and strikes, it made me realize that there might be something to his lure selection that we just couldnt match. Figures."
2062329,DD73,2013-08-27 11:57:00,131,"After spending months of time chasing muskies on Canadian waters and more pressured US waters, we have found that on less pressured water (Canada) the first bait through gets bit more often, all other things being equal. I live near heavily pressured musky water in the states, and here it doesn't matter nearly as much. But up north, yeah, first guy through more often than not is going to catch more fish."
2051610,SinOrSwim,2013-08-23 07:29:00,1528,"This is an interesting thread. I have never fished with a guide but we have one set up for our trip in a couple weeks. Really looking forward to it. Will be interesting to see how it goes. Might have to have some sort of competition? We have 14 in our group so there will be a few boats fishing in different areas without the guide and one follow boat with the guide. So, maybe the 4 people with the guide against the 10 people without?"
2051666,Shellback,2013-08-23 07:46:00,8083,Sounds like you paid for guide # 2's day of fishing. That would have been his tip for the day.
2051946,DD73,2013-08-23 08:57:00,131,"Fishing musky, you want the guide throwing baits. Just not in front of the customers.First guy through should be tossing most likely bait to get hit. The guy behind him is trying to find something that will work better. Some days the fish want a fast bucktail, other days, a slow dawg. Or topwater, etc. The more baits in the water, the more likely you are to dial in on what the fish are reacting to - type of bait, how it's moving, color, etc.If the guide is behind you and moving fish, it should be understood the clients should change up to do what the guide is doing to trigger fish. The best guides will take off a lure if they get a follow/fish on it and hand it to the person at the front of the boat if they're not moving anything."
2052002,octanehi5,2013-08-23 09:17:00,1104,"It sounds like you payed to take both guides out fishing,when you go out with a guide they never get to reel in the fish. Two hour shore lunch should be one hour at best, way to many people in the boat. You should have got a refund from the guide never mind the tip.The guides were not very courteous to you. I would let the outfitter know,Sounds like you spent alot of money for nothing.I would be looking for a new outfitter."
2052018,poultryman,2013-08-23 09:20:00,183,"DD73,Thats exactly what we were doing, though not at the guide's direction. The guide was throwing the lure that matched the hatch for the lake, a #7 copper bladed Buchertail in Goldie Locks color (red and gold sparkly tinfoil bucktail. I had my son throwing a topwater and my buddy throwing a different colored bucktail and I was throwing everything else in the aresenal. Jerkbaits, crankbaits, big double cowgirls. I was sticking to darker, natural colored baits (very clear water lake) and the only bait that moved fish was the red and copper buchertail until later in the day I threw on the cisco double 10 and had a pike hit it immediately (but that was the only fish that hit it).Once the light level changed and it became overcast, I had a strike on the black and black double 10.It might not have been so bad fishing from the back casting platform if I didnt have to trip over the dude's 4 extra rods.The biggest reason I hired the guide in the first place was to have someone else focus on boat control so I could fish with my son and my buddy."
2052082,downriverbob,2013-08-23 09:42:00,880,"The guide I learned to musky fish at LOTW was Robert Horley Sr. never fished while guiding my wife and I. I know that if he was in the boat guiding one person he would occasionally fish. Otherwise his attention was on putting you one fish. Robert passed away about 10 years ago, we now have his son Peter guiding us. He also does not cast for fish, occasionally he will drag a lure behind the boat if he is going to do shore lunch. I have a few times when I wanted to get a break had him fish and I would control the boat. BOB"
2052194,poultryman,2013-08-23 10:16:00,183,"Ive been musky fishing only for the last 4 years. This was my first year on my own. I lucked out and my wife let me sneak away for two whole weeks! I was happy to learn how to control the boat by myself and I landed my first 50 inch fish too. Of course, I wasnt prepared. I only had the walleye net with me as we were casting for small pike and bass. The brand new Frabill walleye conservation net bent in half under the weight of the pig. I was able to get her unhooked and released very quickly and she swam away strong, never leaving the water. I think Im still in shock. The musky was caught in Minnesota on the little Kitchi lake that empties into Cass Lake. I didnt even get a good photo! I have always been guided and Ive been used to either the guide not fishing or simply throwing a small mepps spinner from the back of the boat or alternatively jigging along as we would cast. I guess my lesson is to make sure we are clear as to what my expectations are before we leave the dock. I just want to double check with the good folks here as to what the expectations are for the Guide so Im in line with what to expect. I dont want to step on his or her toes. Getting off on the wrong foot can lead to a LONG day on the water..."
2052522,Larbo,2013-08-23 12:35:00,231,I don't think you over tipped the first guide. You felt he worked for it and earned it.4 people fishing for walleye in the same boat is fine as long as everybody is comfortable and catching fish. I believe in 2 casters in any musky boat. 3 will work if the boat is big enough and the caster's have experience throwing large baits. Nobody wants a bulldawg earring. I also agree with prior post's that the second guide trip experience could have been avoided with proper questions to guide or camp owner reguarding fishing expectations. It's a lesson learned the easy way and the hard way. Acknowledge it and plan the next trip. I bet 20 years from now you will still remember both trips. You will have many more good and great trips than bad guide trips because of this last one.LarboP.S. musky guides do not need to fish unless asked or it's a one on one situation.
2052594,Hawker,2013-08-23 13:27:00,3967,"As a ""guide"" myself, I will say that I do not fish ""period"", unless a client asks me to show them a technique etc. If in ""showing"" and I connect with a fish, the rod is passed to the client immediately. Of course, I primarily fish with live bait and seldom use artificial baits, but when the conditions do warrant the use of artificials, the only time I'd have a rod in my hand would be to show a cust/client how to work the bait only.From my perspective, you for sure over-tipped Guide-B, and had I been you, would likely not have tipped him at all. For sure in the future, talk with the guide beforehand long before you leave the dock, making sure he fully understands your expectations prior to leaving the dock. If you don't want him fishing, tell him/her straight up that YOU are the paying customer, he's the guide, not a 2nd, 3rd or 4th fisherman in the boat!! I only get to get up north and fish usually once a year, almost always the last week of May. From everything I've seen, heard and read, Muskie fishing is foremost a CPR fishery and I know for a fact you don't catch'em on every cast. IMHO, a guide (if he's gonna be fishing) should fish from the back of the boat and IF he hooks up on a Musky (or anything else be it large or small) should immediately be passing the rod to the client(s). After all, it's THEIR day, not his and he can go fishing on his off day(s)!! I actually had the beginnings of a day much like you described with Guide B except I ended that trip less than 2 hrs into the trip because he #1, insisted on fishing, #2, put himself on fish leaving my wife and I to fend for ourselves, #3, he was just not my cup-O-tea as a guide!"
2052602,MrSimon,2013-08-23 13:37:00,922,"There is no hard and fast rule on payment .... sounds like you put some thought into it and paid according to your experience. You did well. As a general rule, I prefer younger guides to older guides. Guys in their 20s who are already guides usually have lots of energy, are very polite and helpful, and want to impress their clients by putting them on fish. Older guides can sometimes be a bit lazy, cranky, and don't care if the clients have fun or not ... as long as they get paid. Obviously this is not a rule, but its what I've seen from my personal guide-hiring experiences."
2050162,Mr. Sauger,2013-08-22 15:37:00,285,"I have found there are no universal rules of how a guided trip should be run. Yes, some guides focus mostly on their fishing and think you should feel privileged just be in the boat with them.One guide blocked the depthfinder so you couldn't see the depth (so you can't learn their secret spot). When asked about the depth, he said it didn't matter, just keep you jig 4 feet down from the surface. (Kentucky Lake crappie  we still caught tons of slabs)A different guide also fished with us, but his primary focus remained on us catching fish. He asked if it was OK and we said yes, as it kept our confidence up when the bite slowed down. He was teaching as well as putting us on fish. (Kentucky Lake bass)Another guide did not fish, but spent all of his time tending to us and boat control. (Lake Erie wallies)Some provided the right equipment (gLoomis rods, lures for all  Green Bay smallmouth). I usually bring my own equipment. Many say don't bring your tackle and then are spotty with what is needed. Before I book a trip with a guide, I ask them to describe the day and chat a bit. It gives me a good idea of what his/her idea of a guided trip is. The chat also gives me a feel for their personality and their approach to treating a customer. I also ask about the boat to see if there will be enough room. Two guests and a guide casting crankbaits can get a little crowded in 18 footer if the guide is hogging the front casting deck. Jigging required less room. There are pros and shmoes."
2050186,LOW1,2013-08-22 15:43:00,2828,So you gave a 50% tip to the guide that was good but not great and a 30% tip to the guide that was only fair?I think both may have been high.25% for excellent service would be a good tip in my view.15% for fair service would also be generous in my view.I would be curious what a guide expects (if any) for his/her services in addition to the quoted fee.
2050514,DD73,2013-08-22 18:07:00,131,"This question comes up a lot on musky boards. I've been out with guides who fish from the front, and others who don't. I don't hire guides who fish from the bow any longer, but have zero problems with guides fishing behind me. Sounds to me like guide 2 gave you pretty bad service, I wouldn't have been happy with looking for walleyes when you'd asked to fish musky. As others have suggested, clarifying in advance with the guide what you expect (and listening to what they expect) is always a good idea."
2050650,NathanH,2013-08-22 18:50:00,697,"Musket guides should not fish unless invited in my opinion, same is true for other guides. But with Muskey your after so few fish why would a guide be fishing. They should run the boat get the camera ect"
2051330,poultryman,2013-08-23 05:49:00,183,"Yeah, I overtipped the first guy probably. But there were two adults and one kid in the boat. I basically overtipped because he was great dealing with my son and his reel issues. The reel issues were my fault for putting too much line on the reel the night before. So, I was happy to oblige and let him take care of things while I fished. It was worth it."
2051402,kzoofisher,2013-08-23 06:27:00,5144,"I've never understood the guide fishing on a lake. If he needs to run the trolling motor he should get a remote and do it from the middle of the boat, good place to keep an eye on the electronics, too. Never seen a coldwater guide fish unless he is demonstrating a technique. If I have no experience with the kind of fishing I've hired him for I expect him to help me out and maybe show me but that's it. I've known walleye guides to fish and keep what they catch until the boats limit is filled then call it a day. I always ask about that and won't hire a guy who does it. I suppose if you need fish for shore lunch and nobody can get a bite he might step up to fill the gap, but that's it. A bad guide can ruin a trip, with so many good ones out there it pays to shop around and isn't that hard to figure out with just a few questions. If you're at a lodge ask the other customers about their experiences and make sure the lodge knows what you expect. Being open about what you want can save everyone a headache."
