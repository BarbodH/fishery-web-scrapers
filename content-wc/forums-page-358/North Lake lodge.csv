2071986,bluefin85,2013-08-31 08:49:00,31,Has anyone fished Long Legged Lake in Ear Falls Ontario. Would like to hear how this lake and camp was. Sounds like the lake has just about every fish you want even trout. Thanks

2078105,Lucky shooting,2013-09-02 20:57:00,1,Fished about 4 times. Jerry and his staff do a great job of putting you on fish. Lots of great structure. Accommodations are decent. Usually averaged about 50 walleyes per day. Down side is the 47 miles on gravel to meeting location. Stork lake lodge is south of long legged and a bit shorter drive. Found the walleye fishing better there. The group I usually fish with went to stork in July and caught 2000 walleyes between eight guys in 3 days.
