Check your grocer, you can get Mrs. T's pierogies just about anywhere.Also boiled first then fried in butter and onion. They go well with a nice kielbasa."

2056074,Minnow Man,2013-08-25 09:04:00,85,Hello Larry M We stop in Dryden at the Patricia Inn and order our Perogery dinner. I order mine boiled first then pan fried. They are home made and the best in the north. We have also ordered them in Balmertown at the hotel and in Red Lake at the Lakeview. We always take a few dozen with us on our trip and add a few walleye with our dinner.
2058058,Mohleye,2013-08-26 07:52:00,368,Back to the pasties.......had them last week on the north shore.....very much like a pot pie....very good.
2062377,SVT1,2013-08-27 12:13:00,230,My Nana whom is Ukranian makes them and let me tell ya the frozen ones are gross.She even makes a taco filled one with crusty shell for dipping in salsa for all the football fans out there
2063137,adempsey,2013-08-27 16:01:00,963,I just tried some Lay's brand Perogy flavored potato chips. Not sure what to make of them.......https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.n...26679131_n.jpg
2063329,Nimstug,2013-08-27 17:08:00,2605,"I repectfully disagree, but I'm only speaking from personal experience. I'm 1/2 Polish, raised with Polish grandparents. Consumed more than my share of pierogis, keilbasa, kapusta, glomkie (sp?), kolaczki, kiska, and pazcki - mmm, paczki, and other foods using a very limited number of vowels in their spelling. Never got close to consuming czarnina and never will, thank you very much. California Daughter is coming to visit for my birthday in a couple of months for my birthday specifically to make me pierogis. 2200 miles! NimstugJak sie masz?"
2065178,jimirjr,2013-08-28 11:14:00,1149,"It was stricktly a 'tongue in cheek"" reference... ALTHOUGH, yes, I have eaten Czarnina many times when I was younger.. Also ate my share of pazcki, always fried in LARD by my Busia, filled with Apricot, Prune, Poppyseed, or Strawberry Jam. I still try to replicate My Busia's Pierogi's and Golmbki, I come close... But... it ain't the same."
2066874,bigwalleye1,2013-08-29 05:54:00,2632,If your Busia is the relative to you I think she is (Google was NOT my friend on that search) there is a reason you can't duplicate the recipe. There's a missing ingredient she had that only Grandmothers do. My Oma had it as well. Think about it and smile.

When buying them frozen in the grocery store I check to see where they are made. If there made in Manitoba or Alberta they are good, any where else and its a crap shoot."
2050202,GWC,2013-08-22 15:50:00,1021,"If you ever get to Allentown Pa try Stahley's. The perogies, steak sandwiches, steamed clams & of course the beer were all wonderful. We'll try them in Canada on our next trip."
2050466,Mark Komo,2013-08-22 17:40:00,867,"Well, first off. I would just like to say its Pierogies. Theres a huge festival in Whiting, IN. Its quite nice. We also have a SouthSide of Chicago Polish Festival. And yes, you guessed it, lots of Pierogies. Plenty of Pierogies in Meal-Wha-Kee, Chicago, Cleveland and Buffalo. Fantastic."
2050690,2746,2013-08-22 18:54:00,3206,"Actually Mark, if you do a search of the word, I think you'll find it spelled both ways. It's spelled Perogies on the Canadian menus I've seen. But,no matter how its spelled they taste phenomenal."

2053778,jimirjr,2013-08-24 07:00:00,1149,"My ""BUSIA"" made them filled with fried Saurkraut, potato and onion, dry sweetened cottage cheese, fresh plums, and sometimes.. potato, bacon and onion inside. They were then fried in butter or bacon fat or a combo of.... and sometimes smothered in fried onions.... She would serve the fruit filled ones with a dusting of sugar on top. She never served em with sour cream, however.... I picked up that bad habit later in life... lol! Making them was an ""all day"" affair as I remember..."
2054114,2746,2013-08-24 09:23:00,3206,"Man, that all sounds good! Don't know what or who ""BUSIA"" is but wish I had one that made Perogies. Also wish I lived in Littleton, Colo. pretty place and area. Try to make a trip to the Colorado mountains every year.....does something for my soul that's as good a Canada."

2054234,fishnutbob,2013-08-24 10:54:00,633,The best I bought was at the Ukrainian Church in North East Mpls. Every fri they would make them really good. Manitoba has a large Ukrainian population and they have the best going in Oct to fish and eat perogies. Yes

Husband and I split an order of 12 for lunch after reading your post earlier today. We had never eaten Perogies before. OH MY! I think we may be in trouble here.

2045001,Kansas Bound,2013-08-21 07:12:00,152,The first time I had them was in a camp pot luck on a Canada fishing trip. I think they are more of a polish dish but not for sure.

2045065,kzoofisher,2013-08-21 07:24:00,5144,"Perogies are Polish, get 'em just about anywhwere in Michigan. All are potato filled and some come with onion or cheese. My wife makes the Latvian style (piragi) which is breadier and is baked rather than boiled, filling is onion and bacon or ham. Pasties are Welsh. The miners used to take them for lunch since they are a meal all in one. Bread stuffed with meat and vegetables, especially rutabaga. Can be very good with gravy but the quality is highly variable. Extremely common in the Upper Peninsula."
2045129,2746,2013-08-21 07:34:00,3206,Nope! A few international food stores carry frozen ones but none I bought ever measured up to what I found in Canada restaurants.

2045329,kzoofisher,2013-08-21 08:15:00,5144,Frozen never compares to homemade and fresh. Look for the nearest Polish community and see if they have them at church events. If you can provide the fish* and they provide the perogies they would have a heck of a fundraiser. Fish fries during lent are always big money makers anyway. I wonder what they do in churches that frown on beer? No fear of that in a Polish parish!*assuming that's legal
