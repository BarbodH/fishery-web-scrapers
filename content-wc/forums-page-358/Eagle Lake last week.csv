I was tempted to spend a day walleye fishing, but just never could put the muskie rod down. Week started off tough with super hot weather and then post cold front in the middle of the week. Ended up getting the hooks into two fish and landing one which is my new personal best at 47 inches. If anyone else was on the east side at that time I'd be curious to hear how they did. I will say Bruce and Kim were fantastic hosts and my girlfriend and I had a great time. I loved being in the river too, and that's where I actually landed my muskie. The lodge was the nicest I've ever been to out of 5 other resorts, and that's not a knock against the others I've stayed at. If anyone is looking for that side of Eagle I would say check them out."
