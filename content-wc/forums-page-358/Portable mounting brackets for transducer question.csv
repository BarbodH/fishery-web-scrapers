2072986,halfmoon007,2013-08-31 20:18:00,121,hard to beat a piece of 1x4 pine with a c clamp. we all been using this method for years
2073145,alanexpup,2013-08-31 22:35:00,278,"HI. I had one of those hummingbird portables. I used a 4 inch c clamp welded to a 3/4 in pipe with a smaller pipe inside that i could slide up or down to get the transducer in the right depth. used it for years in canada. worked like a charm. i sold the whole setup, now i wished i kept it because we might be going back up. alan"
2073353,plumberjoe,2013-09-01 06:38:00,54,I pretty sure I read this on here but some guys take old tramsom mount trolling motors and strip them down to the mounting bracket and tube then mount there transducer to the bottom of the tube. Sounded like a good idea.
2073617,retire55,2013-09-01 08:28:00,1029,"I've used the standard boat bracket for a number of years and am more than satisfied (indeed, I have two of them). It easily fits into my boat bag and is one of the first things installed on the outfitters boat. Its easy to adjust to match transom heights. Best of all, it allows me to use my sonar (Lowrance HDS7) at WOT."
2066234,IA JOE,2013-08-28 18:22:00,35,Dad and I screwed the transducer to a 1X4 and clamped it to the camp boat with a big C-clamp. Works great.
2066354,joeflip,2013-08-28 19:44:00,75,"I just bought and put the mount together a few months ago.My recommendations. Stay away from the LRCD mount..much more complicated with directions provided and not suitable for all FF. As for directions, they are useless, I watched a video on You Tube of another guy with the mount and it helped much more than directions. I also added about 4 inches of stainless steel to the bracket. I used a 4 inch door hinge and the holes lined up perfect for a Hummingbird 587. If your familiar with the mount, the door hinge worked better than the metal piece that is provided to mount the transducer to.Joe"
2066410,BornToFish,2013-08-28 19:56:00,1224,"I purchased a Humminbird 700 series unit a few years ago and set it up as a portable unit that I take with me to NW Ontario for use on a lodge boat. I purchased the standard Portable Transducer Bracket from Cabela's on the recommendation of a good friend. It was a great investment. I adjusted it once several years ago and left it alone since then. I can remove the rather basic sonar unit that comes with the lodge boat and install my 'bird unit in about three minutes. I affixed my transducer to the bracket with some stainless steel screws and nuts. This took a little bit of finnagling, but was fairly straight forward. The bracket that I purchased does not have the extra arm that is shown in the link in the first post on this thread. As some one pointed out, it wouldn't help when attached to the transom as the unit would be behind me. I mount the monitor to a RAM unit, which is attached to a piece of marine plywood. I simply attach the plywood to the boat with two screws.All in all, I'm glad that I have the aluminum bracket."
2066738,forgop,2013-08-29 03:25:00,880,"Thanks for the feedback on the suction cups. I searched older threads and saw the recommendations to use steel wool/sandpaper to clean the site, but one other thing mentioned was to use some vaseline in the cup. Has anyone else tried this?"
2066818,jimirjr,2013-08-29 05:39:00,1149,"I always made sure the ""mounting surface had no algae aor scum on it and ""stuck"" the suction cup on the transom and left it all week... NEVER had a problem at all... Of course, most rental boats won't go over 20 mph, so speed wasn't a problem...Be careful if You pull into shore, though.... if parked at a dock, no problem!"
2068218,phishfearme,2013-08-29 13:08:00,1242,i would think that the Vaseline could help - probably by keeping the suction cup nice and pliable as well as improving the seal itself - i'm gonna give it a try - like putting on the Vaseline right now to keep the cup pliable all year rather than letting it possibly get dry rotted over the winter. phish
2069793,SinOrSwim,2013-08-30 07:42:00,1528,"Sometimes it's about insurance. It may or may not work better but at the same time bolting and clamping on are more secure and if a replacement transducer is upwards of $150.00, then it can be worth the peace of mind. To each their own. Some people can fish out of a 14 foot john boat and some people have 20+ feet Pro V's. Both get the job done."
2070129,pikeman14,2013-08-30 09:05:00,144,"After reading many posts about how well the suction cup worked, I scrapped the mount idea thinking I would save on weight. Second day on the trip, the suction cup came off and tore the wires. Pricey mistake."
2070193,SinOrSwim,2013-08-30 09:27:00,1528,"Man, that stinks! One of the first years I flew in I decided I wanted to be proactive and keep cords out of the way etc. So, I ran the wires to the transducer down and around me so they were tucked away. Problem!!!!! They slowly worked their way up and without me knowing, the cable was in the metal portion of the swivel seat. Cut that **** thing in half. I was able to piece it back together to show depth but it wouldn't show anything else."
2070577,tuiflies,2013-08-30 12:46:00,158,Do either of the mounts from cabela's allow you to put the transducer on such that it will be pointing forward when mounted on the side of a canoe?
2064226,forgop,2013-08-28 05:36:00,880,I just purchased 2 Humminbird 571 DI PT fishfinders and those come with the suction cup brackets. I'm looking for something a little more secure and read good things about the Cabela's portable bracket. I'm unsure whether to get the standard bracket or the one with the LCR mount. Could anyone please give me a quick explanation of what difference there would be between the two? Thanks!http://www.cabelas.com/product/Porta...h-All+Products
2064330,MorganMan,2013-08-28 06:19:00,341,"I have one of those portable transducer brackets. I first used it last year and it was a great buy for me as I have lost a transducer on a fly in due to being only held by a suction cup and a small rope to secure it to the boat. Especially with the price of replacement transducers these days. The bracket you showed looks a bit different from mine but that may be the newer/improved product? LOL.....I will tell you the little piece of paper (instructions) that thing comes with is of little help when it comes to putting the thing together!!!!! They really should just sell it assembled, wouldn't take that much bigger of a box."
2064378,SinOrSwim,2013-08-28 06:34:00,1528,"If you are mounting to the transom of a boat that is straight up and down, you want the standard mount. It is picture number 2 on your link. THe one shown is the LCR mount. Don't know what that is used for?I just bought one the other day. I got mine from Bass Pro but it's the same thing.Oh, and good luck putting that F#%@&$ # thing together. LOLOLOLOLOL MorganMan helped me when I was doing mine last week. He went through the same thing last year. I have been using the suction cup mount for all these years and then saw how easy his was to use and how sturdy it was compared to the suction cup last year on our trip.If you read the reviews, people love the unit but the instructions are horrible. Now, that I see your link, use the pictures in your link to help you. WAAYYY better than anything they provide."
2065186,jimirjr,2013-08-28 11:17:00,1149,"I've used the SUCTION CUP transducer mounts MANY times in Canada and have never had a problem... Just tie off the ""safety cord"" to the transom somewhwere and You can't screw it up..."
2065266,polaris-pete,2013-08-28 11:43:00,343,"I have been fishing Canada since 1966 and still use the suction cup transducer mount.Very rearly does it come off and as mentioned, if you tie the cord alittle short, the transducer can't goe anywheres if it does loosen up. The brackets are nice but in my Years, not needed, just another thing to cart along."
2065594,SinOrSwim,2013-08-28 13:52:00,1528,"I've never had trouble with the suction cup coming off but it also doesn't sit as far down in the water. So, I don't get readings when I have the boat at any decent speed. I have a humminbird 595C with GPS. If i'm over about 5mph, it doesn't sit in the water far enough to get a depth. I'm hoping I can put it further into the water to look for structure at a little higher speeds."
2065706,Phil T,2013-08-28 14:50:00,4820,"Long, long ago, when I was fishing from resort rental boats, I made a transducer mount that clamped to the boat's transom. The transom clamp was a stamped steel C-clamp that would open over 2"". I drilled a hole in the C-clamp at its corner. I used, I think, a piece of closet rod for the vertical leg of the mount. A simple drilled hole in the wooden rod and a bolt attached the wooden leg to the C-clamp, and I could swivel the thing up out of the way when beaching the boat because I thought ahead and left some of the closet rod sticking up above the C-clamp where I could grab it. The standard transducer boat mount was bolted to the bottom of the closet rod. I did end up drilling two holes in the closet rod, one for 16"" and a higher one for 20"" transoms. It cost a lot less than an aluminum manufactured one."
2065746,phishfearme,2013-08-28 15:07:00,1242,I fall in with the crowd who simply use the suction cup without any elaborate bracket - BUT we always bring along sandpaper and steel wool to smoothen and clean the area where the suction cup attaches. tie it off to the boat and that's all you need. phish
2065802,new hips,2013-08-28 15:39:00,498,"Wait for your next birthday present from your kids.......and buy the bracket, it works great, adjusts to proper depth as all transoms are not created equal. Have had mine for the last 5 trips and never looked back, very light weight and I usually stuff it in my rain suit bag (for transport) as I usually do fly in trips. I figure all the money I spend on fishing STUFF another $45 won't break the bank."
2066154,JOE WALLEYE,2013-08-28 17:57:00,753,"to answer your question on the difference between the two mounts. The LCR mount has a horizontal bar on it that you can mount your graph to. It would not work well on the back of a boat because the display would be behind you, but it works well on the side of canoe."
