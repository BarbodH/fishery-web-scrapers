2076697,dosxx,2013-09-02 13:05:00,60,"I have fished Wanzatika twice with a group of 4 and we really got the numbers there. Nothing really of size, but lots and lots of walleyes, all day long. It was a lot of fun! The last time we fished it, though, was about 5 years ago, so I am not sure if it has changed. The lake is not huge so it is easy to learn."
2076745,theamateurangler,2013-09-02 13:21:00,5,"Thanks Dosxx. When we fished Hilmer, we had most of our success for walleye jigging a rocky area, a flat, and an area where the wind was blowing the back half of an island. When we went to McLeister, it was pretty much weed walleye all the way. From what you remember, what are the primary methods you used for Walleye?"
2077057,RickOnt,2013-09-02 15:14:00,217,Not meaning to highjack your thread but I am also interested Hearst Air and Wanzatika and Mcleister.You said Mcliester is weed Walleye not sure what you mean
2077105,theamateurangler,2013-09-02 16:00:00,5,"Hi RickOnt, We were at McLeister a few weeks ago. I have a full report here:http://scottmillsfishing.wordpress.c...cleister-lake/ What we found is that on McLeister, the Walleye related most to the weeds. We had most of our success in the river. On the main lake we had success for the eyes on worm harnesses, and pulling cranks along weed edges or just over the tops of the weeds. Other anglers who have gone to McLeister indicate that if you want to jig through the weeds you can have a lot of success as well, but that' not my preferred way of fishing, so we didn't. Happy to answer questions on Hilmer or McLeister!"
2077225,dosxx,2013-09-02 16:46:00,60,"We fished both times in July and two of us focused on weedy spots and shorelines, and my buddy and I focused on bottom structure. There was a long narrow hump (seems it was to the right of the cabin as you face the water) kind of out in the middle, we would try to stay on that vertical jigging. When the wind was a certain way, we could only stay on it for just a few minutes at a time, drift over it, and then motor back to the other side. Both of our groups caught fish, so the truth is, it did not seem to matter that much how we fished."
