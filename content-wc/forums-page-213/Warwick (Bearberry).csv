We got full week in but were scheduled for four more days. Disappointing, but we did what was right. The fishing was a little rough. Lot of deep water and fish were deep. I caught one eye off bottom at 52'. We figured them out but took a bit. Caught nice 36"" pike, my personal best, and lost another heavy one. Did not target pike at all. Were caught jigging for eyes. Caught a 24"" and26"" eye as well. I have no doubt there are nice fish in there. Rain every day, or night, temps decent, bugs not bad. Camp, boats good. All in all great time. Now the countdown for17!"
