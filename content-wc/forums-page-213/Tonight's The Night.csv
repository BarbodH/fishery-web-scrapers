Pulling out tonight with Doc for an overnight drive along the north shore of Superior to Armstrong, ON. We will spend the night at a Mattice cabin and then fly out Sat. morning for Luella Lake. Expect a report upon our return. A special shout out to Russell (ref. by Mike Borger) who hooked me up with a detailed map of the lake and one man's take on how to fish it. Also a shout out to Jason (jsmyers on WC) for the advice on how to fish in the fall. We'll let you know how that works out. To say I am a little geeked up about this trip would be an understatement. After Doc's heart attack on the way home from Wine Lake in the spring, we realize that this could be our last shot at doing a fly in. While we are gone we expect all of our WC friends to hold the world together! Fish on! Hooks"

A short time before Don & Annette purchased the cabin some gal hauled in a 45lb. Laker....used to be two tourney anglers that showed up every year for a week and they caught and released several hundred Walleye per day, granted they fished hard early am to late pm every day. Have a safe trip and enjoy."
