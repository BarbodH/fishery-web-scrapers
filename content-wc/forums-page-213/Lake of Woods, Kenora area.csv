5108009,BRP,2016-09-12 11:48:00,77,"We've had lots of success on the last 3 weekends in 15 to 25 feet with jigs and minnows (real and fake, doesn't seem to matter). Color doesn't seem to matter either. Lots of perch and smallmouth mixed in, plus the odd pike. I'm far from expert and slowly learning the lake (at least my little section of it near the Keewatin channel). Flat areas in back bays have worked, so have drop offs around mid lake humps. Areas of current have produced the biggest fish. Good luck."
5108609,Low4fish,2016-09-12 17:54:00,37,"I have noticed it was tougher this August. I wrote it off to unstable weather. However the last two weekends have been some great fishing. Saturday past was a banner day we were culling by 900 am, and fish were biting on most everything. Sent from my SM-T800 using Tapatalk"
5108849,martinbns,2016-09-12 19:38:00,1520,"We found the same thing the latter half of August, but were out this weekend and much better. We were drifting with minnows and leeches with mixed success, when we switched to worms we caught lots of fish, probably 30 total between my wife and I. Probably a dozen of them would have been good eater size."
5116729,Flip Silverlake,2016-09-18 14:05:00,645,My wife and I have the pleasure of fishing Lake of The Woods from June 3rd until the 27th of August and have done this for a number of years. Just to give you an idea the first time I fished LOW was in 1962 so I have some idea what that lake has to offer. What has been happening over the last few years is the local Aboriginals have been netting the north east part of this lake very heavily. The netting has gotten to the point that they have been running south through Eagles Pass to get their fish. This is completely unregulated. Fishing has now gotten to the point where all you can catch are 12 to 13 inch fish. You can fill a boat of with these but that's all that's left out there. We have had to run 25 to 20 miles down the lake to get into quality fish. I have pictures of a 1000 foot net being set between Heaps Point and Maize's Island (not sure on that spelling). For those of you that are going to say I don't know what I'm doing or try a different technique remember I've been doing this since 1962. The new nick name for that north east portion is now the Dead Sea. This all started when the fish processing plant was reopened in Kenora. I've talked to guys that have been fishing there for a long time and are now talking about fishing Lake Erie. If anyone has a goofy idea that the decrease in population of Walleye is being cause by hook and line fishing is been getting to much of the sun. This has to stop and it has to stop very soon.
5116961,martinbns,2016-09-18 18:01:00,1520,Reality is the aboriginals have that right under Treaty. Everywhere I have lived and hunted we sportsman have blamed Natives for what we perceive to be a diminishing resource.
5117049,Flip Silverlake,2016-09-18 19:35:00,645,"You are absolutely right, they can fish and hunt to provide food for their family. I do not believe the intent of the treaties was to provide an unregulated commercial fishing operation. That's exactly what's going on. At the time when the treaty was signed there weren't 20 foot open boats with 50 horsepower motors on them. They didn't have 1000 foot nets that have the ability to pick only a special sized fish. It's not hard to find when the nets are being pulled because the sky is full of Gulls and Pelicans. Back in the 80""s the MNR bought the licenses from the commercial fisherman because the same exact thing was happening then. I have no problem with anyone keeping his family fed but I do have a problem when the intent of the treaty is being violated to fill someone's pockets. They are starting to net further down the lake. It's going to be interesting when the same conditions start to manifest themselves down there. If the aboriginals are commercially fishing they need to come under the same rules and regulations that the other guys were. Don't even think about blaming the hook and line fisherman there aren't enough of us out there to fish out that lake."
5117249,martinbns,2016-09-19 05:07:00,1520,"You aren't wrong, I am just saying there are no governments in Canada that will act on the concern you bring up."
5117273,deadhead1,2016-09-19 05:39:00,193,I live in Bgstone Bay area and have done for last five years. I know exactly what you mean by nets being out. The net I see regularly is the one just east of entrance to eagles pass. There are often nets further southwest on the north side of Hay Island. I don't blame the entire slow bite this summer on the nets as it seemed to be happening on all areas of the lake but I do see lower fish populations in the area I fish the most which is Bigstone and Storm Bay.
