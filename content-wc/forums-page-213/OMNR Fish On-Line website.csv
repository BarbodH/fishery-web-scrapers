I zoomed in on some spots where I know there are humps and reefs that come within 10' of the surface and could see them. Also scouted bays that are miles from where I usually fish and spotted more structure which I was able to roll the cursor over and get GPS coordinates for. Going to be a fun tool to browse through this winter.http://www.web2.mnr.gov.on.ca/fish_o...plorer_en.html"

5112009,Lake Of The Woods,2016-09-14 20:18:00,124,I worked for the OMNR in the Kenora and lived in the Lake of the Woods area for many years.I checked out the site and the many lakes in that area that I had and still do fish.I found some of the fish species information not to be accurate for several lakes.I would calculate the accuracy to be in the 85% range.Aside from that the site gives decent information on what one could expect when arriving at a body of water for the first time.
5112217,kzoofisher,2016-09-15 02:31:00,5144,"The contour maps are in the menu on the left, just click the icon to activate them. The fish species is interesting but only lists game fish and as noted not 100% accurate. I was hoping to find out what the principle prey species were so that I could focus on their late summer locations. The dominant forage that I have found in Lake Windermere are whitefish which stay below the thermocline. There must be something above the thermocline and I'm not looking in the right places for it."
