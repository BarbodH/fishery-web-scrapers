5098497,elkman99,2016-09-05 13:41:00,180,"So I made my reservations to Eagle Lake Sportsmen's Lodge for these dates next year. Taking the wife and 2 girls (8 and 14) on their inaugural trip to Canada. Can't wait! I figure we have Kenora, Dryden, sheep farm, all within an hour so the girls can shop on those less than desirable weather days. Hoping for 70 and sunny of course . I have fished area lakes during this timeframe, and usually it depends on the spring, but are there any tendencies on Eagle during this timeframe for walleye, musky, and pike? I know the west arm is trout water, which I like, even though it can be tough. any thoughts on tactics for walleyes or any other species would be great! thanks"

Its about the prettiest beach you're going to find, my kids really enjoyed it. Not far from where you're staying."
5098633,prov1800,2016-09-05 16:00:00,5010,Farmnfish is totalky right about blue lake provincial park.it is awesome.water can be a lityle cooler but refreshing.also has the hiking trails.as far as fishing thexwest arm is not just for lake trout.some of the best walleye/muskie is definatly available there.i have some freinds that stay at sportsmans. You will enjoy it there. Couple of nice beaches not far from camp to stop at also.
5098769,elkman99,2016-09-05 18:20:00,180,"I'm just hoping he muskies are not in a post spawn mode in the west arm when we get there. That will keep me from having to boat to the more stained parts of the lake. though, most of my fishing will be with the girls for pike/walleye, so as long as they have their rods bent, they will be happy. I'm excited to show them the beauty of Canada. I figured the West Arm would be a good place for that, plus the option of portage lakes which I think they would love."
5098817,prov1800,2016-09-05 18:46:00,5010,Muskies normally will be sppawned out well before that.sportsmans bay has a good muskie population in it as well as railroad bay for a ton of pike.
5098865,elkman99,2016-09-05 19:21:00,180,thanks prov! Is it a pretty neat portage into violet and crabclaw lakes? Is it good fishing in there?
5100210,prov1800,2016-09-06 16:03:00,5010,I dont do the portage lakes.only one i have done is into buzzard lake.not sure if jim has boats in those lakes.
5100466,jkretch,2016-09-06 19:20:00,80,"I fished Crabclaw one day out of Sportsmans with my two sons. we caught qaulity walleye, smb and pike. Park boat in Crabclaw creek and easy, short portage to small baot (4 will be crowded). We had to carry 8 hp motor in and out. Not an issue for me as my 6' 6"" 225 # son treated it like a small carry on bag....but may be different for you. We didn't catch a ton, but quite a few and good sized. Clearwater is another fun option if the creek has enough water. Trout, whitefish and pike. Nice camp and well kept. Muskies are rafely easy in that lake but a chance for a giant. Walleyes abundant. Lindy rigs best for us....make sure you have flouro line or leaders. Clear water."
