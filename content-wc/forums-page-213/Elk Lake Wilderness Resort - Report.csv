He only fished for 21/2 days, but packed in a surprising amount of fishing and exploring in a very short period of time!This is a drive-to resort and does NOT have the type of incredible off the hook angling that many venues in northwestern Ontario have, but based on Scott's story I believe it will be an attractive option for some, especially those with families who are on a budget!Most interesting to me was how the resort handled meals - they were delivered directly to the cabin piping hot at whatever time Scott wished. Pretty cool set up that I've never heard of before.If you're at all interested you can see the full story here:http://www.canadafishingguide.net/el...north-getaway/Cheers, Mike"

5101705,BrianE,2016-09-07 17:38:00,98,Thanks again for sharing Mike. That's one of the joys about Canada. There is always a lodge for someone someplace somewhere in what i call God's country! Funny thing is near my parents cabin in Northern Michigan there is a small river that flows into Lake Superior and it is called the Montreal river. Brings back alot of memories when you mentioned that name as my Dad took me camping there one night when i was very young.
