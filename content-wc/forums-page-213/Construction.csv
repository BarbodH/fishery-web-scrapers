5101553,Hawkfan,2016-09-07 15:06:00,237,"Any update on road construction between I-Falls and VBAY? I saw in thread that 105 has some north, but wondered what other roads might look like. Wondering if we want to go toward Dryden or Nestor Falls after we cross. Thanks for any info."
5101817,Stringbean,2016-09-07 18:48:00,279,"We used Hwy 502 in early July. From the east side of the Noden causeway there are multiple places where culverts are being replaced. Each culvert dig had multiple pot holes to dodge. Before you turn the corner onto 502 and you look straight ahead, you can see where the construction goes as far as you can see. Hwy 502 is in very good shape. The construction area on Hwy 105 south of Ear Falls is about 10 miles long."
5101889,Pooch,2016-09-07 19:35:00,4619,"Couple weeks ago there was road rebuilding on the Dryden end of 502. Made a mess out of travelers vehicles following the water truck. As fast as the Canadians rebuild roads, it could be done by now.""Skywagon"" might know.Pooch"
5101897,Jesse-WI,2016-09-07 19:41:00,534,we came back Saturday and construction was not yet completed. It existed between Dryden and Fort Frances and Vermilion Bay and Ear Falls. Cost us an hour going up the prior Saturday. The were not working on the way home but roads were not yet done.
5102105,Hawkfan,2016-09-07 21:19:00,237,Thanks guys! Anyone been up 71 instead?
5102433,Lmbkiller,2016-09-08 06:42:00,639,Back in July there was more construction up 71 than there was 502. Check Ontario road conditions on the net
5102537,LOW1,2016-09-08 08:02:00,2828,"In mid August there was minor construction on 71 on shoulders and culverts between ""The Junction"" where 71 turns north and Kenora. Two or three short stretches of single lane with flaggers. Added about 10 minutes to the trip - no big deal."
5103113,tjandy,2016-09-08 14:57:00,107,We left Red Lake at 9:30 am on the August 19th and crossed the border at 4:30 pm ugh
5107225,pattmit,2016-09-11 19:38:00,36,Any update on construction on 105? Headed up towards RedLake on Saturday. Staying in Vermillion Bay Friday night. Thanks for any updates
5107506,port1042,2016-09-12 06:28:00,509,There are a couple of culverts being replaced on 105 between Vermillion Bay and Perrault Falls. One had a flagman and one is set up with stop lights. Came through on Saturday 9-10. We only went as far as Perrault Falls so I can't comment on anything north of that. There is also some resurfacing going on between Kenora and Nestor Falls on 71. No serious delays but a couple of spots with flagmen. Crews are working on Saturday. Hwy. 71 with construction is still better than driving 502!
