They are tough, bounce off rocks, troll well, can cast a mile, catch everything in the lake. All sizes worked well, I never really was concerned about close depth control, let them out closer or further depending on depth. I fished jigs and bouncers more than cranks, but used them in a lot of conditions, checking out a new spot, or especially, anchoring on top of a reef on a windy day and fan casting around the boat. Probably a lot of cranks would work good, but if I had one choice only it would be a large H n T in the gold/pink color."

5096922,retire55,2016-09-04 07:11:00,1029,"In late Aug and all through Sep, I'll sometimes troll Hot 'n Tots for walleye as deep as 28 feet on 10/4 Fireline."
5099186,Crackback,2016-09-06 04:29:00,257,"So how do you fish for walleyes now if you don't troll? Are you one of those guys that is still pitching Erie Dearies with a wad of night crawlers using the countdown method? that ended 20 years ago too! .......I think A 1/4 oz tot will run 16 feet with 10# XT mono, but I will have to check out the dive curve as you should too!"
5099474,The tank,2016-09-06 09:34:00,340,When you ask how deep they run there's factors you need to consider. I have a certain speed I run (everyone has there own speed that works) how much line you want out. The more line out the deeper it will run. Faster you troll the deeper it will dive.
5092569,mroyle,2016-08-31 11:22:00,74,Anybody troll with hot 'n tots for walleye? How deep will they go with 10# fireline?
5092577,The tank,2016-08-31 11:34:00,340,Give or take a little we use the smaller ones to 10' and the larger ones to 13'
5092585,jfaisten,2016-08-31 11:45:00,1060,10 to 15 years ago hot n tots is all we trolled with in Lake Erie. That's changed but I'm sure they still work well. We used the smaller ones -- 10' is about right. I don't troll for walleye anymore. I've got about 20 or 30 I'll sell ya! Good luck
5092745,The tank,2016-08-31 13:31:00,340,I sent you a pm not sure if it sent?
5092953,fsz,2016-08-31 16:22:00,144,"My experience is a little deeper than the other posters. More like 12'-14', (2-4 ft deeper for the big ones) with 8lb xl triline. They still work in erie on certain applications. A great lure to ""find"" fish with due to the amount of side to side movement it covers a lot of water."
5093129,TIGHTLINER,2016-08-31 17:49:00,223,I troll the smaller hot n tot in the chrome/black and gold/black would not head to Canada without 4 of each color. Been using them for years have never failed me yet. I really think it is more of the action of them than the color. I have several that 95% of the coloring is gone they still hit them.
5093642,jfaisten,2016-09-01 05:14:00,1060,"Just went thru my ""collection"" of hot n tots. Absolute mess. Been in the basement for 10 plus years. Hooks rusted and bent, even rusted together. Sorry, into the trash bin."
5093746,Bill Krejca,2016-09-01 07:07:00,6107,"I just hate to throw away old tackle. If any of it is salvageable, I'd take it off your hands. If interested, send me a PM. Thanks, Bill"
5093834,spurs101,2016-09-01 08:13:00,635,"Chrome/black has been hot all year for me. It's the erratic action I think what triggers. I use the smaller (3/16 oz) for the most part. It will get to 10-12 ft with 12lb mone. I'll let 50 to 100 ft. out depending on the depth of the contour I'm working. Flat out...they work. I use them for finding fish.....seems like anything will hit them...crappie, rock bass big gills, northern, lmb and smb and yes walleye. I use them on Lake Michigan also."
5093850,Bowtech84,2016-09-01 08:38:00,572,I've tried them in the Midwest and have never caught a walleye. Not in my top 5 favorite walleye lures so I may just not give them enough of a chance but I have tried them.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
