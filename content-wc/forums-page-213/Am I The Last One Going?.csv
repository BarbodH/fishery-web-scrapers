Late August to mid-September are more typical, but that's how it works out this time around.I have heard / read that 55 degrees f is the magic autumn water temp when the fish turn on. Any truth to that? Water temp is in the 59 to 62 when I've been there Targets are Pike, walleye, smallmouth and big crappie. I've got my techniques outlined but I would enjoy reading what works for you. Also, do I need to turn off the lights and lock up? Nimstug...hey! How 'bout those Cubs!"

Will likely be a typical late summer pattern.I'll be exactly 640 kilometers north of Rainy September 18-25, I'm a little worried about the weather myself."
5104977,bigstorm2,2016-09-09 16:56:00,33,"I head up to Rainy Lake 3 weeks from today, fishing 10/1 thru 10/5 (staying on the MN side though). In my opinion, the cooler that water temp the better, the fish seem to get more aggressive in the fall. Our main targets are walleyes but we will spend some time chasing crappies too"
5105049,quickster2,2016-09-09 17:42:00,41,My experience in the fall is the fish are not scattered and if you mark them you can catch them. Rainy calmer days during this period are awesome!
5105353,Baseline,2016-09-09 20:42:00,3207,"In late September and early October I usually fish the Redgut side of Rainy. I always find most the walleyes on summer structure hanging on the reefs and fish them with jigs and minnows. I usually can find a few walleyes along weed beds adjacent to deep drop offs and troll crankbaits next to the weeds. Crappies are usually located off the deeper sides of reefs and off deep shoreline drop-offs in 30 to 35 FOW. I just returned today from the English River north of Kenora. The water temp was still at 69-70f. Water temps can drop fast, but it goes without saying that it depends on the weather and how cool the nights get."
