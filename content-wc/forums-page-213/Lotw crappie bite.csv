5110841,1700SS,2016-09-14 06:50:00,104,I would be interested also. How bout Thompson creek?
5110849,Obabikon,2016-09-14 06:55:00,2370,"Its been pretty slow going so far. I think the weather has been too warm (until yesterday anyways) for them to move out deep. Local people that know where the sunken trees are have been catching tons of them. If they're on the trees still, I would say at least a week until they're in full force out in the elbow."
5110857,Obabikon,2016-09-14 06:56:00,2370,As far as bottle bay (south east of Thompson Creek)... I've been boats there. I stopped yesterday for 20 minutes and caught one little walleye. Not much going on there either.
