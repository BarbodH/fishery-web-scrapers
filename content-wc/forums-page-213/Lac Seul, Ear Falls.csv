Walleye fishing was very good, but I do think numbers were a little higher this year and size was a little smaller. We caught more smallmouth and northern pike this year than ever, and we never target either. My boat fished about 40% trolling and 60% jigging this year and both ways produced fish for us on different days. Jig color never seems to matter for my boat and depth was 7-30 feet while jigging. Minnows or 1/2 crawlers worked equally well on the jigs. Crankbaits usually work best on Lac Seul for me if they are bright colored, and depth for trolling was 6-18 feet. Several of the walleyes had 4-5"" very shiny, slender minnows in their mouth or belly. Don't know if they are smelt or a shiner species. Our fishing spots are usually wind driven, but we did manage to catch fish in a couple not so windy areas for a change. Stayed at Gawley's Little Beaver Lodge about 7 miles south of Ear Falls. Great place to stay, sheltered harbor, free ice/docking/electric on dock, great fish cleaning house, and nice cabins. We did get to see northern lights several days very vividly. Saw a bear on 105 on the way up and a couple otters on Lac Seul, as well as a very healthy number of eagles. Plenty of road construction on 105 with multiple sections of road torn up. This did cause a delay, and a very dirty truck and boat, but having driven from International Falls to Ear Falls for many years I think the road is tremendously improved over what it was back then and look forward to this section being better also. All in all a great trip, already looking forward to next year."

5109017,MikeinMN,2016-09-13 01:41:00,190,"One year there I foul hooked a shiny slender minnow on a crankbait. It seemed to be some type of shiner and looked similar to the emerald shiners I've seen on LOTW. The minnows this year were all a little too decomposed for me to be 100% sure, but they did look like smelt I've caught on the Great Lakes but maybe with slightly smaller mouths. We also found a small 5-6"" eelpout (burbot) in one of the pike we cleaned."
5109217,Lmbkiller,2016-09-13 06:36:00,639,"Many emeralds in lac seul also. Have seen large lawyers out of there also. Since they are most active in winter, and relatively few people ice fish there, I would guess the population is fishable, sauger as well"
5109833,MikeinMN,2016-09-13 11:59:00,190,"We have caught a few sauger there. Have caught a few lake perch as well, and we caught one lonely rock bass several years ago. Never caught a musky on the NW end, but I'm sure one wanders down that way occasionally. I've also heard there is a very small population of lake trout, but never actually heard of someone catching one."
