Decided to try the Angle. I realize there probably aren't any suprises up there, and we will find fish at all the usual places, just wondering how it's been."
5116337,Bob/MN,2016-09-18 08:25:00,178,I was up in the angle two weeks ago and fished Bishops bay and Big narrows. Most of our fish came from 24 to 28 FOW. We had our best luck pulling spinners with crawlers at 0.7 to 1 mph.

Didn't seem to matter where as we fished from east along McPherson island one day, and north for two days. We didn't have to go as far as Bishop Bay. Our best luck was in the 13-18 ft range. Water temp is 64 degrees Fishing was fantastic with lots of 16-21 inch Walleyes being caught."
