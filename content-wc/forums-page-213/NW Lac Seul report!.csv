Thursday We fished down in Mckenzie 1 day and caught fish from 6 to 18' fow lot of nice fish biggest being 25.5"" probably a dozen in the slot. clicker said 50 in my boat on the day lots of fun. Friday the wind switched to the South so we stuck to steamboat bay and caught lots of 15 - 16"" eyes on a few different windblown spots. 22 - 24 fow Saturday found a great spot on the calm side of the lake where the fish were stacked in 30' all different sizes of fish up to 25"" with a couple 35"" northerns to boot. Sunday rain was coming in so Doug Gawley suggested we keep close to camp as the weather was coming in. So we tried a spot we hadn't fished in years and did very well in 22' to 24' fow with biggest being 26.25"" we got a few hours in before the lightning chased us off the lake. Northern lights were booming at night as a bonus was a great trip!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Most walleye were caught in 25 to 30 fow trolling with a minnow, spinner and bottom bouncer. Several 35 to 37 northern caught on Red Eye wiggler spoons. Biggest surprise was catching several nice walleye with blue and white jigs, normally use chartreuse. Worst thing of the trip that happen, which happened (last year also) is the road construction. They grind up both sides of asphalt on hwy 105, then water it down to compact it. While doing this they have you drive on it after it has been watered. It is the worst mess I have ever tried to remove from truck, trailer and boat. With a new truck this year it really p****d me off and the fact that it has happened two years in a row. Just seems as if there is no consideration for people and their vehicles. Possibly grind up one half at a time so there is hard surface for traffic. Last year a motorcyclist was behind us and I really felt sorry for him. They should be giving everyone vouchers for vehicle cleaning. Overall, good fishing, good food, good people, good lodging, safe trip and bad road construction practices."
