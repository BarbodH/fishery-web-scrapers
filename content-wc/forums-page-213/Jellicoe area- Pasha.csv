Heading to Pasha in a few weeks planing to fish Onaman and some of the other back lakes (ex,Northwind). Never been to this area. Only targeting walleye. I'm assuming the old stand by hair jigs as well as jigs with twister tails with worm, leech, minnow produce in this area. Thinking white, yellow, pink, green in 1/4 to 5/16. We usually drift jigs as opposed to anchor in our normal journeys, assuming this works in this area? Will Hot-n-tots and weighted #11 rapalas work to find fish to set up drifts? Any thoughts on what works best in this area bait and tackle wise is appreciated. Also not sure if area lakes will be turned-over (sept 15). Curious on good depths this time of year. Anyone with insight on these lakes feel free to PM if you prefer. Thanks"

Last year though (my first fall trip) crawler harnesses seemed to work much better than jigs. Started with jigs because we use them so much in the spring, but had a hard time selling them to the fish.We're up there 9/11-9/18, maybe we'll see you on the water! Big pond though, and like I said, I don't know it armt all.- Steve"

I have trolled with crankbaits to find fish, but its certainly not necessary unless you enjoy that style of fishing. For me, fishing in this area is pretty simple. 99% of the time I'm using jig/minnow and will drift around points and weedlines. Fishing Onaman Lake is an amazing experience...you'll love it. It's been a few years since I've fished around Pasha Lake in the fall, but the last time I found fish at all depth ranges and they were hungry."

5101633,Brightsgrover,2016-09-07 16:26:00,2,"We visit this area every year, caught many walleye 1 month ago on Oxaline, Frank, Partridge, Wildgoose and Parks. Onaman & Northwind are okay (busy), we have found most of the good fishing is below (south) Highway 11 around Parks & Postagoni. Jiggin leeches 5 to 10 FOW."
5101809,eyemike,2016-09-07 18:44:00,233,"I haven't fished the area in a few years. I spent many years fishing the surrounding lakes and hands down my lures of choice are 1/8th to 1/4 oz. RoadRunner jig in various colors, white,yellow, blue. Tip with a local Dace no rubber tail, just the RR and minnow. Killer on all of the lakes in the area. #7 Shad Rap in perch color and bottom bounce with spinner and minnow. I doubt Onaman is busy that time of year and there is a lot of water and a lot of fish!"
