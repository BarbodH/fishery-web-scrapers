As for the advice, your comment may be true because I've never asked for fishing advice at either place. Not that I don't need advice, but we had been fishing the area out of Hidden Island for several years prior to getting into the RV's so we already knew the area. TGG"
535536,2746,2003-10-29 10:57:00,3206,Thanks guys.....this is very helpful. I'm in the process of contacting some of the suggestions now.
535417,2746,2003-10-19 12:02:00,3206,Have a group that wants to fish LOTW next June and camp in motor homes. I fish Canada regularly but always in the LacSuel/Red Lake area so not familiar with LOTW. Know June will be a tough time to find space. We will also be bringing our own boats and would like place to dock boats. Any suggestions?
535421,Guest,2003-10-19 14:10:00,0,Try Mylie's Place or Buena Vista in Morson. I think they have campgrounds.
535427,kenora99,2003-10-19 21:24:00,3,Check into http://www.kenoraontario.net It has a good listing of places for trailers.
535428,bellbuoy,2003-10-19 21:26:00,490,Laughing Water Trailer Park @ Sioux Narrows looks like a nice campground. http://www.laughingwaterpark.com Bellbuoy
535430,BD,2003-10-20 07:00:00,739,"I second Laughing Water Trailer Park. It is a great place to camp and fish. The trailer park / campground and Lake Of The Woods Houseboats are run by Dan and Noreen Luce. Dan will tell you where the fish are and what they are biting on, the rest is up to you. Our group has been houseboating every June for the last fifteen years and have allways been treated very well. If not we would not have come back for year number two. http://www.lowhouseboats.com"
535433,Guest,2003-10-20 12:43:00,0,I would recommed Red Wing Resort in Morson. They have everything you will need. It is not as crowded as Buena Vista. TGG
535438,balsl6,2003-10-20 21:15:00,426,"I would suggest Youngs Bay Resort at the NW Angle you can fish Mn, and Ontario. They are great people and and have a real nice, clean, campground and marina. You can find there number at the web site below.www.lakeofthewoodsresorts.com"
535464,PJM,2003-10-23 15:59:00,3516,The Great Guide Redwing is a nice resort and the location ok but Mike is not really in tune with walleye fishing and is not very friendly sometimes. I have stayed at both and if you don't know the lake the guys at Buena Vista will help you out.
535503,Guest,2003-10-26 19:40:00,0,"Mylie's is the best place in Morson in my opinion and I've stayed at them all. They have 20 foot slips on all their floating docks and the guy running it there (Justin, who takes care of everyone so well) was telling me they plan to uprade the rest of the RV sites to have 30 amp RV plugs. Combine that with their great NE facing location and sheltered bay, it's no wonder they are almost always full. Give them a call and book it if they have room for you."
535504,Guest,2003-10-26 19:46:00,0,You can check them out at ( http://www.myliesplace.com ) I won't stay anywhere else anymore.
