535545,mrwalleye5,2003-10-30 07:24:00,1922,As you can see by the lack of replies to your post the action on the Red in very poor. Infact I have put my boat away for the season and I live only one hour away from Selkirk. I feel at this time the chances of not catching greenbacks outweights the chance of catching. It's getting to the time of year that waiting til later is not going to happen.

535554,Slayer,2003-10-30 10:01:00,41,"I've read all the bad press on the Greenback bite through the fall. Actually, for a few of us, we have found the Red to be more productive this year than the last 2 fall seasons. I'm still getting out there. Not catching many over 28 inches, but getting a lot of g'backs none the less. Biggest this year 30.5 inches. ""Slayer"""
535556,Guest,2003-10-30 10:10:00,0,"I have only been to the Red once this year. Not great success because it was a little bit early in the season. I have always found the Red to produce the larger greenbacks than PF. And the Red makes for relaxed fishin'....you anchor, bait your hook, pour a coffee and wait them out....and when a greenback on the Red takes your bait....gotta hold tight 'cause it's gonna be a big one!!!"
