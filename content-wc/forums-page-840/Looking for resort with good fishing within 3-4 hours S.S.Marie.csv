535448,Guest,2003-10-21 18:04:00,0,First Canada trip went to Biscotasing last year. Great resort and people but mediocre fishing. Would not prefer fly-in but would consider. Thanks.
535505,Rich B,2003-10-26 21:04:00,1081,"I would recommend www.campkuha.com Tunnell Lake has nice walleye, northern pike (my son caught an 18 lb pike two summers ago), good smallmouth bass and is a very clean lake with a nice size river feeding it. Camp is fairly new, with log cabins, sauna, and very clean. I've gone up 4 years now with family & friends. This camp is only two hours east/north-east of SS Marie. I found out about this camp the first year it opened from it's website on a search, and after checking it out, have been going up once or twice a year since. Very nice owners. Rich B."
535510,Guest,2003-10-27 11:10:00,0,"Rich, a couple ?'s if you don't mind. Is this the only camp on the lake? How is the boat traffic? Any more insight on Walleye size and numbers? Lots of families and activities on the website, would you recomend to a group who would do nothing but fish all day? Sorry to bombard you but trying to plan ahead for next fall. Thanks!"
535526,Guest,2003-10-28 17:03:00,0,"Yeah, good questions. Everyone is looking for something different. I enjoy the hunt and challenge of looking for fish but I take a nephew that is more of a novice and would appreciate more numbers than we found at Biscotasing."
535527,Rich B,2003-10-28 17:24:00,1081,"FIB, I go up with my son (now age 18) and other guys that fish all day pretty hard......our group has caught walleye up to 8-9 lbs, with the average fish 1 1/-2 - 2 lbs, though they have their share of trophy walleyes in the lake. I hooked and lost a huge walleye up river from the camp this summer (well over 10 lbs anyway.......hey it looked closer to 12lbs, but then there's no photos to dispute my version - LOL) My son (and he's quick to point it out) has caught the largest walleye up to 8+ lbs every year. I personally have caught 4-5 smallmouth over 5 lbs, and a number in the 2-3 lb range......pike are anywhere from 2-5 lbs, unless you target them (they're deeper after Spring) and you can get into a trophy (my son caught one that was 18 lbs......can you start to see a pattern ?) This camp is run by a retired orthopaedic doctor and his wife, and they run it as a ""family camp"". They're not interested in having guys come in and drink hard and be loud (if you know what I mean - they cater more to families, though this is a quality fishing lake). The only other accommodations on Tunnell Lake are several private cottages (8 - 10 ?) at the east end, as well as a small campground of maybe 20 (?) campsites, that are used by locals. Most days during the week, you won't see anyone on the water other than from Camp Kuha. However, they have only (4) cabins to rent out any one week, so if you're interested, you need to book quickly after the first of the year, as they fill up fast. The lake is very safe to run (I towed in my 1900 Pro-V this year, and a buddy towed in his 620 last year), has a decent ramp where the owner will ramp your boat.....the camp also rents decent boats if you need to rent one for the week. Is very clean, and if you are looking for a camp where you can take your wife and family (if they don't mind true peace and quiet)....very clean and the website doesn't do the camp justice. Email me if you have any other questions.....I've had a number of my good fishing buddies go up, and they've all enjoyed the trip. Faith, Family, Friends............and Fishing ! Rich B."

535620,michric,2003-11-09 07:53:00,46,"Thanks Kent. That was a good tip. Except that I forgot to specify northeast Ontario. Sure is fun, though to look at some of those places in northwest Ontario. Too much drive for my schedule right now."
