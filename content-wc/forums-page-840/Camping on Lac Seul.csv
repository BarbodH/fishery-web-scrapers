535596,eyewitness,2003-11-05 12:55:00,680,I know that Canadien citizens can camp on Lac Seul. Can I come up from the US and camp as long as I'm with a Canadien? Are there only certain areas that are approved for camping or can you go wherever it looks appropriate on the lake? Any Canadiens here up on the laws for this?

I beleive Lac Seul is posted, and they really don't care who you are with. I would think the MNR ofice in Dryden would be the correct one to contact, 807-223-3341, they should be able to answer you for sure."
535602,Guest,2003-11-05 19:23:00,0,Was told by others that you can camp in areas like sunlight lake which is connected to Lac Suel by going up altimeter creek. Wonder what the difference is when you rent a house boat and park it on the lake??
