535577,MrEyes,2003-11-03 12:37:00,360,"I was wondering if people could give me some info on fishing Lac Seul. 1) What is a good time to go? 2) When is to EARLY (like taking a chance with still having ice, or the low water temps). 3) When would the Black fly's be bad? 4) Do you have to use live bait? Can plastics work as good? 5) Anything else you can give me? I am looking at heading back up to Canada. It's been a couple of years and I'm taking a buddy up North, who has never fished Canada. I'm looking at staying at Evergreen Lodge. Is there anything good or bad I should know about this lodge? Mark"
535578,Guest,2003-11-03 13:09:00,0,Check out www.sww-lodge.com/fish.htm this site has a record of fish caught for this Lodge on Lac seul and explains techniques for catching various species.
535582,Guest,2003-11-04 07:18:00,0,My group likes the first two weeks in June. We have good luck with both live bait and plastics at this time. We have had good luck with bugs during this time frame as well. bookings are at a premium during this time so book early. Evergreen has a great reputation so if you can get a booking with them I would go for it. A great site to check out is silver water wheel logde. I'm not sure of the web address but do a search and you will find it. They keep records on the fish they catch so you can see for yourself when the best fishing is. Good luck.
535585,Guest,2003-11-04 13:11:00,0,I have been fishing Lac seul for the past 15 years out of Evergreen. Real nice people and excellant accomodations and equipment. I always enjoy my time there.
535587,Guest,2003-11-04 20:11:00,0,"Uncle Al, When do you go to Evergreen? We will be going there for our first time June 26,2004. Have fished the South end of Lac Seul for the last ten years. Hope the fishing is has good at Evergreen as it has been the last ten years."
535591,MrEyes,2003-11-05 10:30:00,360,"I booked a trip with Evergreen (May 22-29) and they did not have many dates left. So I hope this lodge is as good as I've herd. Also, I understand the lodge is located 1 mile away from town. Is there a place to get something to Drink/Eat (maybe a beer and burger) that someone can recommend? How big is the town? Thanks Mark"
535592,Guest,2003-11-05 10:54:00,0,"Mike Kansas , Yes I will be there and yes the fishing is as good as everyone says. Yes there is a place to get a drink and a burger in town. The Trillium has very good food and drinks are available. You are lucky to get a spot at Evergreen. I think they are full most of the summer."
535598,Guest,2003-11-05 15:13:00,0,"Uncle Al, I gather that you will be at Evergreen the week of June 26, 2004. If so we look forward to meeting you."
