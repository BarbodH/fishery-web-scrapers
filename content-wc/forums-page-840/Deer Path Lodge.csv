I am wondering if there are people who have stayed there and what their thoughts are about this lodge. Nice place, pleasant owner, location, etc. What is fishing like on Vermillion and Webster? Also, is Lac Suel accessible by boat from the lodge or do we need to pull them up to Deception Landing? We will be there in June. Any info you can share would be appreciated. Otts"

You will need to trailer to deception or lost lake if you want to fish Lac Seul. Don't discount Big Vermilion. It has lots of Lakers and as many smallmouth as you'd want to catch in a day, especially in June. I'm talking 100-200 fish days for smallies. An added bonus are the muskies that Vermilion offers. Unfortunately it isn't really a walleye lake, but it's worth spending a day or two on. I will be going back there this next year at least once. Enjoy, you made a good choice!"
535564,jimbo,2003-10-30 19:11:00,223,I have gone to Deer Path for several years now. I really like the place as Rick is the most helpful guy you will want to meet. His cabins are spotless. I wll be there the first part of June. Fish Vermillion if you want pike and lakers. I trailer to Lost Lake. You cannot go to lac Suel from Vermillion by boat. Don't forget your rain wear and warm clothes. If I can help E-mail me Jimbo

He has lived there his whole life and he will let you know where the good one's are biting. Fishing on big V is very good for bass and lakers, a short trip (5-7mins) for everything else on Lac Seul. Might see you there! Js."
