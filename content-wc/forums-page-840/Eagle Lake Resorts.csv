Can anyone who's been there tell me what to expect as far as accomodations, service, and (of course) the fishing. Everything looks great on a resort's web site---I'm looking for personal experiences. I'm looking at early June, and I fish for all (seasonal) species. Also, I'm open to any other resort on Eagle Lake. Thanks."

I've had good reports from guys that stay at South Shore Lodge and Pine Beach Resort. I stay every year at Temple Bay Lodge, more for the location than anything special to do with the lodge. North Shore has had good reports also, but from your previous post seems like they are tough to get a hold of. Keep in mind, this is vacation season for the lodge owners. Fishing season just ended and the sport shows are just around the corner."

Century Lodge would not be the place to go if you are looking for Good Walleye, Northern, Lake Trout. Check out Gords web site at www.vermilionbaylodge.com He runs a good place and it is clean and the boats are nice and kept up well."
