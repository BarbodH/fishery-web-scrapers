535307,Guest,2003-10-12 05:47:00,0,Are there any options for fishing Lake Winnipeg Greenbacks other than the Red & Winnipeg River Systems? How about other river systems in the fall? Does anyone fish the lake any other time of the year? I've been told it's dangerous water but sport fisherman are all over the Great Lakes without too many problems. Are they green all year or just during they're fall run? This is the first time in 12 yrs. I've skipped the fall run and I'm having severe withdrawl symtoms that can only be cured with a Greenback or two. Eygore
535309,Guest,2003-10-12 08:48:00,0,"Yes the big lake can be dangerous, but as you pointed out so are the great lakes........ The problem with Lake Winnipeg is access. Unlike the Great Lakes which has access points practically at every nook and crany, this isn't the case with Lake Winnipeg. It is estimated by the province that the vast majority of walleye spend the summer months in the north basin of the lake. This is where access becomes a major stumbling block for there are no roads around the north basin that are remotely close to the lake. This is sad, for if there was access up there, we'd be able to take advantage of one of the world's most incredible trophy walleye fisheries year round.......now would that be any good! Picture Lake Erie only with much bigger fish! As for the color, absolutely, they're green all the time. The iridescent green that these walleye display and have become so renowned for is due to the acidity levels of limestone in the lake. Even the channel cats that are fresh in off the lake display incredible greeny/gold colors. Many of the lakes fish display signs or hints of green, but none hold a candle to the lakes walleye. One can't help to ponder about the huge potentials of Lake Winnipeg as a sport fishery. Could you imagine what it's economic value would be if there was access into the north basin! There would be resorts popping up all over it and they'd all have potential to succeed. This is a topic that some of us have kicked around for many years now. There are those of us that would love to see the opportunity for a sport fishery to be developed on the big lake, the potentials would be practically unlimited....... Fish ""HARD"" Forever!"
535314,Guest,2003-10-12 12:31:00,0,"Stu, Thanks for the info. I'm guessing that someone has found away to fish the big water. Have you ever heard of anyone sport fishing in the Hecla Island area? It looks like a chance to catch the schools moving through a confined area. I, unfortunately, don't have the time or resources to experiment at this theory. Perhaps in retirement, Eyegore"

535337,Guest,2003-10-13 09:09:00,0,"The Hecla Island region of L.W. is still in the south basin. The north basin where it is said that walleye spend the summer months has very limited access. The following are the ""only"" access points where one drive to in order to gain access onto the north basin......Matheson Island, which is located at the extreme north end of the channel or extreme south end of the north basin. By the way L.W. is actually made up of two expanses of water, the north and south basin. The north basin is truly massive, it's nearly 200 miles long and 60 miles wide! The south basin from the Red River to Hecla Island is approximately 50 miles long by 20 miles in width. The next access point would be ""Jackhead"" which is actually a First Nation. Travelling many miles north, the next available access would be Dauphin River, which is also a First Nations. Finally we come to the last road access to Lake Winnipeg......Grand Rapids, which is located near the north end of the lake. Actually Grand Rapids has been a popular angling destination for generations and from the information I've gathered recently, it fished well this past summer. For many years the big lake has weighed heavy on my mind. One can't help but let one's imagination run wild because of the enormous potentials that the lake has concealed since it's beginning. It has all the right ingredients to become an icon in the world of sport fishing, unfortunately it's my beliefs that the emorous potentials of Lake Winnipeg will never be realized .....at least not in my time. Fish ""HARD"" Forever!"
535338,Guest,2003-10-13 10:23:00,0,"What about access at Grand Rapids, Manitoba which is located at the mouth of Cedar Lake on the west shore between Long Point and Horse Island. It would appear that the Cedar Lake entrance might support some Greenbacks. Does anyone have names of any Lodges or outfitters on Cedar Lake?"
535341,Guest,2003-10-13 12:03:00,0,"Cedar Lake has a tremendous walleye fishery. My good friend Don Lamont who hosts ""The Complete Angler"" TV show has made of couple of trips up there this past season. His results were very positive on both occasions........lots of walleye and lots of northerns. However these 'eyes aren't tied into Lake Winnipeg's fishery therefore they're not greenbacks. Cedar Lake is actually a man made resevoir, it's actually the tailwaters of the North Saskatchewan River. It is cut-off from Lake Winnipeg by the dam (it's creator) at Grand Rapids. If you recall a couple of years ago the news broke out about the giant pike that was caught by a native commercial fisher, or how about the skellitory remains of a 40"" walleye that was caught and filleted by an American bear hunter. It was estimated that this walleye could have weighed more than twenty pounds? Hey Mike sorry your trip didn't pan out for this year, there are some enjoying some success here on the Red, maybe it will pick-up, then again maybe it won't. I guess we'll just have to wait and see. One thing for sure the weather has cooperated so far. Maybe that's another consideration we should be taking into account, but then again maybe we shouldn't......there sure is a lot of maybe's in our daily routine of trying to figure out our fisheries isn't there!"
535343,Guest,2003-10-13 13:18:00,0,"Stu, One item for consideration that was suggested to me is that the Lake has a large population of Smelt in it. This population of Smelt has been increasing and the source believes that the fish have ample forage in the Lake with the Smelt and therefore have less reason to inhabit the Red or Pine Falls. Does this make sense to you?"
535365,Guest,2003-10-14 06:51:00,0,"I can't buy into the smelt theory Mike because of the information I've received from our Manitoba Fisheries Department. Over the years I've been trying to get a better handle on how Lake Winnipeg's smelt fishery is developing. Unfortunately our department is seriously lacking the funds that would provide it to be able to conduct some serious studies on smelt in the lake. The department has to rely on other sources to obtain information on the smelt and how they co-exist with preditors such as walleye, pike and channel cats in the lake. One such source they've adapted is to monitor the commercial fleets harvest from the north basin. In doing so they've found high concentrations of smelt in the stomach's of pike, the same cannot be for the findings inside the stomach's of the walleye that are sampled. Walleye do not appear to be consuming smelt to any noticeable degree......Based on those findings I find it hard to point the finger at the theory that smelt are to blame, this is only one man's opinion..... Fish ""HARD"" Forever!"
535571,Guest,2003-10-31 07:13:00,0,"Waldi, Thanks for the Greenback update. Have you fished Cedar very much and if so have you done well? Where do you stay if you fish Cedar. Thanks again for the info. Mike"
535572,chrism,2003-10-31 16:29:00,429,"Mike I fish Cedar 40-50 days a year, year round - it is still a good bet for great fishing, although now that the word is out, there is a LOT more traffic than in the past. When the bite is on, and you learn how to fish that water, it's real easy to land 250-300lbs of walleye a day per boat. There are 3 lodges on the lake, Cross bay resort, Moak lodge, and Hobbs resort. I think you can get their info either on the net or by phoning them. I think there is still a chance that you can get a cabin at one of those place for next year. As for greenies, they are in the river, but not in Cedar itself - like previously mentioned a lot of people hit the river when Cross bay is howling. I have heard on many occasions that the bit picks up when the current is stronger, but I have yet to see any size to the fish - most seem to be around 16-18"". Hope this helps cm"

I go there onece in a summer ,allways with great succes.But my favorite time is last week in April for Ice fishing.You fish 50 to100 yards from shore and catch all the fish you want.Out of the same hole and with the same lure you catch pike,walley,perch,tulibi and whitefish.I have seen masterangler fish of all this spiecies comming out in one day."
535566,Guest,2003-10-30 21:05:00,0,"HI Mike, last year in august we fisched Cedar lake in Grand Rapids.Due to stormy weather on the lake we decided to fisch the river in Grand Rapids ,which goes from LW to the damm (Cedar lake).To the surprise of all of us we started to catch nice Greenbacks,lots.Later we found out that Manitoba Hydro has lifted the curtains at the damm(they do that ocassionaly) so tere was some curent in the river wich stimulated the greenbacks to enter the river.So much for other options for Greenbaks"
