535604,Guest,2003-11-06 02:30:00,0,"We used to take a half dozen, or so, trips a year fishing for northern and some trips were really productive. Rarely, however did we ever catch anything approaching 30"". The biggest change has been a result of the zebra mussels which have filtered the water to gin clarity. As a result, tactics we once used (casting shallow weed beds, bait/bobber rigs, etc.) are much less effective except under extreme conditions like early/late season windswept and turbulent, murky water. Good fishing can still be had by adjusting techniques to the conditions. Nowadays we do more deep water jigging and drifting with live bait near shoal areas. In the spring and fall the bays can still get hot but, once again, you can forget about trophy-sized fish. On the plus side, the fishing for smallmouth remains absolutely terrific and boating 50 or more fish in an outing is a common occurance. Fall seems to produce bigger fish and the standard St. Lawrence method of slip-rigging a minnow or worm seems to outshine all other techniques although tube jigs and power baits can hook 'em up pretty good when their active. Lately, another species has become a bit more prominent, particularly in the fall and that's our ol' friend, the walleye. We are still doing a lot of ""research"" into this matter. In a nutshell: Go for the smallies and get a Cnadian license because there are some super spots on the northern side of the big river."
