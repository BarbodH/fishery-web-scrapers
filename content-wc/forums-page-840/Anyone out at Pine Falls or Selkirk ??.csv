535593,Guest,2003-11-05 11:50:00,0,Has anyone been out this week at either Pine Falls or Selkirk (Red River) ? Looking for any info on ice forming on the Red at Selkirk or mill launch at Pine Falls. Is it still possible to launch a boat ? I'm subborn and I want to go out fishing yet !!! Thanks for any info.

535649,Guest,2003-11-12 16:30:00,0,"Fools ?? Check on the net for ice safety. You need 2"" of ice to support a person. At 4"" you can move around safely. 8"" you can drive a car. I have fished on 1.5"" with not even a cracking sound....drove half ton truck on 6"". But wandering around this early you best know your water...awful lot of thin spots around yet. The warm temps. coming will slow ice formation."
