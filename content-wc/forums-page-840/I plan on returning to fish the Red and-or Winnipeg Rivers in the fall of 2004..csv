That does not mean I will not go back, just that I will no longer make reservations and gather the crowd starting in June. If I get to a day and the reports are good, and I have time, and there is a room available, I can be there in 5 hours. Haven't been there this year, and don't feel like I really missed much. One thing is certain though. Even when the bite is bad, you know at any time you COULD hook the fish of a lifetime. They are there, and to catch one you need to be in the game. Thinking I am going to replace the Pine Falls trip with an Erie or Columbia River trip. Seems like it might be a nice alternative. The drive will be more though."

535551,Todd_NE,2003-10-30 09:39:00,1330,"Sounds good, I sorta kinda plan to go again next year but I know it's tough to predict the weather. I've always thought of going up to Pine Falls/Selkirk like a trophy deer hunt, not numbers of fish anyway. When it's on, there is fishing like nowhere else! Todd Yup, got her... oh yeah... feel that head shake!"
535599,Reels,2003-11-05 16:23:00,2876,"After getting back from the WC Get together, I think I am going to spend more time on Lake Erie Next year. Nothing like 8,9,10lb fish on a regular basis. Our smallest fish was 5 lbs. Your heart really starts to go when you see a planer board go under water!! <{{}}><"
