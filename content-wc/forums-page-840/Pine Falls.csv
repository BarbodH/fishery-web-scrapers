535495,Guest,2003-10-26 08:17:00,0,Made our annual trip to the river and was dissapointed again. I have fished this area for I believe 18 years and have had some great trips over the years but the last several years have been close to a bust. We fished Thursday and Friday managed 4 fish between 22-25 inches along with a bunch of dinks. Talked to many fisherman and most caught only dinks along with maybe one keeper. I will not return to the area until I hear that something has been done with the nets and that they are releasing water at the dam like in the good old days. I love those greenbacks but it is too far to drive from Nebraska for a couple of fish. I am considering Tobin next year any advise???? Goodluck to all
535496,Guest,2003-10-26 13:36:00,0,BKT Your right about Pine Falls...it sucked.. (actually last year too). I'm from Winnipeg and Pine Falls is an hour and half away. Done just a bit of fishing there in the fall. Talked to alot of people here and they agree...fishing sucks there. I have been out all week at Selkirk (Red River)... it is slow but steady.. at least there are boats catching some nice Wallys but tons of boats out..(crowded). Since you are coming a long way why not plan a spring trip and go further up north?? Early spring fishing is just fantastic. No 10lb. walleye but we have no problem catching 250 eating Walleye in an afternoon (3 people)C+R..few for snack. Then there are the Northern Pike....Monsters.. 3feet+ !!! If that gets boring...go for Lake Trout!! You will never be dissapointed up north (Thomson..The Pas...etc.) See what happens here next year...put my boat away in August if fall fishing dosn't improve.
535506,Guest,2003-10-26 22:34:00,0,"Agree, Just retuned from our yearly trip to Pine Flls. Heard everything from too warm, we arrived to early/late, etc. Have always liked talking business with some local business folks and I mentioned to them they are on the way to a huge decline in visitors unless they get involved in the fishing. Our motel was full of people not returning and the motel said their yearly confirms from repeat people like us are way down for next year already. I wish the good business folks of Pine Falls luck because the fishing does not warrant a special trip and won't unit someone is convincing enough to make major changes to how the system is run.

535507,Guest,2003-10-27 06:35:00,0,"Wow, Sat night there were only 3 boats at the Papertown. We were the only ones for supper. Had the worst trip ever. No fish caught. Headed to the Red on Sunday and talked to a few folks before we decided if we should go home or fish. Only 2-3 fish per group."
535511,Guest,2003-10-27 11:40:00,0,"Greetings gents. I agree the fishing has been slow again this year.....BUT, I feel for the folks who drive all the way from south of the border. I do not want you to go home discouraged. I WANT TO HELP! I was out on Friday for 6 hours and managed three decent sized greenbacks (two 26"" and one 25""). Also caught another 14 fish ranging in size from 14 to 20""....nice eaters. On Friday I used a chartreuse 3/8 oz jig with live minnow. Deadsticking worked the best. I WILL ADMIT IT WAS SLOW....AND I DIDN'T CATCH ANY ""MONSTERS""....BUT FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WENT HOME WITHOUT ANY FISH....I WANT TO HELP!!! Up by the dam on the east side about 400 yards downstream of the point. 18' of water. Anchored and deadsticking. Caught all my big ones there in the morning. Also, drifted through at Star's Point. I WAS THE ONLY GUY THERE! ALL THESE GUYS WERE OUT ON THE LAKE....NO FISH REPORTED!!!. I caught most of my fish Star's Point. Also try up by the dam on the hump on the west side. Caught a couple there at the end of the day. IF YOU ARE GOING OUT ON TUESDAY, LOOK FOR ME BY THE DAM IN THE MORNING. I will be in a 16' Starcraft with an Orange Mustang suit. I REALLY LIKE SEEING ALL THE VISITORS FISHING OUR WATER AND WANT YOU TO KEEP COMING BACK! Tight lines!"
535515,Guest,2003-10-27 16:14:00,0,"In response to tobin lake, have been going to pine falls for about ten years and have seen the decline in fish being caught do-to-the lack of water being let out and also the netting that is going on but what can you do but go somewhere-else and that is what we did we went to tobin lake and had one of the best trips we have ever had. With the regulations that they have up there fishing will be good for as long as I can see. We caught about 200 fish in 8 days of fishing and the 75% of the fish were over 6 pounds now that is great fishing. Weather is not much of an issue up there the wind will not blow you of the river which that is all we fished."
535523,Guest,2003-10-28 12:07:00,0,"In reply to gms question as to sources. I fished both tournaments, the first tournament was a rough go. Big fish were very limited we all know that. Pre fished for second tournament next week and got blown off the bay 2 last days. Fishing in the river prior to 2nd tournament was still tough. As mentioned earlier we went to Bryere's piont last on left before bay and watched people whale on big fish all day, talk to anyone that was there. Day we went to a spot on the bay and had a great day caught just beatiful fish. Big fish were caught all day that is a fact. Some people were not on fish that is for sure but alot of people were. Got a phone call from the guys from in fisherman monday they asked me if it was worth comming out, I said yes the bite is on, "" i mean we just had one of the best days on the bay that i have had in years"" They showed up monday night Oct 20th fished the 21 and 22 they caught huge fish the show is going to be great. NOW if I didn't think these guys were going to catch fish no way would they have been here. In fact on 2 other occasions this year fall I called and told them to wait till later. As far as what has been going on since, Dan Stier has been here for 2 weeks or so, I talk to him every day. He tells me what he is catching on and where. Tournaments are over information is not hard to get. Now if you are asking me if the last 3 years have been normal, not a chance. But as far as posting BS not a chance, just read some of my early posts this year."
535528,gms,2003-10-28 19:45:00,91,"Laurent I'm not suggesting the report at Bruyere's point was BS as I was there last Tuesday and boated 9 nice ones myself, I'm looking more at the overall lack of production/consistency. I too have been in the Pine Falls tournements, fortunately in some of the exceptional years! I do admitthere are some guys who just know how to find them better than most....Fawcett/Powell, Carlson/Stewner, Christianson's May have given up for this year.....but will be back again for more tries. If there are some that are not coming back to the PaperTown next year, I'd love to take up a spot as it has been hard to get a room in previous years....and if the fishing is bad then I can ride the water slide all day! Sorry if might have ruffled some feathers...no harm was intended."
535531,Guest,2003-10-29 08:20:00,0,"There is a group of us that are going to make a real attempt at seeing that commercial fishermen are accoutable for what is going on on lake winnipeg. Many conversations have taken place with people in the right places to see that changes will be made.... This is extremely important to both us and people who make a living on the lake. To my knowledge studies have been completed and have not been made public as to the status of the lake. When asked when the study will be made public, it was stated that "" we are waiting for the right time"". If you are asking me the time is now and lets do something about it. We have to be optimistic as to being able to make changes, although we all know that this will be challenging. We have one of the best fisheries in the world and have no choice but to preserve it. Wish us luck, and I will keep people posted as to what is going on as meetings progress."
535537,Backwater Eddy,2003-10-29 11:31:00,3871,"Laurent if the MB Fisheries keep dismissing CO's and personnel like they are now. They will soon have nobody left to present that report. ;) Ed ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson ><,sUMo,>"
535540,gms,2003-10-29 15:33:00,91,"Laurent In these studies/report, does it address the potential impact that the Aboriginal fishing is making? Or do you think this is inconsequential compared to the mark being made by legitimate commercial fishermen."
535542,Guest,2003-10-29 18:02:00,0,"fished sunday...oct 26th went to the lake and jigged the channel at first nothing went and trolled 930-1230 3 18-20"" hit the river... 1st drop a 27"" then a bunch of 18- 23"" with 1 more 26.5"" no big ones backtroll and slow pull jigs with live ones from 14-22' deep both big fish in 20' 3 guys 15 walleye's 2 norton's"
535548,Guest,2003-10-30 08:31:00,0,"Laurent: Talking to, Dave Fitzjohn (Man Conservation), Dave Bergman (Freshwater Fish Marketing Corporation) and Alan Kristopherson (Freshwater Institute) It has come to our attention that the only report that is coming out from the ""people"" who have the power to effect changes with regards to the use of Lake WPG and the two major rivers to the south is a review of Scientific datum collected during the 2001 season by the Freshwater Institute. There are no other reports being released by any of the organizations mentioned above. In addition we were also told that commercial fishing will continue at present levels and no change is forcasted. What organization are you talking about? What group are you referring to what people in the right places have been spoken to? The minister of Conservation (Steve Ashton) was contacted yesterday and his secretary said no report on commercial fishing was pending. I applaud your sentiments but as has been mentioned on other boards the problem is to get folks like yourself and other people who make their living from the resource together to form a united voice on the issue. We have seen these sentiments already on the fishing Manitoba website and the difficulty was pointed out... http://members3.boardhost.com/fishma.../msg/9199.html Critic[email protected] Ted Lipinski[email protected]"
535553,Guest,2003-10-30 09:53:00,0,"I have not read the study, so I do not know what is on it. As far as its origination, ""does it exist"" yes. Will it be helpful I hope so. As to the group of people involved, they can let themselves be known if they choose. Not that this is a great big secret but I am not going to speak for other people. I am on board and will do what it takes for the future of the fishery, for my kids, my kids kids, love of fishing, business the list goes on and on..........."
535535,REELMAN,2003-10-29 09:58:00,1624,"Laurent I hope you can get the netting and commercial fishing straightened out up there. I wish you luck, I think you will need it fighting those involved. I do plan on coming back next year. We had another fun trip. Fished the Red River each day we were there. The one day we planned on fishing the Winnipeg the wind kept us off. I really enjoy the people of Pine Falls and love your motel. The water slide was a riot. Only road it a few times as it scared the heck out of me.!!!! The hot tub was also nice after a cold day on the water. To me a good trip involves more than slaughtering the 10 lber's. Cold beer, good food and fellowship with my fellow anglers play a definite roll also. See you next year.!~"
535449,cbprov,2003-10-21 18:10:00,1010,"the nets in the river are chechking the white sucker pop,we talked to the fisheries about them on sat,they are not comm nets"
535452,Guest,2003-10-22 05:26:00,0,The commercial nets are farther out in the bay by Elk Island. Hey CBPROV are you from Quebec?
535453,Guest,2003-10-22 06:49:00,0,Wait for me! lol. I'm reading this while I am in Ontario and can't wait to get back. I will be heading out this weekend for some trout in Georgian Bay. Good luck to all the hog hunters. Mike
535458,mrwalleye5,2003-10-22 19:28:00,1922,"Just got back from Pine Falls. Fishing is improving. Fished for 12 hours in two days ( got blown off today ) and caught 14 greenbacks. 4 18"", 5 20"", 2 22"", 1 24"", 1 25"" and 1 28.5"" Fished in Traverse most of the time pulling cranks. I noticed one thing that kind of hurt, my buddy caught 12 of these, I caught 2. He used a minnow coloured shad rap with no rattles and I used rattles. W5"
535463,Guest,2003-10-23 14:33:00,0,Fished today out on Traverse Bay. Too Sad!! Fished out at the far rock pile (don't know the name) Still dark trolling cranks....Nothing. Tried drifting jigs...nothing...tried anchoring with jigs...nothing. Other boats arrived trying different methods..trolling...drifting..anchored as well.. about 25 boats. We left at 11:30 and seen one boat catch about a 5lb geenback...he was anchored. Did better this week at Selkirk by Doc Reeds place.
535465,mrwalleye5,2003-10-23 17:44:00,1922,"If it wasn't for my partner catching nearly all the fish I would have said it was pretty sad too. I never fished Pine Falls or the Red River when it was in its hay day but I know I wouldn't travel a great distance to fish either of these ""fisheries"". Luckily I'm only two hours away but even at that I'm not waisting my time for either. It's too much of a crap shoot. One thing worth mentioning is that the water temp is still between 50 and 51 degrees. Maybe still not cold enough? But with having said this you just have to fish the Red for catfish. What a blast. W5"
535468,timeout,2003-10-23 22:40:00,28,"If you get tired of the cats, try the carp. Targetted them specificaly this year for the first time. Doesn't beat the beauty of a sparkling greenback but when the big ones take, it can be like hooking onto a moving vehicle. A real blast and a whole lot easier (in the proper season)than it is catching QUALITY walleye this year."
535469,Guest,2003-10-23 23:13:00,0,Was out at Pine Falls today Oct 23..Yes it is tough but I managed to get 5 Greenbacks with the largest weighing in at 11 pounds.For some the 11 might have been worth the trip .I am optomistic that things will only improve as the fall carries on..Good Luck to all who try
535475,Guest,2003-10-24 12:16:00,0,"Large fish are being caught daily in the bay. Fish seemed to have moved into deeper water only hanging on structure for short periods in the morning. 20- 24 feet of water during day periods. Fish are definitaly there. Vertical jigging 3/8 jig and nice shinners Some people are having limited success on cranks, fish in river are there but it seems that trophies are more common in the bay. Although things can change in a day. To the guy that just caught an 11 lber this week ""right on"" good to see, most people go through there entire life time without catching a 10"
535489,gms,2003-10-25 19:14:00,91,"Laurent I'd be curious to know your sources for information and how credible they may be. In 8 times out there this fall, we have yet to see any action that would even warrant a claim that ""they're here"". If you want ""official"" information, you should look at the tourney results. The locals I have spoken with tell me that my experiences are quite consistent with what they are seeing. As a matter of fact today I spoke to 4 groups coming out at the launch and amongst us all....only 2 greenback were caught. Moved to Manitou Rapids and the 3 boats around us never caught a fish either? That accounts for about 40% of the boats there. I can't count how many annoyed US visitors I have talked to that were soured by their visit. One today even noted that he was cutting his trip short and going home because it is so bad. Would love to here from the other 60% out there today, I'd bet dollars to doughnuts that they had a poor day"
535418,Guest,2003-10-19 12:49:00,0,"The bite is on, some huge fish were caught on the lake and in the river. We fish Breyers point day one and watched people haul in some monsters all around us. Every time we would decide to change spots another would come out. Day 2 we went on the lake and had one of the best days I have had out there in a while. 29 1/2, 28, numerous in the 24 to 27 range. We just had a great time, A friend of mine caught his two fish over 28 "" day one, which does not allow you to catch any over 28"" day two. He goes back to the same spot catches a 29 1/2 and a 28 1/4 and has to let them go. It didn't matter how many time he measured those fish they would not shrink. Its been a couple of 2 year since I've seen fish like that on the flats."
535419,Guest,2003-10-19 13:14:00,0,"I concur with Laurent. I was out there on Saturday. No huge fish but lots in the 20"" to 25"" range. Was an awesome day Roger"
535420,Guest,2003-10-19 14:07:00,0,good to hear things are picking up. Where are the flats you refer to?
535423,Guest,2003-10-19 18:33:00,0,">good to hear things are picking up. Where are the flats you >refer to? Yes, please tell us. I've fished there with a friend more than a few times. There are flats neat the ####, and there are flats where 89 boats go to crank."

535432,Guest,2003-10-20 11:39:00,0,I think he was referring to keeping an over 28 inch fish to weigh for the tournament. The Tourney was a catch and release event.

535447,Guest,2003-10-21 17:12:00,0,I didnt see any nets on the bay or at the mouth of the river. There were 8 or so nets along the river. Will be heading up again on saturday looking for the big ones! Roger
