535611,Guest,2003-11-07 14:38:00,0,Took a drive today along the Red from Lockport to the End of Main. The river is frozen over just about everywhere. There is even ice amost right to the dam at Lockport. What surprised me was the fact that Netly Creek is wide open...ducks were swimming around. Only about 2 feet of thin ice around the shore. On the way home I stopped at a few spots and poked around at the ice near shore. Couldn't walk on it...very thin and soft. Spool the little rods...won't be long !!!!
