535600,Guest,2003-11-05 16:51:00,0,Has anyone been out at Pine Falls or Selkirk this past week ? Wondering about ice forming ? Are the boat launches still useable? Have 4x4 and lots of sand so ice on the launch isn't too much of a worry...more worried about ice forming along the shore. I know..I know...some people just don't know when to give up...I'm stubborn. Any info on either Selkirk or Pine falls is appreciated...Thanks
