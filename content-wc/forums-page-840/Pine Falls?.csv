535613,Guest,2003-11-08 07:14:00,0,was thinking the same thing for tuesday... locals told me yesterday that the shoreline is icebound.... and not to bother... this is from hardcore's that would be out if they could.... only chance is if you are a cartopper...

Keep posting any ""ice"" updates from the locals if you can. If you are interested in the NW Ontario/Minaki region, I have received confirmation that Louise Lake, Sandy Lake and apparently Muriel Lake already have ice across them. I will be heading out that way tomorrow morning so will have an update when I return on Tuesday."
