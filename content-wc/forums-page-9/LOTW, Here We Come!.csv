But this year, we're both healthy enough to make the trip.So, Friday, we head north. We are both ecstatic (and very thankful) that we are getting another chance to fish the lake again. If you happen to see a little white Alumacraft Classic scooting around the lake, be sure to wave!"

I know for us last year, that first shore lunch seemed to mark an end to the pandemic. I don't know that I have ever tasted better food than that first batch of walleye, fried potatoes, beans, and bread/butter. Have a great time, looking forward to your trip report. Our countdown is 7 days, as of now. Can't wait!"
