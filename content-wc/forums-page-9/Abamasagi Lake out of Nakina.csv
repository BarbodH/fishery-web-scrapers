6744031,Franco,2023-06-12 15:07:00,107,Thanks!! I might do that in the coming days…
6744035,uv2021,2023-06-12 15:17:00,48,We will be in cabin 1. Our plane touches down and uses the dock on cabin two because its deeper. So I will say hello on my way in and your way out. Last year we boated about 900 fish between 3 of us. We ate 35 .
6744049,Eckohlt,2023-06-12 15:39:00,3685,"I'll be leaving for melchett lake just north of Aba Thursday,be back next Friday.Any questions I'll reply you when I return home."
6744053,Franco,2023-06-12 15:56:00,107,That’s awesome. See you then!
6744087,andreindy,2023-06-12 18:53:00,308,"I have been in Aba 2 several times, usually the 2nd week of July. Due to scheduling, we are going to Saga for the first time July 7th with Twin Lake Outfitters. That will be interesting. Regarding the lake, and Aba 2, I have a few places that can get you started if you just want to catch something. One is really close to camp and they are humps that come up to 4 to 8 foot rock piles and drop to deeper water (see the map). We likes jigging these or honestly, just trolling crankbaits over the edges of the pile. Something smashes it on almost every pass. The river mouth is always fun and drifting with jigs/crawlers/plastics always produces quantity."
6744093,Franco,2023-06-12 19:13:00,107,That’s really helpful - thanks!!Wondering how the camp is…Any glaring deficiencies I should prepare for?
6744133,Eckohlt,2023-06-13 05:50:00,3685,"Nice cabin,good shower,water pump went out on us last sept the last 3 days,but I'm sure it's up n running now,you'll like the camp Franco,with just 3 of you going you'll have more room than you know what to do with,3 bed rooms."
