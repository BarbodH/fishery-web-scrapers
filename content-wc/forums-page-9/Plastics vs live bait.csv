6744777,emma17,2023-06-16 09:23:00,436,"My wife, Dawn, and I returned from Canada two weeks ago. Dawn is 100% jig (deadly w a blue Moon Eye) and minnow fisher. I made good on my goal to fish plastics. We both had a great trip and caught loads of fish. She had a stretch of 5 consecutive days w a 25 Walleye, plus two 27's sprinkled in. She pulled up dozens of 20-24 fish right under the boat in 6'-12' of water. I went full bore plastics and felt I needed to cast/retrieve for the greatest chance. I did very well, but largest Walleye was 24 (ouch!). I used paddle tail and split tail. I noticed greater success w Northern Pike on split tail. The other unexpected thing I experienced was getting a bite when I let the paddle tail sit at the bottom after it descended. I figured all bites would be reaction on the way down, but many occurred at the bottom. I did go through some slumps and went to live bait occasionally, but 90% plastic. When I got home I ordered a couple dozen more plastics, so I guess I'm in the conversion stage."
6744881,prov1800,2023-06-17 05:49:00,5010,"Yesterday I took a guest out on Clay Lake for mainly pike.We had a good day with around couple dozen pike in all sizes.Which to walleye fishing and some bass here and there and we both had a heyday throwing cranks at them Still amazing how shallow they still are.bass are right in the rocks and seemed walleyes on the edge in 2 ft.As soon as I cranked it down would catch a walleye.Again tried a 2"" paddle tail with limited luck.Stuck with the crank bait.water Temps 68f and no sign of mayflies"
6744889,kzoofisher,2023-06-17 06:53:00,5144,"How did you fish the paddle tail? Straight retrieve, slow jig, fast rips?"
6744891,prov1800,2023-06-17 07:04:00,5010,Every which way.caught a few.Caught a few faster with rubber on a road runner style jig.Minnows was every cast and so was the crank.My guest I had threw a little cleo in and if he didn't get hung up he'd catch a walleye or a bass.
6744907,emma17,2023-06-17 09:29:00,436,Big fan of the Little Cleo.
6740737,prov1800,2023-05-24 16:09:00,5010,The other day after I gave up on the rubbers I threw a flicker shad in same spots.This thing will go15 ft real fast but only reeled it down into about 5-8 ft and had pretty good luck with that.Last week I used it all day and had a heyday catching bass and walleyes on Cliff Lake.I will use a crank usually before rubbers at this time of the year.The crank bait can be used a while yet as walleyes will go deeper but at a slow rate
6740751,fishingMN4eyes,2023-05-24 20:04:00,108,"I think this is what I've struggled with when fishing plastics. I've never had much success and always been more confident with live bait. I don't know what the cadence should be, just don't have a good feel for it. I suppose it stands to reason that you need to jig it more aggressively than live bait, a little like you'd fish a jigging rap. Like you said, it's a reaction bite. August is long ways off but the more I watch Boley, Lindner, etc, I feel like I need to get in on this artificial movement when we get there lol."
6740773,Eckohlt,2023-05-25 04:30:00,3685,"Dont listen to those last 2 guys you mentioned,there promoting products.August is a great month for live bait."
6740829,Freytown,2023-05-25 07:28:00,770,I use Gulp at the Gouin as any live or dead fish bait is prohibited. I have good success with it but I am a firm believer that what you fish with the most will be your your best bait! FT
6740845,RichA$1970,2023-05-25 08:40:00,1158,"Hands down minnows are #1 follow by leeches & crawlers for me. However, there are no free minnows as they are baked into the rates or you spend a fortune on them along with having to keep them alive so that is why I do have plastics. I do agree on casting cranks & spoons as I enjoy it and it breaks up the jigging boredom at times."
6740879,emma17,2023-05-25 10:49:00,436,"A couple years back we were on a hot bite- running low on minnows so I brought out the paddle tails. I was missing the hook set and convinced myself the fish may have initially bit on the tail, but spit it/lost interest when they realized it wasn't live bait. So I figured I'd outsmart them and put a piece of old dead minnow at hook end. Well, this must have been an advanced school of fish as they figured me out quickly, and with expert carving skills managed to eat the portion of live bait while staying clear of the hook. They won the first round. God willing I'll be on them again in two days."
6744683,K2incog,2023-06-15 17:42:00,1,"Live/dead/frozen bait definitely has its place, it’s in the ocean, or on the end of a catfish rod. I completely understand its use in freshwater ponds, lake, streams and rivers, if you are trying to get children into fishing.We’ve only used artificial baits whereever we fish, and never have a problem landing plenty of fish. Often times outfishing the jigging walleye guys with rattletraps. There is no other feeling than having a fish hit your bait while you’re retrieving it."
6744687,Pooch,2023-06-15 18:02:00,4618,"This^^^ I love fishing fake bait, but I never go to Ontario without a few leeches or crawlers. There are times when it just takes some meat on the hook to make a sale, but not as much as most of us think. I keep a log of every trip and rereading it in the winter months passes the time. On several occasions I noted that I could not get a bite on leeches, worms or minnows, but started throwing plastic on a jig and started catching fish. It had to be just a reaction strike. Like our cat just can't pass up a moving string. It's just fishin'... whatever makes us happy, who cares.... Pooch"
6744747,Larry S,2023-06-16 07:09:00,665,Pooch On our trip to Okanse lake with Clark's June 2-10 the first day the weather was so hot that all the minnows provided by Clark's died. We went to plastics and caught over 800 fish We used these plastics either trolling or drift fishing when the wind blows the boat around Larry Schroeder
6744759,Mojo-NC,2023-06-16 08:24:00,1929,"Exactly! We had a similar situation where our minnows died and smelled so bad I couldn't use them any more. I switched to a Minnow-Z threaded on the hook on my jigs and nose-hooked a small paddletail on my spinner rigs. Both worked great and the best part is you don't have to reel up and check your bait when you swing and miss - it will still be there. For me the plastics were good for 20 fish or more each. For those who like to pull slow death rigs, Gulp Killer Crawlers work well."

6740539,Hunts1,2023-05-23 18:48:00,123,"Agree with this comment. Berkley Gulp are great. 3-4"" minnow. We generally will use live minnows until we find the fish and then put on the Gulp. But, probably do just about as well with the Gulp. Way less expensive and way more durable......."
6740545,prov1800,2023-05-23 18:58:00,5010,"Tried some gulp the other day,and a few other plastics.Bite just died using it compared to a walleye one after the other till i ran out of minnows.5 doz minnows gone in 2 hrs.60+ fish.Not going to that on plastic.especially when they were just tasting the minnow before sucking it in.they would of been drifting that plastic out.Have y buddies staying at Northern Lights on Cedar. Got into cabin fti so fished sat,sun,mon and and they have with the y of them caught 866 walleyes.Free bait at clarks camps they tried plastic to for the heck of itBite died back to free minnows as many as you need."

6740697,prov1800,2023-05-24 11:11:00,5010,Give us a report.
6740711,Old Timer,2023-05-24 12:23:00,255,Emma: I'm pretty sure you'll be switching over.
6740713,Pooch,2023-05-24 12:24:00,4618,"You can't fish plastic like you fish live bait. Live bait does the work (attracting and smell'n good) for us. When fishing plastic you have to make it look real and irresistible. Jigging plastic can be tough without some patience and willingness to try different movement or cadence. Gotta mimic how a real minnow behaves, usually they are struggling somewhat against the weight of the jig. Try different baits. Don't just throw up your hands and say plastic sucks. If you are going to drop an anchor, park over a spot and camp out there while drowning minnows then plastic probably will suck. Trolling plastic is a no brainer. It's mostly a reaction strike. Little chance of fish looking the bait over, it's either smack it or ignore it. I really enjoy live and fake bait. Depends on what is happening at the moment. Making plastic work is 95% about movement. Pooch"
6740715,prov1800,2023-05-24 12:43:00,5010,Understand Pooch.Tried different stuff.Had some hot bites going on minnows.Figured time to try some diff plastic I bring it with and it's always in my boat.Did catch a few made me feel good.lol.I agree you can catch fish and need more patience but most guys come up to catch lots of fish.Your just not going to that with artificial.plain and simple.Iam sure lots try and loose patience quickly.Each to his own personally I love life bait and I get it for free.The 6 guys at clarks on Cedar have now since yesterday evening caught over 1000 walleye.Thatsxa lot of bait you get included in your fishing pkg.Not sure what they caught today.Cold front this morning..They love that action for the week there here.couple tried artificial and just gave it up pretty quick..But if it's important to you to use the plastic all the power to you and good luck.
6740727,emma17,2023-05-24 15:11:00,436,"I wouldn't bet against you, but it won't be for lack of trying. I realize I have to be all-in to give it a fighting chance. I really hope it works as it makes life much simpler (I'd only have to bait my wife's hook). Last fall I gave the ol jigging rap a try, while three others in the boat used minnows. No doubt they caught more fish, however and unbelievably, I caught a magnificent Musky. I also caught the largest Walleye of the trip on the jigging rap. That said, I do enjoy the faster action of the live bait."
6740733,Larry S,2023-05-24 15:42:00,665,"Have tried Gulp over the years ,but never had much luck with them. Use Berkley Power Baits or Northland Impulse Paddletail Minnow in Electric Chicken or Charteuse Colors"

Where we've fished nobody catches 90 walleye. Not only that, but they want a lively minnow. When there's only dead ones left everything slows down. Obviously. Painfully. We've resorted to Gulp or PowerBait and caught... not many. We've proven this time and time again. I want to catch fish, not try everything in the tackle box.Why in the world would I wait all year for my trip and fish plastics out of some sense of macho bull**** then?Ever seen videos by Tom Boley? That guy catches walleye like I catch bluegills. I've seen him catch plenty on plastics, and even Acme Hyper Rattles. Yet sometimes the ""hot bite"" is slip bobber and leech. So he sticks with it. If it's good enough for a Pro it's good enough for me."

6738475,emma17,2023-05-12 09:57:00,436,I should have said better plastics fisherman. I do think/assume the techniques are different between live bait jigging and plastic jigging. I miss a lot of fish on plastic. I feel the bite but miss the hook set.
6738489,Eckohlt,2023-05-12 11:45:00,3685,"Don't give up,when there really going on plastic you won't miss many,but other times there just grabbing the tail,everybody misses fish your not the only one!"
6738507,stumcfar,2023-05-12 13:14:00,451,"I have my doubts when people say they catch as much or more on plastics than they do live bait. I wasn't with them so I shouldn't argue, but we often, try different types of plastics when on a crazy good walleye bite and I have never yet seen the catch rate anything close to what the live bait catches. When someone I am with proves me wrong, I will come back and post an apology. I don't think you will be seeing the apology. My two cents!"
6738509,kzoofisher,2023-05-12 13:18:00,5144,Absolutely true. And you can get into a school of small fish that can't quite get the hook in their mouths. Shifting from the wait for him to grab it hookset o the instantaneous takes a little practice too.
6738513,Eckohlt,2023-05-12 13:37:00,3685,"I like when there going on plastic,gives a guy a break from baiting up all the time."

6738537,Ricky Spanish,2023-05-12 14:07:00,1298,Last June we were catching walleye on a wind blown shallow weed line in Lost Bay on Eagle Lake. I was with my inexperienced nephew in law and catching 2-3x as many as him. It was 15min until lunchtime and I had upper forty something to his 17. I switched to a TRD finesse ned rig and proceeded to catch them even faster because I didn't have to rebait. We ended up with 90 before lunch. Figured I could attribute half of the numbers over him to my ability to put a minnow on a jig 5x faster than him. Switching to plastic just made it worse for him. Don't ask me why they eat that stupid looking ned rig but they sure did that day.
6738539,Eckohlt,2023-05-12 14:21:00,3685,"From time to time everyone gets there butt kicked in the boat,it hurtsssssssssss!"

6737403,LoDo,2023-05-07 13:40:00,721,"Ive always been partial to live or frozen bait and this year I'm bringing in some plastics. Not just a few, but a helluva lot of plastics. I was at Bass Pro for the 4th time in the last three weeks buying a bunch of crap I don't need and found myself in an entire section of plastics. Plastics have become crazy popular the last 10-15 yrs. Theres 5+ rows of plastics at Bass Pro. Easily 20+ companies/brands with plastics. Ive fished Canadian waters for 30 yrs and I don't recall plastic being that popular in the 90s or prior. Youtube has been unreal marketing for companies making tackle, bait and plastics. Im curious if a few of you use plastics or do continue with the live bait? Are you 50/50? A buddy of mine thats going on our trip this year has spent decades fishing Trout Lake NE of Red Lake and all he uses is plastic swim baits. I'm going to follow his lead. 26 days and counting!"

6737443,danvan18$,2023-05-07 16:38:00,67,"Interesting question. I have been going to Canada since 1985 and always used a combination of live bait (minnows/crawlers), salted minnows and gullets. About 10 years later we started going on fly-ins and mainly used twister tails with salted minnows and occasionally some crawlers. Then about 10-12 years ago we started using plastics like various gulp, ripple shads and twisters tails. You just don't need the live bait on the lakes we have visited as the fishing is just fantastic. It's less hassle to us to use the plastics and live bait will not improve the catch rate. It's more about what color do they want this year. We'll be flying in with PAC to Otatakan Lake in 26 days. Please be careful as several members of our group have developed PBS- Plastic Bait Syndrome. We just take way too much plastic now- LOL"
6737471,eyemike,2023-05-07 18:30:00,233,Lodo I fished Trout Lake. Awesome size and numbers for walleye! I used Pulse R paddle tails and Pulse R Moxies. Also did great trolling crankbaits. The only live bait that we used was using bottom bouncers pulling spinner/crawler rigs. Fantastic fishing!

I got tired of maintaining crawler ranches and the hassle of keeping them alive in the boat.

Two different lakes with which we are very familiar. One in mid June, the other in late July, early August. High rate of success. We mix in crawlers from Kakabeka Falls bait shop and some of the guys mix in leeches. We catch of ton of walleye, northern, small mouth. And, we ain't that darn good..."
6738329,emma17,2023-05-11 17:04:00,436,"I've wrestled with this issue for a long time. I believe the one thing holding me back from plastic is that I've always had live bait in the boat when I tried plastics. I will typically try plastics when we hit a hot spot, while the family continues with live bait. I start to get fidgety when I see them pull in fish while I miss. I imagine if I could just get myself to leave the dock with only plastic, I'd become a better fisherman. It's the security blanket of live bait that keeps me from going full bore."
6738337,Eckohlt,2023-05-11 17:47:00,3685,"Using plastic doesn't make you a better fisherman,just means your versatile to try diffrent baits."
6738365,kzoofisher,2023-05-11 19:39:00,5144,"I almost never use live bait, haven’t at all in three years. In Canada I doubt it matters much anytime the fishing is average; likely does on those occasions when weather has shut them down and you’re struggling to get any bites at all. I can tell you that on local inland lakes my experience is that plastics out fish bait. Not necessarily because it’s more ‘attractive’ to fish, because fishing plastic means moving spots and fishing fast until you find active fish and when you find them you pound them. Had this discussion on another board just after the opener. The guys pulling harnesses all struggled and continue to struggle. That’s purely on the nature of our inland fishery which is nothing like the Great Lakes. I’ve been throwing plastic, looking for active pods of fish and sitting on them. The bait guys are getting 2-3 fish when they don’t get skunked because they pick one up and troll away from the pod. I’m finding that pod and catching them all then moving on to the next, and I’m averaging a fish every 20 minutes or so per fisherman. Opening day my son and I were six hours from the time we splashed the boat until we pulled it out again: 29 walleye and I don’t know how many crappie, bass and pike. Fishing plastics is effective, easy and efficient. It takes a different mindset but once you have a Canada Lite day at home you’ll be sold."
6738467,Honkerslayer,2023-05-12 09:23:00,238,We havent use live bait of any kind on our trips for 6 years. We catch just as many fish with plastics as we did with live/dead bait.
