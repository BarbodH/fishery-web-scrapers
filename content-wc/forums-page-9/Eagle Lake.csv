Special thanks to Prov1800 as John pointed me in the right direction and he was spot on with his recommendations and a great help. Weather started off hot and was decent the rest of the week and only rained 2 times. Fishing was slow and it could have been me, but didn’t hit the numbers or size of fish. Did catch a 37” and 35” pike plus 2 40” muskies while not targeting them. Fish were mainly in 4-8’ and caught the bigger ones in 16’-20’. There were 4 of us and the other boat used minnows most of the time but never caught anything big, but I was not with them. We trolled cranks, jerks and casted spoons most of the time. If you wanted numbers, then 4’ in the weeds was the spot to be. John did tell me a bay to hit the far shoreline and luckily the chop was slapping the rocks and we pulled 33 off that little stretch in an hour or so off some Cotton Cordell’s Pros of the lodge1) boats were really good2) staff was nice along with the lodge3) we didn’t do the American plan but the food looked good & they gave us some fresh baked bread and she baked us an apple pie- owners wife was really kind. 4) checkout was really good compared to other places I’ve been as:a) you get 6 gallons of gas a day & what you don’t use they credit it off your bill. We only burned 20g all week so they took $110 of our billb) for the 13% tax, they credited us 6% back for I think it’s the GST that they filled out the tax form for us and took it off our billc) these 2 items totaled around $175 per personConsa) if you are driving a car up there, the last 3 miles would be tough unless they run the motor grade on itb) the cabins are rough and small, 4 people in the 2 b/r cabin was really tight quarters. There was maybe 10” between the beds. c) shower in the cabin I could have pissed harder than the water that sprinkled outd) it’s hilly and when it rained it was slickGlad I went but probably won’t return as Eagle is a big lake (never felt crowded by all the boats you see flying by) with a lot of lodges. I prefer the only lodge / camp on a lake for me but I know many have success on Eagle so not bashing it as there’s big fish in there, just not for me. Border was no problem both ways and we had a guy just with a DL & birth certificate."

6743851,JAY221,2023-06-11 16:51:00,877,"Rich, I thank you for taking the time to report back on your trip. It means a lot to some of us. Later, Jay"
6743925,HeHooksHimself,2023-06-12 07:02:00,725,"Thanks Rich. Sounds like reasons we usually avoid a lake like Eagle. But, as you know, we also booked SSL for our August trip. I know John pointed you so some spots but did the camp owners offer any information? As you know, we jig a lot so I assume we will have a lot more walleye action but who can fish Eagle without a Muskie hunt or two? I got a chuckle out of your comment on the shower, but the older you get, the more the flow comparison is a weak analogy, ha ha. If you have any other info specifically for us feel free to DM me. Otherwise, look for our review of South Shore Lodge in late August. Until then... Fish On! Hooks"
6743931,prov1800,2023-06-12 07:18:00,5010,Glad I could help out a bit.Eagle is definitely a beautifull body of water.Your location was in a spot that has a lot of traffic coming from up north in the Vermilion Bay area and lots of fisherman target the Nash Bay area.Further east where I was guiding out of North Shore lodge is never as busy as that and my week there was very calm.We saw boats but all from far distance.I fished a couple of bays south of camp farthest a half hour and saw no one.Our fishing was spectacular as we had 100 walleye days every morning of fishing and then fished different areas in afternoons for pike and smallmouth.If you ever decide to come back to Eagle Lake I would suggest that east end.Be a totally different experience.Had a group with younger boys last 4 days and that's always fun.
6743957,emma17,2023-06-12 09:40:00,436,"Prov- as the East end appears to be shallower, is it a better late spring/early summer area? Or is it good year round?"
6744029,Old Timer,2023-06-12 15:07:00,255,Rich: Thank you for your thorough report. I've heard from others that Eagle has a steep learning curve for DIY fishermen. Perhaps you did as well as could have been expected without using a guide.
