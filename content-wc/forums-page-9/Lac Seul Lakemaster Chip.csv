6743089,StPaulWalleye,2023-06-07 15:07:00,1,"We all know the French translation of Lac Seul is: ""Lower unit wrecker"".... Been going there for 25 years (Ear Falls side), know the lake well. First 15 years just used a paper map and the help of Mr Beardsley. Now with fancy depth finders and Ipads/phones I do have Navionics running just as a reference. Not always 100% accurate (like going past Sand Island down to Steamboat) and depths change, but it seems to have 90% of the underwater landmines. Obviously the lake levels change +-/6-8ft depending on the year and time of year. I was going to switch to Humminbirds, and wondering if anyone runs Lakemaster on Lac Seul? Thoughts? I have no complaints on the Navonics."
6743133,lunker99,2023-06-07 20:08:00,236,Can't help you (yet). Picked up the Lakemaster Ontario chip last year and going to get to try it in a couple weeks in the Ear Falls area. Loaded it up for the first time last weekend briefly and looks like it has decent countour markings for the lake but didn't spend enough time to see how accurate it is for the places I'm familiar with. Don't know if Lac Seul has been formally mapped and guessing a lot of the contours are assumed and will be missing a few of the humps similar to the Navionics chip.
6743175,Lmbkiller,2023-06-08 06:26:00,639,Havnt seen for myself but heard it's basically the same as navionics chip for lac seul
6743191,JDP,2023-06-08 07:54:00,1457,"I have a Lakemaster Ontario V2 map chip (pic attached).I used it last year fishing out of Mahkwa Lodge within 20 miles of the Lodge.So, I have not looked at the mapping for the Ear Falls to McKenzie Bay area.My opinion:I found the map to be very similar to the Navionics map.Contours, islands, etc. seemed to be the same.There certainly are no 3-foot, 1-foot contours.There are features such as lake level offset and contour shading/coloringthat can be played with. However, I don't know how accurate these features arebased upon the mapping of the chip.I am not saying do not buy the Lakemaster Chip. But, it will not be the help on Lac Seul as it is on a lake that ihas been mapped by the Lakemaster crew."
6743751,Carnhzkr,2023-06-11 07:13:00,964,"I have both. I typically put the Navionics at the console and LM at the bow. The maps and depth are the same. The one thing I have noticed, though, the Navionics map actually has the navigation buoys and the route shown on the map. This is especially useful if you're on the eastern side of the lake and heading north, toward Taylor Island. On the way to Taylor, you want to keep right of red, but at Taylor, it changes to left of red. This makes it much easier to navigate in that area. The LM map doesn't have that. At least mine doesn't."
6744095,Slim03,2023-06-12 19:24:00,159,Going north itâ€™s red on the left and green on the right. It switches between Taylor and Bear Narrows and before you enter the Narrows you want the red on the right because if it is on the left your lower unit is probably gone.
6744125,pjshorthorn,2023-06-13 04:29:00,5654,"Technically, both of you and Carnhzr are correct. Your posts are just worded differently. One difference is that you state that the navigational bouys change between Taylor Island and Bear Narrows. The change happens at Taylor Island as that is where the current change is and the channels change. Dewy Narrows is your change point. From there , I go to the right of Taylor Island and pick up the nav bouys past Taylor. I've been navigating this part of Lac Seul for 40 years so how I do it is not a recommendation without having the experience. Just follow the nav bouys as outlined on the chips. Last year I used a paper map like always, next to us my buddy had his portatable locater. My paper route and his locater were dead nuts on between the old school method and new school method. The paper map was surveyed about 1969 by the MNR. One day I'll frame that section of the map. She has taught me well over the years. It takes me from Sioux Lookout to Bear Narrows. From there it is an easy shot to SkiDoo Point and I'm Home for the week. PjShorthorn"
