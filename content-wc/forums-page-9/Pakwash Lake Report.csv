The weather was really up and down. Very hot to start. We found good action in a couple areas on the West side of the Lake near the mouth of the river. As the weather cooled and rain set in, we moved our fishing to Cabin Bay and caught tons of big walleyes and several nice northerns. Used leaches, nightcrawlers, and minnows with success. Mainly trolling with jigs or spinners. We only keep walleyes under 18"" and had a heck of a time catching our limits of fish that were that small. Caught and released tons of fish between 18"" and 23"". Best was a 30"" and two 28"". The beach was decent early in the week, but shut down as weather cooled. Bruce Lake has always been good to us, but was terrible fishing while we were there. Tried it twice and did not catch much of anything."
6743789,Eckohlt,2023-06-11 10:33:00,3685,Any smallies around cabin bay??
6743815,That Minnesota guy,2023-06-11 12:16:00,8293,Nice report. Glad you had fun.
6743861,Franco,2023-06-11 17:59:00,107,"Bill is a great guy and his camps look really nice. We didnâ€™t stay there but visited, talked to him for a long time, and rented one of his boats (long story). Actually we wish we had stayed there."
6743929,Nimitz,2023-06-12 07:13:00,20,"I have never caught a smallie in Cabin Bay or seen one caught. We don't fish for smallies, but I have caught some around the big island as you enter Bruce Lake. I caught a nice one there this year trolling for walleyes. Onn the east side of the river before you enter Pakwash, there is a small creek or marsh that enters the river there. I have seen guys actively fish that area for smallies in the past and have caught a few trolling for walleyes in that location."
6743949,Web,2023-06-12 08:14:00,7,"We were up at Pakwash last week as well and would echo many of your comments.. Overall, i would say that the fishing was truly great.. Really had great flurries of action every day.. Super hot, rain and wind, bugs biting, none of it mattered to these fish.. Fish were hitting and hitting hard.. while we didnt make it into cabin bay this year, we did hit up almost everywhere else and just had a blast. For walleyes, i agree.. we had so many fish between 20-25"" it was crazy.. much more difficult to catch a 17-18"" fish than it was to catch an over 20"".. Nice problem to have.. And we absolutely killed it on the big Pike.. 5 fish over 40"".. Lots of 36-40"" and some real tanks in the bunch.. The fish at Pakwash are in nice shape and my only true thoughts right now are how can i wait until next spring to get back up.. Web"

6744195,Habitual Eyer,2023-06-13 13:48:00,144,Pakwash looks like one to try in the future. Always looked down at Trout River resort from up on 105 as we head up to Red Lake. Anyone know if Trout Lake has full RV hookups ?...Pretty sure they have electric/water but need septic as well. Very reasonable cabin rates but looks like they may not have smaller cabins for just two people ?? Any info would be appreceated !!
