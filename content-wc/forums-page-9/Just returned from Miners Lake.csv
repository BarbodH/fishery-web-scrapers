One thunderstorm rolled through Sunday afternoon and cut our day short. We were able to catch our evening fish fry fish off the dock after the rain finally quit. We had a first, as our pilot hit a marked rocked as we taxied out Saturday morning and got the plane hung up. He eventually got us off the rock, but back to the dock to discover a pretty good crack in a pontoon and it was filling with water. He got it pumped out and we did take off. It made for a bit nervous fight and a very quick departing of guys and gear at the dock, so he could take off before it filled up too much. The fishing was as good as I have had on any trip. Because of of a partial day Saturday and getting chased off the lake Sunday, we had about 3.5 days of fishing, with a midday breaks for food and a nap. 5 guys boated 760 walleyes. I have heard of blue walleyes before, but have never seen anything like most of these fish. The cleaning table would literally be blue in spots after cleaning. I am attempting to tag a picture of one here so you can see what I am talking about. Overall, great trip, with a nice cabin. Looking forward to next year.https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...1&d=1686241279"

6743247,stumcfar,2023-06-08 12:14:00,451,"Nope, Troy and Penny Sawyer have had it for several years I believe. The bad thing for the pilot is the rock was marked with a jug and he had been in an out several times before."
6743251,kona77,2023-06-08 12:49:00,236,We have only seen/caught blue walleyes on two lakes over the years. They really are neat looking fish. Waiting for a picture from a buddy on a Northern we caught and I will post. Hard to describe it with words but something we have never seen before.
6743523,Ohio fisherman,2023-06-09 22:37:00,988,Nice report. Too bad on the rock incident. That will be an expensive pilot error. Beautiful blue walleye! Different flavor?
6743547,Eckohlt,2023-06-10 04:40:00,3685,Slap some gorilla tape on that pontoon and away we go.
6744595,stumcfar,2023-06-15 09:11:00,451,The fish tasted the same and we haven't grown any extra body parts or anything since eating them! The same pilot picked us up and he said some aluminum and some rivets and he was good to go.
6744597,a_hershy,2023-06-15 09:21:00,36,We're they all blue with varying degrees of how much or were some of them more 'normal' colored?
