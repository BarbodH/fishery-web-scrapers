6744397,Wallychowder,2023-06-14 12:01:00,1567,$45 a month ? Or $45 a week ? Kind of misleading !
6744431,Huntindave,2023-06-14 13:54:00,2194,Not at all misleading. Their ad says $45 per month. The user is only going to use it for roughly 7 days. His cost is $45 for his week of usage. What part of that do you not understand?.
6744451,Wallychowder,2023-06-14 15:00:00,1567,Roughly ? What is Roughly ? He said 7 days which calculates to $ 11.25 a week ! Understand ? I didn't think so.....lol.
6744469,Huntindave,2023-06-14 17:33:00,2194,What part of $45 dollars do you NOT understand?Just because he is only using a partial month does not reduce the minimum available block of time offered by the storage company. Sheesh Did you see a weekly rate in their ad?
6744531,kzoofisher,2023-06-15 03:25:00,5144,"To get the full value of the parking rate he should stay with his brother-in-law for an additional three weeks after the Canada trip and pick up the vehicle at the end of the months rental. Should also check if the rental fee is in USD or CAD or RUB, can make a huge difference!"
6744555,v-bay gord,2023-06-15 05:42:00,3168,"Better yet, maximize the parking value by spending a month in Canada fishing!"

6744193,a_hershy,2023-06-13 13:44:00,36,"Learned a lot reading WC posts. So, thought I would look for some experience/expertise here on a pretty random Canada trip question.My brother-inlaw will be joining me on the trip to Lac Seul in July. He lives in eastern Iowa; I'm in eastern Nebraska. Clear Lake is the spot our path first cross. So I'm looking for suggestions on where we might park a car for the week as he jumps in with me.I know - odd question, but if you have a suggestion please message me. Thankshershy"

However, the overnight parking policies are left to the discretion of the local store managers - so if you think you might what to try that, you'd need to call the nearest Walmart, probably Mason City. You of course would have to decide whether you are comfortable with the security of leaving your car there for any period of time - it's not the store's concern. Cheers."
6744219,Wallychowder,2023-06-13 16:01:00,1567,Park it at a Hy-vee in Mason city and make sure there's insurance on it !

6744373,NWBearcatgrad,2023-06-14 10:04:00,36,"In the past we have parked vehicles at the airport at Mason City. It is free, and we never had any issues. I am not sure, but think they have a ""security"" person who drives the lots. It's just off I-35 so easy on and off access. The storage place mentioned above is a good deal for $45 though, and no need to worry about security or other issues. Good luck!"
6744391,a_hershy,2023-06-14 11:29:00,36,Agreed.Knew I came to the right spot.
