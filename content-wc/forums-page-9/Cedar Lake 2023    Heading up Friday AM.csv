In fact, i don't want to go somewhere I am not that excited about. Prov1800.....thanks for all the pics and updates. Really helps fuel the fire while working and daydreaming. Just saw you post about the mayfly hatch. Hopefully that doesn't throw off next week much.....fingers crossed. Crossing Friday night and sleeping in Fort Frances any idea what that border wait is typically like post covid anyone? 2 more sleeps. Can not wait! Fish tacos and and a chance for a 50 inch monster."

6744575,Web,2023-06-15 07:10:00,7,We were thru last Friday at like 2-3pm.. line up was just around the corner and it took us about 30-40 min. No big deal. It took us almost as long at duty free as it did crossing the border..
6744591,wmd,2023-06-15 08:56:00,388,Put the CBSACanBorder app on your phone they update wait times hourly or so. It gives you an idea of wait times. wmd
