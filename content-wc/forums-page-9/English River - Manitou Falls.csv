Our group of 6 fished for 5 days. We caught a bunch of walleyes, 137 >20"", largest was 27.75 inches. We also caught several northerns >30"", largest being 39"". If you are heading that way, don't forget the mosquito repellent! Dan M"

6744237,Eckohlt,2023-06-13 18:56:00,3685,"If your trying to find lures that won't work,soak them in gasoline,you'll probably hit the jack pot of non working lures."
