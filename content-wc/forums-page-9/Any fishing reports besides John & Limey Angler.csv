Originally it was the 28 of june through the 11 aug but Tom had a chance to rent the cabin for a month so we moved ahead a week. We will leave plenty for you! My understanding is it is down quite a bit. I will know more in a few weeks. I'll let you know. It can't be any lower than a couple of years ago or it won't be a lake. Later, Jay"
6742015,MJD_2,2023-06-01 04:18:00,5,My family and I are staying at Evergreen Lodge on Eagle Lake from June 3rd - 10th. I’ll post an update here when we return. I’ve also heard the water is low.
6744063,MJD_2,2023-06-12 17:26:00,5,"Eagle Lake , Ont. Fishing Update. We fished from June 3rd - 10th. The fishing was excellent! Couldn’t keep the walleyes off our lines. Caught lots of eaters, slots and one over the slot. Killed them on original floating Rapalas in perch and fire tiger size #13. Chatter baits and dare devils for pike / Muskie. Caught everything shallow. Frog head, lost bay, rice, bay, camp six and three sisters were all productive. I don’t think I’ve had better fishing there and this was my 8th time at Eagle."
