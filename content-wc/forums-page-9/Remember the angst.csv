6743923,Larry S,2023-06-12 06:58:00,665,RIGHT!! Going back to USA on Sat June 10th about 230PM at Ft Frances the Cars & Trucks were Backed UP for about 2 miles to enter Canada. Was a Big Surprise as I thought the Traffic might be jammed up going back to USA. Larry Schroeder
6742441,That Minnesota guy,2023-06-03 18:42:00,8293,"Remember all the complaining about Canada and lodge / resort owners. The complaints about refunds on deposits, time limits to use them ect. Today (Sat. June 3rd) the traffic was backed up 150 yards around the corner getting to the I-Falls toll bridge at noon. Seems alot of guys who had very strong opinions swallowed their keyboard bravado and are taking trips again. Traffic North & South on Hwy 53 by I-Falls was very heavy. Hope the lodge / resorts guys have record summers."

6742523,fishron,2023-06-04 12:01:00,317,"Two Septembers back our group of three cars, two towing boats went through at the Thousand Islands. We were the only vehicles going through, mid day, Saturday at a crossing that has at least eight entry booths. In over fifty times through I never saw anything like it. In two weeks we go through again. I think we'll have more company this time."
