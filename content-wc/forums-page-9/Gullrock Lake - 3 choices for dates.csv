6727309,RichA$1970,2023-03-28 09:14:00,1158,There’s at least 6 resorts on the chain so just an estimate but that’s around 50 cabins so I’d expect at least 50 boats (if just 1 boat for each cabin but could be more) not including any local traffic.
6727311,Danneemac1,2023-03-28 09:20:00,7,"Thanks. We've done that too. I should add, we're trying to keep costs down this year due to a big trip (not fishing) we took already this year. We are RVing for this trip and have a relatively low cost plan for this particular trip, so not looking for a fly in. Thanks though."
6727315,prov1800,2023-03-28 09:34:00,5010,Good way to look at it Rich but you know there's at least more than 2 people to a cabin.Doubling your count would be more realistic if not more.
6727321,prov1800,2023-03-28 09:44:00,5010,"Check out Cliff Lake Rv Park.Beautifull crystal clear waters.Has all species.Beautifull walleyes,bit hard to catch them but if your a fairly good fisherman well worth the effort.Lake trout,tons of easy bass,lots of muskies and decent pike.Not a lot of traffic one camp and not busy.Worth a look."
6727343,johnboat,2023-03-28 10:51:00,2014,"SMH.....everybody always tries to change people's minds.He's chosen Gullrock, and asked about times.My answer is, definitely June.Bumper boats!? Really? It's 12 miles long and 16,707 acres. If there are 200 boats, I'd hardly call that bumper boats.Ever been to lock and dam #9 or #10 on the Mississippi when the Walleyes are going nuts? THAT'S bumper boats.If you want to be the only boat on a lake, there are 3 options. Buy your own lake, fly in to a single cabin lake (not sure the fishing will be as good as on Gullrock), or go to a lake where the fish aren't biting.Generally speaking, if there do happen to be a handful of boats in a spot, it means the fish are biting in that area.Will there be a group of boats every now and then on Gullrock? Possibly, but it's been my experience it's during the night bite, everybody is just enjoying the evening, catching fish, and I have yet to see any pizzing matches. And that's after 20+ years.If the OP would like some real life info or advise on Gullrock, PM me. You won't be the first guy I've mailed a map to of that lake with some good specific spots on it.Enjoy your search, that's half the fun!"
6732379,Danneemac1,2023-04-16 17:35:00,7,"Well... last week in June it is! It's all set! I really want to thank everyone for all of their input. It sounds like the lake is pretty good anytime of year and am really looking forward to checking it out! I'll actually be renting a boat from a resort. Apparently it will have a brand new Humminbird on it. I'd love to get my hands on an a detailed ""paper"" map though so I can continue to pester you guys for location advice, etc. Any location, technique, or any other advice anyone has to give, I'll take it! Again, thank you much and we'll be in touch!"
6732385,Eckohlt,2023-04-16 17:44:00,3685,"If your going to gull rock,just look for all the boats that's where the fish are!"
6732387,Walleye2242,2023-04-16 17:49:00,263,I sent you a DM awhile back.
6732649,PhilTickelson,2023-04-17 13:33:00,84,"Who'd you book with? Most resorts will give you a paper map when you get there, and in the mean time there's a decent map on Wright's homepage: http://www.wrightswildernesscamp.com/ I just got back from an ice fishing trip on GullRock, you'll love the lake, it's one of the best drive-to destinations in Ontario in my opinion. Johnboat helped me out a ton before my first trip, he's a great resource and a wealth of information on that lake. I'd be happy to help as well, but in a lot of cases your best bit of intel is going to come from your lodge owner. Although I know some are definitely better than others in that regard!"
6744045,johnboat,2023-06-12 15:30:00,2014,"Danneemac1,Have you checked your PM's lately?"
6726691,7 Mag,2023-03-25 17:05:00,1887,"Good choice, enjoy!"
6726823,Mondo,2023-03-26 13:22:00,61,"The last week in August is a busy week on the water as the Red Lake Fall Classic is held on Sept 2-3. There are many tournament fisherman prefishing the week prior in Gullrock and Red Lake. Thought you should be aware of the increased pressure that occurs during that week. Frankly, I've fished all of those weeks, plus the tournament. Any of the weeks listed are good weeks for fishing. I've tried to anticipate mayfly hatches and it happens sporadically throughout the summer. You will catch fish and have a great time. I just wanted you to be aware of the last week of August and what that entails. Mondo"
6727085,Danneemac1,2023-03-27 11:33:00,7,Ugghh! Anyone else want to comment on Mondo's last post? Thanks!
6727143,Eckohlt,2023-03-27 14:10:00,3685,"All depends on if your ok with seeing a crap load of boats,for me I don't like to see any."
6727147,prov1800,2023-03-27 14:26:00,5010,Big lake.Lots of spots to hide.Head north.everyone else goes south.Thats the trick.lol.
6727159,prov1800,2023-03-27 14:54:00,5010,He's right
6727191,RichA$1970,2023-03-27 17:56:00,1158,". That’s a great thing about this forum, getting information like this as I’d wait until mid September to avoid the bumper boats."
6727201,johnboat,2023-03-27 18:56:00,2014,"I've been to Gull Rock 20+ years in a row. If you can book a week in June on that lake, I'd jump on it.Done deal."
6727305,Danneemac1,2023-03-28 08:57:00,7,"Okay, July is now out (no longer an option for us), but now still entertaining the last week in June... The idea of ""bumper boats"" the last week of August before the tournament does not appeal to me. Have been on Kabetogama, LOTW Canada several times, Eagle Lake Ont. last year where we primarily fished portage lakes (often didn't see any other boats all day). In all of these trips, we were usually fishing spots by ourselves or maybe another boat would show up on occasion. Point being, I also do not care for ""crowded"" fishing. For last week in June possibility: I've learned from these posts not to be too concerned about a Mayfly hatch impacting the bite. I'm not overly concerned about ""bugs"", being from Minnesota and having been on many fishing and camping trips in the past, they're usually not that bad during the day, unless there are swarms of biting horseflies (don't care for those... especially the wife... who does)? It seems like the bite would likely be very good late June and could fish shallower, which would be good since we are renting a boat. Question: How does crowdedness/number of boats compare last week in June to the last week in August, the week preceding the Red Lake Fall Classic tournament? Thanks very much!!!"
6727307,prov1800,2023-03-28 09:11:00,5010,You sound like the kinda people that would enjoy a peacefull and great fishing fly out.Would fill your needs.
6726367,7 Mag,2023-03-24 10:23:00,1887,"Thanks John, last August i found a few spots that were away from the other boats. A couple of days i could hear boats off in the distance but couldn't see them, it was great!!"
6726413,Eckohlt,2023-03-24 13:09:00,3685,"Im going aug 13 if it snows then,my wife is going to rap me along side my head with a oar!!"
6726555,RESJR,2023-03-25 08:33:00,7,I've been fishing Nungesser Lake the last week of June for about 10 years now. Nungesser drains into Gull Rock so I think the timing of cycles would be pretty similar. We have had one or two days where we hit the mayfly hatch but I've never felt that it really messed up the walleye bite. Most years the mayfly hatch happens after we have headed home (so first week or two of July). We like the last week of June as the fish are usually still shallow and it is not too hot.
6726561,dlp8940,2023-03-25 08:48:00,6,My wife and I fished Gullrock for the first time in 2019. Right in the hatch. We caught lots of fish and didn't even know the lake.
6726569,Eckohlt,2023-03-25 09:01:00,3685,Goes to show it's not rocket science to catch fish in ONT!.
6726599,Walleye2242,2023-03-25 10:52:00,263,"This statement....I have fished ontario since 1979. Biggest walleye is a 28. about 20 years ago i brought up 2 buddies that never fished canada.....they wanted to fish together, which i thought was a mistake, in 2 hours they caught a 29, 30, and a 27 walleye. 2 of them are on my buddies wall. They put on a little joe and a worm in 20 feet of water in a back bay. Go figure!!!!!"
6726601,Eckohlt,2023-03-25 11:05:00,3685,Is the lake a secret??they still go with you?
6726637,Walleye2242,2023-03-25 12:50:00,263,Nope...no secrets...Clark's on edward lake back in like 1998ish? went there for like 3 years. They do not go anymore. The dad got a DUI in like 1990 which was not worries and then got another in like 2006 and that was the end of it as he doesnt want to hassle with it..so him and his son go to north minny area.
6726643,Eckohlt,2023-03-25 13:04:00,3685,Happy to hear your still going.
6726689,Danneemac1,2023-03-25 16:55:00,7,"Hey all, this is some great information! Thank you so much!! I am leaning heavily toward last week in August. Just need to work out a few more details. Once booked, I’ll be online again looking for details on spots, presentation, etc.Again, thanks so much! You guys are great!"
6726177,RichA$1970,2023-03-23 18:07:00,1158,I’d go June and avoid August as I hit severalHeat waves 100 miles north of Red Lake which wasn’t fun. I’ll take the cold any day.
6726181,prov1800,2023-03-23 18:28:00,5010,You don't like heat Rich.i can't wait for that heat to come.Thats the nice part of being in a boat and close to water to cool off.Bring the heat.
6726187,7 Mag,2023-03-23 18:45:00,1887,"No can do, I meant I'll be in NWO the last week of August, I'll be on Eagle catching lots of fish!"
6726203,SweetD,2023-03-23 19:11:00,243,Last week of August. Late June = BUGSJuly = HEATI fell for the mid July thing last year (last time). Was hotter than h_e_ll!!!! I know it can happen any time but we had near 100 degree temps for 3-4 days and while we caught plenty of fish it was brutal hot. Now I’m a fun and chunky middle aged dude that has been on 30+ trips to the bush and will always take a hoodie over a man thong that has to be wrung out each night. Good luck and enjoy! Gullrock is a solid fishery!!!!!
6726209,Eckohlt,2023-03-23 19:25:00,3685,"Been up there in mid July with the long undies on,ya never know about that Ontario weather,anytime of the year!!but I'm with you SweetD love to have a sweatshirt on!"
6726291,bthomas3333,2023-03-24 07:21:00,465,July is a really tricky month for remote trips. Im with Eck. I'd rather layer up than burn. When I am looking at trips in July I try to stay as far North as possible. There are some areas i just steer clear unless I can see the weather on the 10 day and jump last minute. B-
6726303,prov1800,2023-03-24 07:48:00,5010,End of Aug is usually some great fishing on Eagle and still have great weather.Youll be very close to some very good structure that can produce a lot of action.Popular spots so could have boats on them but plenty within your area.
6726333,valley366,2023-03-24 08:56:00,193,"Have done 2 trips in late August. 2 years ago we came back labor day weekend. Last year moved it to a week earlier. Caught plenty of eyes both trips. Weather was about the same both trips. Nice thing is like everyone says is a bit cooler.Never been there in July. Normally we are second week of June. In fact last year the kid and I started doing 2 trips a summer. One in mid June and one late August. One thing about June is you get quite a bit more evening fishing in. Amazing how much later the sun goes down in June compared to August. Might be a factor depending on your style. I prefer to be in a boat until 9pm so like the June option.Fishing is about the same, just in different spots. We fish jig and minnow both trips with success.Good Luck."
6726339,guidedfishing,2023-03-24 09:20:00,531,"All the dates are great, I always had fished May, June, July, and September in Ontario. It wasn't until I was forced out of September due to some family commitments and tried August that if found out what I was missing.I can tell you August is now my favorite time, Typically bugs have run their course, not that there is a lot of fishing pressure to begin with but it has certainly let up from the typical June crazy time. Weather is typically great, and best of all walleye are usually in a solid summer pattern bunched up and fight like smallmouth on crack.If I can help it, I won't miss the August bite. One of the best months, next to September.I almost always seem to get snowed on in May, June & September. Never been snowed on yet knock on wood in August.good luck."
6726363,7 Mag,2023-03-24 10:17:00,1887,Us August fishermen need to start promoting June & July!!
6725981,Danneemac1,2023-03-23 10:44:00,7,"Hello - I'm requesting advice please from those of you who know Gullrock Lake well. My wife and I are planning a trip to Gullrock Lake this year (in an RV). We have never been near this far north in Ontario. We have 3 different weeks we can take off of work: --- 1.) Last week in June --- 2.) 2nd week in July --- 3.) Last week in August. --- While I know the 2nd week in July would give us the warmest weather for other activities, our big concern is the best fishing. I am also concerned about a Mayfly hatch. I have read other strings and some comments indicating that late August would typically be good fishing. We primarily fish walleye but also northern. Thank you for any help you can provide!"
6726001,Pezman38,2023-03-23 11:11:00,3196,"The fishing on Gull Rock is normally pretty good so I wouldn't worry about picking a good fishing time. With a good graph you will find fish, and the best part about gullrock is you can fish the leeward sides of islands and normally slay em. I hope to get back there someday but went there for a solid 10 years before the 20+ hr drive got me looking elsewhere."
6726007,Thunder man,2023-03-23 11:17:00,27,"All these dates will provide great fishing!June will find them shallower , while July/ will have them going onto mid lake reefs, structure etc, same as late August.July weather will be the best, but as far as catching goes, that’s the least of your worries.Enjoy your trip!"
6726071,Walleye2242,2023-03-23 13:50:00,263,Where are you staying? I have fished gullrock in all months. fishing is great on gullrock and you will catch alot of walleye anytime of the year. Sept. is my favorite but that my opinion. June will be great...july will be good and last august will be good. I fished late august and late sept. last year on gullrock....caught plenty of fish but caught more in late sept. You will be happy by going further north. it is worth the drive.
6726081,7 Mag,2023-03-23 14:22:00,1887,"The last week of August would be my choice, good weather & not a lot of bugs."

6726147,Danneemac1,2023-03-23 16:53:00,7,Thank you everyone! Anyone else? So I shouldn't be concerned about a Mayfly hatch in June or July shutting everything down for 2 or 3 days? Thanks.
6726163,Eckohlt,2023-03-23 17:27:00,3685,"They don't shut down,I've slayed'em during the hatch,feeding frenzy."
