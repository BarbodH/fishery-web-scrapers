526890,Guest,2003-01-26 15:23:00,0,Not a bad place to live either.....Imagine having Lac Seul or Rainy Lake in your backyard everyday of your life....My Yankee brothers...you should seriously consider moving up north and see what your missing.
526891,River Rat,2003-01-26 15:41:00,43,I'll have to pass up on the invitation. I won't give up my guns.
526892,McQ,2003-01-26 17:15:00,615,"Would love to have more of you visit us here in Quebec, we've got everything from great river fishing to some of the largest walleye infested reservoirs in the country. You haven't been walleye fishing until you spend a few days on the Gouin Reservoir which is completely detail mapped - all of it's 13,000 miles of shoreline is available to fish and I gotta tell you or maybe warn is a better word the Northerns up here are giants."

526895,TeeDub,2003-01-27 10:09:00,48,She DO look good don't she! The best tight end on the field by far!
526893,T Bone,2003-01-27 12:03:00,18,"Have been to Lake Kipawa, QC the last three years and love it. Great fishing, beautiful scenery, and nice hospitality. Fished all over in Ontario for over 20 years until 1999 and already prefer Quebec. And given the proper opportunity, I'd consider moving to Canada."
526896,nemio,2003-01-28 16:59:00,96,"Oh Yeah! On a sandy beach at the Gouin, plenty of walleyes, big Pikes & Shania getting a sun tan (no she is not washing dishes). Excuse-me I just waiking up. Everything is true except for Shania; by the way I was listening an interview on a Can. channel and YES she like fishing."

526898,Guest,2003-02-06 15:00:00,0,I would be happy to bring Shania along on our Fly-in this August. I'll even share my portion of the Blue. I'll even go as far to let her sleep in my room. If time allows we'll catch some walleye. It DOESN'T get any better then that!Bigfish
