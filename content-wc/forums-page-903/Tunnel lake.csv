527304,Guest,2003-02-05 13:18:00,0,Have been to Tunnel but have graduated to the far north not thinking Tunnel is even in Ontario if you know what I mean. If you want to see what is over the next hill so to speak you need to get into the bush where few dare to tread--you can drive a lincoln or a caddy to tunnel for me to be fishing I have to at least go the last 5-15 miles on a quad just me speaking here.
527305,Rich B,2003-02-05 17:09:00,1081,"I've been up to Camp Kuha on Tunnel Lake the last three years andhad a good time every trip (although the fishing last year wasn't thebest as the daily temps were around 100, and the mayflies hatched).As the other post noted, Tunnel Lake is just into Ontario (1 1/2 hrsfrom the Soo), but from where I'm driving (East Central Ohio), it'sa decent one day drive. The lake itself has fairly good smallmouth, pike and walleye fishing. No, it's not a Lake of the Woods, Eagle, or Lac Suel; but for me I'm not driving two days each way on my week's vacation. We always get enough fish for several fish frys, some fish to take home for the family and it's a pretty lake. It does have a handful of cottages at the east (?) end, and a small campground (15 or so spots that locals normally use on weekends). As far as Camp Kuha goes, the owners are great, and it's an almostnew camp. No, you're not going to get 100 walleye days but you shouldget enough for shore lunch/evening fish frys, etc. and it's a fairlysafe lake to run in your own boat, if you wish to trailer one up.Email me if you want more info.....I've taken a number of my friendsthat love to fish up with me the last two years, and we've got a groupgoing back this year."
