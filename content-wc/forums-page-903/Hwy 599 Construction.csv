526331,lenray,2003-01-08 10:30:00,467,Hello FishoilWhere do you fish up there we were up past Pickle last May on the Pipestone a lot of snow on May 25th. have a pic snow to my knees just about to my knees.Fishing up that way is BEYOND telling most would think I was a lying fisherman if it were told.
526333,Behle,2003-01-08 10:43:00,51,Our group was in for a fly-in at Rusty Myers which is just south of Savant Lake. We were there the third week of June and we did not see any construction. If there is any work to be done there isn't much you can do since that's our only route there.
526332,Fishoil,2003-01-08 11:24:00,1277,"We fish at Lake Pashkogogan. You go right past it on your way up, it's about 30 miles south of Pickle. We drove home on May 25th last year, but we got the snowstorm a couple days before. We had to bust ice and fish in snow most of the week. You're right about the fishing up there, it's great. Someday I'd like to get up to Pipestone for a week too."

526335,Guest,2003-01-08 20:44:00,0,"I have been going to the Savant Lake area for several years, I think that road stays in a constant state of construction, stretches of gravel, then stretches of pavement. It's always being worked on, kind of like 502 . There are some logging roads around Savant Lake area that can get you to fly in quality fishing. Have stayed at White Sands Camp, located on the north arm of Sturgeon Lake, great people, affordable prices, and they will show you where the walleye are, also great pike and laker fishing on Sturgeon. Lots of nice lakes up and down 599."
526336,Behle,2003-01-09 10:31:00,51,we have never had any problems with them. They are usually on time if weather permits and we have always been able to pack in everything that we want to bring. The lake we fly in to is at Allenwater Bridge and our flight is only about 20 minutes long so the weight of our stuff has not been a real problem. Their rates are cheaper than their competitor and we can also get our licenses there while we wait for the plane to come in. This saves us time at camp.Allenwater is on Lake Kawawaegoema which is outside the western edge of Wabakimi Park. The river is the brightsand and flows out of Seseganaga. Walleyes and Northerns are the two species available.

Rates seem quite reasonable. Just wondering if anyone has any experience with this outfitter, and how the walleye fishing rates in this general area compared to other areas in NW Ontario. Thanks. Rob"
