527045,Guest,2003-01-30 01:52:00,0,"First it was our gun laws. The law sucks & all it did was make me a criminal. I WILL NOT register my guns....... they have to FIND them before they can bust me. I do know that they won't find them ! :-}NOW, I read this...... and it really disturbs me. I'm no fan of our current dictatorship er, I mean GOV'T. I hate the way that we ""elect"" our dic's, er AGAIN I mean GOV'T. Polls not closed in Manitoba & out west.... and we already know who our next dic's, er GOV'T is....BUT NOW....... this ? These DIC's are unreal ! I'm lost for words ! To be honest, I'm thinking that before ole G.W.Bush heads over to Iraq to ##### slap them MoFo's, he needs a practice run ! Well G.W , please visit OTTAWA and ##### slap ole' Jean ! Like I said, UNREAL ! I love Canada for what we have (outdoors/fishing) but, enough is enough ! HECK, for all I know this post has been censored & they are now tracking me down ! Sure wish I had a green card so I could blow this popcorn stand ! WrD"
527046,Guest,2003-01-30 01:56:00,0,gee.....guess that first post is rather silly. IN my ANGER I forgot to add the artical I was refering to....... sorry. JUST really not a happy guy.......http://www.mywinnipeg.sympatico.ca/N...d=996681129015WrD

527048,Guest,2003-02-01 21:01:00,0,"I always get criticised for my view on these issues or my posts get yanked but here goes. You need to get three things and study them and tell several other people to do the same to create awareness. ( the first step toward change) The Magna Carta of 1215(still law here, we asked the Queen) The Canadian bill of rights The U.N. declaration of human rights. You can either start to research the alternative truth or continue to be furious at the current legal ""illusion"" we are trapped by. Sorry to sound harsh but I understand and sympathize with your anger. If you think you are angry now , wait till you read the Magna Carta and realize how much of it is totally violated by statute law. "" No freeman shall be arbitrarily dissiezed of his property except by lawful judgement, by a jury of his peers, under the law of the land""There's one to wet your appetite!"
527049,Guest,2003-02-02 15:02:00,0,"We all have choices...you can move. Go to the states. You may find that the grass is not always greener on the other side of the fence. Lots of Canadians go there and lots come back. Freedom is also an interesting word. In the land of the free they have travel restrictions placed on them, they cannot travel to Cuba, they can be made to have arbitrary Drug testing at work, they also have the most people per capita other than Russia in jail. They commonly disenfranchise people (mostly blacks) after a felony conviction and even after they have paid their price to society they still cannot vote. All these things are highly illegal in Canada or as some Americans call us Canuckistan."
527050,River_eye,2003-02-02 23:05:00,1486,"Hey CG, a few of the guys on the general discussion board think I'm this big anti-american, and I must admit, I'm critical of their government as well as ours, but I don't think I'd go so far to post what you just did. Whether I agree with you or not is irrelevant, but it seems that you are continually looking for ways to piss the Americans off.Hopefully the rest of the Canadians on this board don't catch any flack for this one."
527051,musky master,2003-02-03 07:19:00,2,"In Canada you still have the right to whine, piss and moan about the ""ridiculous"" firearms registration laws. Last time I looked we still have to register our snowmobiles and haven't heard anyone threatening to bury them in their backyard. I was told by Minnesota friends that they had some form of registration process to go through when buying any firearm....how can this be!! Maybe it just makes sense. My suggestion to all the whiners out there .....just bite the bullet and register the ##### thing. If you think that owning a firearm does not carry some form of resposibility then perhaps there is a place for you in some other country that will not limit your personnal freedoms.....how about Somalia (nice winter weather)!"
527052,Guest,2003-02-05 20:10:00,0,"Just because some other country's have it worse is no reason not to expect that we could have it better here. I hear from some worldly travelling freinds of mine that a lot of countries are better than Canada.Universal health care, big deal. Give me back all my income tax money and I'll by my own health care plan and have money left over.Most people are so busy argueing about what they see on the news every day they aren't able to focus on anything else.The only truth they will accept is one that come from a so called "" recognized authority"".The gun registry is a waste of time and money. I for one am amazed that humanity has survived this long considering that we pass another 100 laws every week that are supposedly for our security. How did we ever make it to this point without the 10,000 we passed in a mere 20 years of our recent existence.Wake up and think, think, think, instead of regurgitating some garbage you read in the frigging paper.News is CHEWING GUM FOR THE BRAIN !!!!!I oppose the gun registry because it sends a message to parliament to stop wasting money and energy on futile, special interest motivated bull$hit."
527053,Guest,2003-02-06 00:53:00,0,"You must be a frigging liberal. HEy, it will only cost 2 mill for the gun registry. WAIT, let's spend a billion.... it can only make it better ! Am I opposed to gun laws, yes. However to ""own"" a gun (non restricted) I am subject to getting a FAC. In the USA, the purpose of regis a gun is actually a ""waiting period"" so they can find out if your elevator runs to all floors. To us canucks, this is also the process that the FAC is for. IN Canada the process to get a permit so you can have ""restricted"" guns is VERY difficult to obtain. I know, because I have one. Can I carry my gun when I want to ? NOT A CHANCE. I get to take it out of the house, drive the shortest / most direct route to the range and then back home. I cannot stop for ANY reason while carrying it on my person. It must be in a locked case & must not be able to be fired. (gun & ammo cannot be together) I cannot store it in my OWN HOME without it being in a locked case, trigger lock & ammo seperate. Do I follow these rules.....yes I do. But what the Dic's are doing with ""NEW"" gun laws........ these they can stick up their arse ! You telling me that a old 22 cal., sitting in a cabin somewhere, stored PROPERLY (trigger locked) and ammo seperate is a ""THREAT"" ? I suggest to you , you need to attend some therapy. Given the name you use ""MUSKY""...... you must be really confused on a whole lotta things. TIP for you...... this is a WALLEYE board ! I'd bet you were one of the people who celebrated when they passed motorcycle helmet laws ? I wouldn't be surprised.You missed the gist of my original post........... IF you take the time to read the link...... you might understand why I as a NORMAL CANUCK am getting sick & tired of these IDIOTS who run our country.We are taxed beyond reasonable grounds.... 43% PERSONAL INCOME TAX ??? Then prov tax & GST & the FUtax... I say, let me KEEP my hard earned money. I'll look after myself, a HECK of a lot better than what the dic's have done for most of this country. (ask any cash strapped senior OR war vet) The Grand MArshall of the Idiot Parade (Chretien) hasn't got the chutzpah to say, WE SUPPORT THE USA against Iraq. I pay my taxes( I have no choice, they STEAL it off of every pay cheque) BUT, do the Dic's represent my PERSONAL opinion ? NOT A CHANCE ! Well, as a guy who pays our dic's & pays & pays & pays, I say to our American Family..... our dic's may not have the chutzpah to say they support you.... but the CANADIAN PEOPLE do ! Last time I looked....y'all is Yanks & we be Canucks.....but in the BIG picture we all be NORTH AMERICANS ! I am so sorry I ranted (kinda outta charecter)but this clown hit the right button ! I tell yah...... some people should be REAL glad this isn't a dark alley......WrD"
527054,musky master,2003-02-06 07:34:00,2,"The crux of the matter is whether or not the benefits outway the risks....the risks being (from what I can see)the excessive expenditure of money. The benefits will be in numbers of lives saved......money vs lives......the jury is still out on this. Do I think too much has been spent...of course...is that a reason to scrap it after taking it this far...I don't think so. Does it change anything as far as making the majority of sportsmen and gun owners ""safer""....not likely. Will it reduce the numbers of gun related fatalities....I believe it will.WrD...your original post was a ""piss and moan"" about your oppression in this country. I happen to disagree.....I guess that makes me a clown. I love this country for more than its fishing and hunting...this includes our health care system (which takes care of that senior and war vet you mention) which I think is one of our best investment of tax dollars. Just compare our economy to that of our debt ridden neighbour to the south....who is running a tighter ship? As far as wondering why I, the musky master, should dare come on board this ""walleye"" site.......tell me how gun laws and taxes relate to walleye fishing. By the way where you thinking of pistols at 20 yards in this ""dark alley"" you were hoping to meet in? Sounds like a productive way to end an arguement!Chill out dude....lets agree to disagree..:P"
