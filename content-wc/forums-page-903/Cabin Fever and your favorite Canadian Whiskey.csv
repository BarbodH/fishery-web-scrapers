The problem with Crown, however, is that it is a bit pricey.If you want another option, at a lesser price, try Wiser's. It costs about 1/3 less than Crown Royal and tastes almost as good. I suggest on your next trip up north, pick up a bottle of Wiser's at the Liquor Store and give it a whirl...you won't be disappointed."

527283,WillieB,2003-02-05 11:37:00,292,"Jameson is fine stuff, and the only good Irish whisky you'll find in a traditional Catholic pub....But on the other hand...Bushmills IS the worlds oldest licensed distillery (1608) and would be my choice, be it in a Protestant pub or by the evenings fire listening to the loons...either one will do just fine......"
527284,Guest,2003-02-05 15:32:00,0,Gibsons is the best. It beats Crown Royal hands down. Smoooth. Crown Royal is overpriced and overrated.
527285,Guest,2003-02-05 18:34:00,0,"IvyAll this talk about good whiskey. I'll take the Blue over the whiskey any day. But it doesn't get any better then a bottle of Captain Morgan with a six pack of Coke, a bag of pretzels and a crisp cold night in the Canadian widerness. With the job and wife hundreds of miles away.Come on August!Bigfish"
527286,Guest,2003-02-06 07:39:00,0,"Bigfish,I see that nail you hit on the head.If my slide ruler still works, I see 190 days left till we go! I think.You know I never been good at all that fancy cipher'en.I think I officially have ""The Fever"". Take last night for instance:I came home and Christian met me at the door with his Star Wars light Saber and his Power Ranger mask.( he was the border patrol ). He asked me where I was from, and if I had any firearms or any booze to declare.Ivy"

527288,Hammerhead Herb,2003-02-07 15:01:00,259,"In that same vein, our group will have one last nightcap about 10PM. Sitting around the campfire we will make up a pot of decaf coffee and our in a shot or two of Nailey's Irish Cream. Boy that's good."
527271,Guest,2003-02-04 09:04:00,0,"O.K. O.K. I should be working but I just sent in the deposit for our Fly-out and I'm ever so distracted.We have had opinions on everyones favorite beer. But what about good Canadian Whiskey? What is your favorite?I have always been partial to Crown Royal. In fact, I bought a bottle of Special Reserve ($48.00 in the States) and still have not found the perfect time to open it.Maybe tonight while looking at my Cabela's catalog.Ivy"" I gotta stop wish'en I gotta go fish'en I'm down to rock bottom again"" - Buffet"
527272,Guest,2003-02-04 14:47:00,0,"If you kind of like Crown Royal ,you will love Wiser's . It's a Canadian rye. Hang on to your hat"
527273,Guest,2003-02-04 14:55:00,0,"Why stop at Canadian, it's great, but try Jameson's Irish on the rocks. Great stuff!!!!!"
527274,Guest,2003-02-04 16:00:00,0,Are these smoother than Crown or are they a little more robust?Ivy
527275,Guest,2003-02-04 17:02:00,0,"best wiskey of any kind ,any where just happens to be whatever you happen to have...tell me that you're out and the only thing i have is old grand dad,i'll bet all of a sudden that you will agree.drink it all,don't want it to rot!!!!!"
527276,River_eye,2003-02-04 17:33:00,1486,"I am a fan of Crown Royal as well, but I also like Schenley, OFC or Golden wedding It's smoother than Crown royal and a little nicer for shots out of the flask."
527277,lobo1,2003-02-04 17:48:00,734,for the money you cant go wrong with V.O.
527278,chrism,2003-02-04 21:16:00,429,I'll trade my Canadian whiskey anytime for a good bottle of JDaniels reserve!
527279,Guest,2003-02-05 08:15:00,0,Give me a Diet Dr Pepper and a bottle of Tequila and I can get as sick as any of you.
527280,Guest,2003-02-05 08:26:00,0,"Buy the Crown Royal at the duty free stores and save around 50%. If you feel lucky, try bringing a few extra 1.75's with you, otherwise it's still a great deal if you declare them and pay the duty tax!"
