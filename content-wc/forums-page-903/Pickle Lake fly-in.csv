527507,Rob,2003-02-08 12:55:00,103,"Hi all - our group has booked a fly-in trip this June out of Pickle Lake, with Albany River Outfitters. Anyone have any experience with this outfitter, or with the lakes in this general area? We've flown out of Nakina, Armstrong, and Red Lake in the past 10-15 years, but just wanted to try something different. Any suggestions/advice that anyone can provide would be much appreciated. Thanks much. Rob[email protected]"
