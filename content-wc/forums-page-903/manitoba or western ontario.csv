527257,Mike KS,2003-02-04 10:02:00,18,"andy h....Our group of six went many years to Lac Seul. About six years ago we decided to explore Manitoba Fly Ins. We went on four different trips in four years and really enjoyed all of the trips. We have gone back to Lac Seul the last two years. The fishing at Lac Seul is as good as it gets. We catch just as many fish on Lac Seul and more big ones than we did on our fly ins...and the money savings is significant fishing at Lac Seul. To me the most important ingredient for success is who you go with and the fishing is a bonus. You wont go wrong on Lac Seul but you will also find some great times in Manitoba. Just type Manitoba Walleye Fishing into your search engine and the world will open up to you....Good Luck,Good Fishing,Catch and Release."

527259,Guest,2003-02-04 10:32:00,0,"Andy,have nothing but good thing to say about Lac Suel fishing and we went last year in late July. I not sure how Manitoba could beat it because we caught hundreds of Walleywe and three Northern between 15-20 lbs; including two on my old green Jitterbug. Ironically, we didn't even fish that much for Northern."
527260,Mike KS,2003-02-04 12:52:00,18,2Fishy4U....Would you like to sell that old green Jitterbug??? We have had the same type of results on Lac Seul as you. It dont get any better. We caught several bonus Big Pike last year while jigging for Walleye. We also have done well on several nice Smallmouth while Walleye fishing. We fish the South East section and it is relativly boat free and GREAT FISHING.
