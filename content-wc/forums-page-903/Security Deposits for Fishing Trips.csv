526983,Jesse-WI,2003-01-30 22:52:00,534,"I had a long discussion one year with a lodge owner on this topic.Cancellations are a big deal in this business. The window of opportunity can be very small. People start looking early and if your place is full during the time they want, they go look else where. If that week opens up later due to cancellations, the spot is usually not filled. If they set the deposit to high to cover there loss, nobody wants to make a firm booking commitment. These open spots can lead to higher prices for everyone next year. Some camp supplies are ordered early to gain volumn discounts. This can lead to having excess inventory. If deposits are not given back, people feel slighted and go elsewhere in the future.This means long time customers get the benefit of the doubt where new bookings usually do not. It is usually dealt with on a case by case issue. Most any owner will cut you a break if an emergency happens the week you are there.There really is 2 sides to every story."
526984,Backwater Eddy,2003-01-31 05:30:00,3871,"If the camp was wise, he would at least offer an incentive option.The 60 day deal is cutting it close. Although stuff happens and some consideration should be given, you didn't stiff him the whole booking anyway.He could have offered you the $100 as a roll over to a future booking, but you loose it, for now, on this booking. That way you and he both have an incentive to work together.I always offer a rescheduling option before canceling a deposit, reschedule would depend on availability of openings. In fact, I have never canceled a deposit, we always work it out for this season or the next. I want my clients to return, not go elsewhere because I am a hard case about picky ##### details.Go Fish...have fun!Ed ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson...><sUMo>""Backwater Guiding"""
526985,Guest,2003-01-31 13:07:00,0,"It seems to me, that the deposit ...IN FULL..should have gone towards the total bill.(I was in that business myself for 25 years). That way you could wrestle with your buddies to get your deposit money back."
526979,Guest,2003-02-05 21:22:00,0,"Tip the lodge owner? I don't think so. Definately the dock boy, the housekeeper and the guide, but the owner - You Have Got To Be Kiddn' Me!! Get serious!"
526987,Thumper,2003-02-05 21:59:00,133,"If you cancelled an American Plan with short notice, then the lodge owner may have actually incurred some expenses by 1 of the 11-member group not being there. If you were all staying the in same cabin, and assuming that you were over the camp owner's minimum group size for the cabin, then I would have fully expected the full deposit to be applied to the group's bill.There's no way with 60-90 day's notice that an 11-person group having 1 member drop out causes the camp owner any loss what-so-ever. If that camp owner is so inflexible, then I probably wouldn't want to go back to that camp, either.I notice that you haven't given the camp's name. I suppose that keeps this thread at an ideological level, instead of a vendeta.Would your group have re-booked there if that $100 wasn't an issue?- Rick ""Thumper"" Torgerud"
526986,Backwater Eddy,2003-02-06 06:29:00,3871,"I agree, T-Mac, that is a given. The deposit should be deducted from the total tab. If it was above and beyond the bill, that is dam suspicious for sure.(Some folks try to turn back their odometers. Not me, I want people to know ""why"" I look this way. I've traveled a long way, and the road less traveled isn't paved.) Ed ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson..><sUMo>"
526988,Roadhog,2003-02-06 14:00:00,17,"Unfortunately, the security deposit issue was not the only problem our group had at the camp. In the owner's defense, I was given the option of applying the deposit to a return trip in 2003. Due to the other experiences the other members of the group had at the camp we decided, as a group, not to go back. This was in spite of the fact that the fishing was better than average...members of our group caught 3 walleyes @ 10#s or larger. My purpose for the post was not to cry about being out the $100.00 deposit. My point was to point out the fact to all people booking trips to be aware of each camp's rules and regulations before booking their trips. It is my opinion that the good business people will work with you in these matters, as opposed to the camp owners who are in it for the money and have to go to all the fishing shows each year to get ""new meat"" for their camps. I haven't given the name of the camp in this post because I wanted to keep the posting from degenerating to ""name calling. If anyone wants the name they can e-mail me as I am going register with Walleye Central and you can get my e-mail address from my profile."
526972,Roadhog,2003-01-28 16:44:00,17,"Last year our group of 11 fishermen made reservations for a camp in NW Ontario booking on the American Plan. I was in charge of the trip and submitted a payment of $1100.00 to reserve our week at the camp. I sent in the check approximately 6 months in advance. About 3 months before our departure a family matter came up that precluded me from going on the trip. I called the camp owners and told them that we would have a party of 10. In the brochure from the camp there was a mention of ""NO REFUNDS"" of deposits. I should mention that our group was staying in one cabin so no cabin bookings were lost by the camp owner. I made the assumption, incorrectly, that the $1100.00 deposit would be applied to our final bill. When the final bill was presented at the end of our group's stay, $1000.00 was credited to our bill. I was out my $100.00 deposit. When I called the camp owner to plead my case, I was told that there were no refunds on deposits. I can live without the $100.00 but it sems to me that there should be some give-and-take in regards to these deposits. The camp owner may have kept my money but our group is booked in a different camp for 2003."

526974,ggg,2003-01-28 17:21:00,115,Please tell us the name of the camp.
526975,fishinnut,2003-01-28 17:32:00,642,Good for you!!!!!! I can understand keeping the deposit if your whole group cancelled but not in your situation.
526976,Roadhog,2003-01-29 07:37:00,17,"Along the same lines as my post, I am aware of some lodges in NW Ontario that will charge a fishing party for the total number of people booked. For instance, if you have a party of 7 and one person can't make the trip you are still charged the full price for a group of 7 people! The main point of my post is to read the brochure you get from the camp and make sure these matters are addressed before your group commits to the camp. In my opinion, camps that want to charge you for members who, for some reason or another, cannot make the trip, should be avoided. This also goes for camps that refuse to refund your deposit. It might be helpful to tell the camp operators why you aren't booking at their camp and maybe this practice would change."
526977,duffy,2003-01-29 08:10:00,49,"I am not saying this what i believe but I will play devils advocate here. If you book a trip with Disney and if you need to cancel with less than 60 days before your trip date you loose all of your money with no exceptions. Lodge opeartors have only one thng to sell and thats space for a very short time frame. If they hold a spot for you and you can't fullfill it then the lodge operator is stuck if the cancelation comes after the booking season. If you can't make the trip the lodge still has to pay his staff, fly his planes, put gas in the boats, maintian the equiptment etc...... I think the fair thing here is to give back the deposit in full if the cacellation is made 90 days prior to the trip which gives the lodge operator time to re-book your spot. If the cancellation is made with less than 90 days then the deposit can only be used for downpayment on a future trip. It is totally unfair to charge the full amount to the rest of the group. Whatever the case make sure you read the terms and conditions of your lodge choice and discuss it when making your booking. Also trip insurance is also available at fairly reasonable rates. Just my opinion take it for what it's worth.Tight linesDuffy"
526978,Guest,2003-01-29 23:43:00,0,"If perhaps one person was added to the trip, would the lodge for go the extra $100 deposit, seems it should work both ways! Could have always deducted $100 from the tip!"
526980,Trailerguy,2003-01-30 10:15:00,1407,"I think the lodge owner scruwed u, and you are right to not go back. I once checked in to camp and started fishing on Saturday afternoon. While we were out on the lake an emergency call came from home, my father-in-law was hospitalized with a stroke. We immediatly packed up and headed home. The owner insisted on giving me a full refund, at that moment I didn't care. He applied the the full week I'd paid for to my next summers trip. That's just one reason I spent 24 years returning to his camp."
526981,Minnow Man,2003-01-30 17:43:00,85,"Would like to know what you would say if your crew of 6 men showed up at the resort with you deposits paid and the resort owner told you he was sorry but he rented the cabin to a larger group or how about if you booked a package plan to include boats and motors, and the resort owner said sorry have no boats left, you can fish off the docks for the week. Would it start with i paid my deposit and i want.........What do you think the purpose of a deposit is????Can hardly wait to get back on the water."
526982,Guest,2003-01-30 20:20:00,0,"Roadhog---You book a trip 6 mos. in advance, can't make it, and are out $100 bucks and whine????? If a ""family matter"" excluded you, you still whine???? How important was that ""family matter""???? You could never come on a fishing trip with me!!!!!!!"
