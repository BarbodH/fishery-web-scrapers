527017,Guest,2003-02-05 18:33:00,0,"Hello all,I might not have the total experience of the fella's above but I do fish almost every day and I have caught my share of 10 lb walleyes and monster Northern. I have had numerous rods break in half on me. The fishing pole I prefer is the 7 foot Ugly Stick. The are very sensitive and have good control so you can feel even the slightest of bites. I may be only 21 but fishing is my life right now and i would not switch to any other pole. ""That's just my opinion, I could be wrong."""
527018,River_eye,2003-02-05 19:11:00,1486,"Your age doesn't mean anything, most of the guys here probably don't know I'm 21 too."
527019,Vitreum,2003-02-05 19:27:00,221,"kodiak, i've got 3 or 4 high priced graphites and you are right. ugly stiks are hard to beat, especially for the money. if someone told me that i could have only one rod to last the rest of my life and i had to depend on it to eat, i believe i'd pick an ugly stik."
527010,Piscatorian,2003-01-29 21:36:00,12,"7"" medium action St. Croix LE spinning. No question."
527007,River_eye,2003-01-29 23:11:00,1486,"Shoot you found me out. I was going to cut and paste that same post to at least three more discussions for maxiumum advertising but I can't now. :-(In reality, if I owned berkley, I'd buy walleye central."
527005,River_eye,2003-01-29 23:17:00,1486,"It's okay stewart, I took a jab at him for posting the exact same lodge promoting post three times or more. It made me a bit susupicious. He just jabbed back."
527011,T Bone,2003-01-30 10:57:00,18,"I've used a Berkley Phazer for about 10 years and love it...6' one-piece Med Fast....great walleye rod. I received a 6' St. Croix last year as a gift to ""replace"" my old Phazer and it's also very nice....very sensitive.Unfortunately, I don't believe Berkley markets the ""Phazer"" anymore, but they may have just renamed it. If anyone has a clue to the new name, let me know."
527012,GLO,2003-01-31 17:01:00,318,"Used a 6' medium action and 6'6"" medium light action Techna AVs last year for jigging and really enjoyed them. Like the ML Techna every bit as much as my similar St. Croix."
527013,aaron,2003-01-31 22:44:00,6,"ST.CROIX is a good rod! My 10year old ""power pole"" still is #1 for sheer durability.I tried a shimano B.I signature series and for the price,i would stay with ST.CROIX.I hate people trying to get free plugs for ""dead lodges"" go and do a home show you ""crap bone""."
527014,Ohio fisherman,2003-02-01 10:25:00,989,"For spinning: Loomis Walleye series 7 foot two piece rod. It will do everything well.For casting: None, I'll take the cash equivalent or another of above.Ohio fisherman"
527015,fishmaster,2003-02-04 17:36:00,209,What ever happen to the famous words I'm a Fenwick man???but I also like my Ugly stick.I ahve been using Fenwicks for 25 years now and love them they held up over the years but allways wanted an ugly stick so bought one last year and love and it catches fish just like my old Garcia rods.
527016,River_eye,2003-02-04 17:41:00,1486,"I don't own a fenwick, but my next rod will be either Berkley or Fenwick, they are distributed by the same company, Pure Fishing Canada, and have given me better warranty service than St. Croix, especially if you go right to their place in Portage la Prarie."
527008,Dave,2003-02-05 14:44:00,258,"River Eye,Any one who reads these posts with any regularity is well aware of bassmanjc's frequent and repetitive posts, at the very least he could re write the ad's from time to time."
526997,Guest,2003-01-28 17:07:00,0,Just wondering what your personal preference of rod is. If you could have only two rods (one for spinning one for casting) what would they be?
526998,Stevie B,2003-01-29 07:28:00,157,Bang for your buck nothing comes close to the Berkley Lighting Rods! Spining or Casting!Keep on Fishing!
526999,Guest,2003-01-29 09:17:00,0,I have an assortment but I would really miss my Shimano Sensilte rods if I every broke or lost them.
527000,River_eye,2003-01-29 09:40:00,1486,"Spinning: I have a St. Croix avid which is nice, but priceyI used a Rapala long cast last year, which was great for the price $65 ($45 US), but if I was to only have one I'd get a Berkley Series One, because of great value for the sensitivity and a better warranty than St croix up here in Canada.Casting: I've grown really attached to a 7' ML Falcon crankbait rod. Very slow action, allows you to tell if the bait is running right and whether it's hitting the bottom."
527001,Guest,2003-01-29 10:09:00,0,"River_eye,It seems that you are part owner of, or affiliated with berkley. If berkley wants advertising they should pay walleye central."
527002,lunker99,2003-01-29 11:20:00,236,"I'm not associated with Berkley, but would agree with river eye and stevie about them producing great rods for the value minded sportsman. I'm sure other brands do too, but I started using Berkley rods several years ago and they haven't gave me a reason to switch yet."
527003,lunker99,2003-01-29 11:32:00,236,"Oh, forgot to add my choice. I would second the vote for the lightning rods for spinning. Medium action IM6 rod has enough back-bone to give good hooksets while jigging or rigging. It's also still limber enough to give cranks and harnesses good lively action while trolling. Don't own any casting rods so can't honestly recommend anything."
527004,stewart,2003-01-29 14:30:00,100,"Why jump all over River_Eye for his opinion? The question is about brands, so they have to be named... Anyways, I think that was uncalled for Bassmanjc. I like my Loomis 722 because it's versatile, and just feels nice and light to handle. Pricey rod though, so I guess I'm some sort of elitist. The Series One series are very Loomis-like, and much less money. I have an Avid baitcaster, but find it kind of too stiff for all around use..."
527006,Vitreum,2003-01-29 16:12:00,221,"bassmanjc, you really need to chill. just because river-eye pointed out that you are a shill for campfire island lodge, you don't need to get ugly. anyone who knows how to use search on this board realizes that you constantly use cut and paste promos for this lodge. at the prices they charge, one would think that they could afford to advertise."
527009,Guest,2003-01-29 17:50:00,0,"I've guided and used a Berkley Lightning Rod for over 14 yrs and it's still going strong, I've got 3 different ones and they are a good value considering the abuse they get in the guide boat and the responsiveness for the dollar. I've also got the Shimano V-rod; SWEET but a bit pricey for the average guy. Had lots that don't make it through a season, of all brands."
