527323,Guest,2003-02-05 07:46:00,0,"I would definitly get a guide especially in that area because all those lakes as you probably know are connected and under quite a bit af pressure. The Guide would be able to take you up into Pipestone where you probably wouldn't go without a guide due to the fact there are no maps produced by MNR. With the money you are spending on a trip why not a little bit more for a guide to give you moreof a chance to stay on fish. I don't mean to say you can't fish but the patterns could be different than you are familiar with.Rip some lip,"

We're going with a large group so we can split the cost and be sure we have two Wally dinners a day!!!"
