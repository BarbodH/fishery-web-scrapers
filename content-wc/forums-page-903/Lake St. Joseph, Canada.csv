526654,Fred_G,2003-01-21 18:10:00,908,"Milt,I wonder if you're talking about the same Old Post & Village that I have been going to for the last seven years. We have never been required to take a guide in all of that time. Some of our party does hire a guide every year ( the same one for the last 7 years) only because they enjoy fishing with a guide. It's also great to have them fix your shore lunch. Granted, there are many hazards in the lake, but if you're careful you can fish the lake on your own. I have found the map that the camp has is very good. I've gotten to many areas with no problem just by using the map.We also take our own boats every year, although the camp boats are more than adequate. You are correct that there are no docks. But with the huge sand beach that the camp has there really is no need.As for having to go out an hour to catch fish, I have had excellent success within sight of camp. The only reason the guides take people out to the other areas of the lake is that it provides a greater number of options. If one spot isn't producing there are many others available.The guides at the camp put in very long days. I don't blame them for wanting to relax in the evening. Their day starts at 6 a.m. and by the time they finish cleaning their clients fish for the day it's usually after 7 p.m. I think they deserve to have a beer or two and relax in the evening.John Grace does take a little getting used to. I wasn't sure about him the first time I met him, but I have come to respect him because he runs an excellent camp. Everyone that works for John will go out of thir way to make your stay the best. I wouldn't be going back every year if that weren't the case.Fred"
526655,Guest,2003-01-22 18:19:00,0,"Fred_G: My two college age sons and I are going to the Old Post this spring (will start fishing the Wednesday of Memorial Day week). Do you have any tips for walleye hot spots that early in the season? I've been there 4 times in September (including my last trip up there during 9/11/01)and once in June and have enjoyed all that the camp & the lake have to offer, but we have usually fished at least 20 miles & more from camp. If you have any thoughts on places between camp and Boulder City, I'd appreciate it. Any info is appreciated. I'll be sure to reciprocate by filling you in after we get back. Thanks in advance!"

526657,Rick,2003-01-23 15:05:00,226,"I brought my boat in and parked it on the nice beach you are referring to. In the middle of the night, a storm hit and my boat was gone, blew her against the east shore, took us all day to find her. And about that map, worst one I have ever seen. Very few hazards are marked on it. Owner did not really care about my problem."
526658,Guest,2003-01-23 15:06:00,0,I didn't bring my boat and I had to take a guide to use theirs. Nobody told me that when I booked. Couldn't go out at night either. I thought the place was a rip.

526660,Guest,2003-02-07 07:40:00,0,"I didn't like the fact that I had to pay a guy to watch my car so the natives didn't strip it. Lake was very hazardous with the poorest map I have ever seen. Lodge was OK, but the owner is a different cat. A lot better choices than that one. Can't hold a candle to Lac Seul, trust me on that. And not as far. It was snowing in August."
526661,Guest,2003-02-07 10:32:00,0,Could you help us all out?
526644,Guest,2003-01-18 16:44:00,0,Looking for a Canadian fishing trip for 8 guys I keep hearing good things about this lake. I have heard guarantee of 75 Walleye a day type stuff. I have also heard of a Old Post that is a great place to stay while at the lake. I'll be dammed if I can find it on a map. Wondering how far north on the canada/minnesota line Any inputs? Jeff s
526645,Vitreum,2003-01-18 17:04:00,221,http://www.lwcb.ca/ this should give you a general idea where it is.
526647,Fred_G,2003-01-18 17:20:00,908,The Old Post website is www.oldpost.com. THe camp is great. ANd 75 fish per day is accurate. This year will be my seventh year at The Old Post. Can't wait to get back up there.Fred
526648,River_eye,2003-01-18 18:36:00,1486,"Also check out www.slatefallsoutposts.comthere will be a map there. I believe they operate a small camp of three cabins, one staff member on this lake."
526646,Guest,2003-01-19 08:56:00,0,"The internet address is great. I was going to go to the book store and get some sort of Canadian Map type thing. I now can see the Lac Suel & St Joseph are side by side lokes off the same river system. Both, lakes ahve been highly pushed in my ""asking of all these stupid questions"". I'm getting excited now......Planning is 1/2 the fun. Thanx"
526649,Guest,2003-01-19 10:06:00,0,"You can get a free map of northwestern Ontario by going to www.sunsetcountry.net or www.heartland.on.ca both are good sites if you aren't familiar with the area. You will be bombarded by camps sending you emails, and brocheres in the mail, but it's worth the hassel to get the maps."
526650,Guest,2003-01-20 11:19:00,0,If you don't catch 100 walleyes a day you are having a bad day. Old Post is a great lodge and they will put you on fish although the walleyes are not hard to find. My group fished 3 1/2 days and boated over 370 walleyes. Enjoy.
526651,Guest,2003-01-20 11:56:00,0,What time of the year are you planning for ?I was at Lake St. Joe last Sept. with Slate Falls outposts! Sure is a great time of the year to go. Have been on a fly-in for the last 11 years in Sept.
526652,River_eye,2003-01-20 18:59:00,1486,"tell me, what is slatefalls outpost like on LSJ? I hear they have a camp attendant on hand, just one? what does he help with? do you tip him much?"
526653,Guest,2003-01-21 13:50:00,0,"The truth about Old Post Village is that you have to take a guide and you have to travel quite a distance to get walleyes. You can't bring your own boat cause there is no docking. Early season, fishing was within an hour of camp, and later on it was much further away. The map is terrible and the lake is very hazardous. It is no comparison to Lac Seul even though they are not that far apart. The northerns are probably more abundant on St. Joe. I wasn't allowed to fish after dinner at St. Joseph/Old Post cause the guides would rather drink beer. So for me, I thought it very mediocre. Furthermore, I had to pay someone to guard my car as the natives will stip it right down at St. Joseph. Now if all that sounds good to you, be my guest. I didn't think the Old Post owners were all that friendly either, but would give them a C- average. The girls did a good job in the lodge though. Cabins were nice."
