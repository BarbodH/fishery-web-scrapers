SECOND you do not know I am, but I put alot of volunteer time into the welfare of fishing and hunting in this country and don't take a PENNY for it. For the last time I do not have a problem with the event, but it should have been posted in Canadian dollars not US dollars. That is the only thing I see wrong with it.

526630,Todd_NE,2003-01-31 14:28:00,1330,"I want to make a really important point here folks.Like many of you, I get pretty involved in economic development efforts locally and all that jazz. I'm trying to put myself in Larry's position (god forbid) and understand his point of view.Here goes with an analogy, I think a simple one.I live on pretty ok Catfish river. Ok in Nebraska means we get 50 fish a day, pretty much all 8-14"" with an occasional (ok, once in a lifetime) 30# plus thrown in to boot.Let's say that Larry wants to have a tourney down here for US and Canada residents, most being Canadian residents.Would I, or the community, give a rat about what currency the tourney is in or where the people are from? Particularly if it was a border tourney where the money is commonly interchanged?Heck no.Fact is, we'd think it was cool, support it, and hope it drove more tourism cuz those big fish (ok, little Cornhusker cats) aren't going to get ate or kept and will probably have a 99% return alive rate. I imagine local cafe's would be stocking up on gravy for fries, vinegar, and Kokanee to make people feel welcome. Motels would have signs saying ""Three Canucks per double for the price of Four"" (Joke, transpose that)The $$ conversion doesn't matter either way on the money, most can do that in their head. But I can tell you that Dallas, Stu, and Eddy have done MORE for Canada than Larry ever has in his godgiven life unless I'm wayyyyy off. How much fuel, food, bait, guiding, entertainment money etc. do these guys drive to the Selkirk/Lockport/Winnipeg area? Now take that times how many years in the past. (I know others contributed too and they'd be the first to say it)Probably MILLIONS in Canuck funds (I couldn't resist).So Larry, in the words of my grandfather. ""You can call it manure or fertilizer, but its still the same thing and you are spreading it where it isn't warranted"".Thanks guys for putting on a tourney, and most of all for all the great INFORMATION that brings tourism dollars in by the bushel loads. I don't remember reading about Larry in the In-Fish and all the great things he's done.Sincerly,Moe and Curlynuck nuck nuck nuck"

I suspect they will be again this year. By jumping all over ""Cat"" about this now just for posting a early event announcement is just plain nuts! Somebody else is organizing the event anyway, and will likely post the ""Official Entry"" details very soon. I would also suspect it will be posted in both Canadian and US friendly text, for the participating anglers convenience.I am sure ""Cat"" was allowing all us anglers, both US and/or Canadian, some extra time to plan ahead.

LOL.:)But seriously, when I had that Saturday morning off to flyfish with Stu T. last year (on the opening morning of the tournament). I was impressed by how smoothly everything ran. I can't say for sure if I'll be able to do it this year but I'd sure like too ;) I even remember seeing this ""viagra-blue"", as I believe someone referred to a particular tri-hull boat in front of the curtains.......was that you Ed?

Changing the entry format over to U.S. currency only makes sense considering that the majority of contestants were from south on the 49th.Besides what do you care, you never have or for that matter don't plan on fishing the event anyway. ""Confused"", ya just a little! Another point I'll make now that I've apparently got your undivided attention, ""no participant has complained to date about this pending event"", I'll be more than glad to address the issue with them ""if"" it arises! I don't suppose that you'd be interested in identifying yourself, when it's starts to get personnal I like to know who I'm dealing with!? Besides you know who I am, I think it only fair that I know who you are, what do you say, Larry!Fish ""Hard"" Forever!"

526589,Larry,2003-01-24 09:38:00,357,"""Cat""illac man First of all I am not getting personnal and I do not know who you are and lets leave it at that. I do not understand, why you are so up in arms, after all is Dallas Stevenson not the tournament organizer. I was only inquiring in reasoning behind charging US dollars for a tournament, that is taking place in Canada. Could some explain, why more information was posted about the tournament on Walleye Central US website, than Cat eye Outfitters Canadian website. I think I know why. No if I have to pay in US dollars for an event in Canada, I will not take part and I do not think I stand alone on this. After all Wal-Mart's prices are Canadian dollars. I hope this tournament is a big success for it organizers. It is to bad, that whole point of this exercise was to stess to, ""THINK CANADIAN"" was missed.Have a good day to all in both counties.Yes and fish hardThe Canadian anglerLarry"
526590,Guest,2003-01-24 09:40:00,0,It seems to me that Larry is worrying to much about what kind of currency the payout will be. What if Larry doesent WIN...no worrys when that happens.
526591,Backwater Eddy,2003-01-24 10:38:00,3871,"Green or blue dollars, they all spend the same Eh.I do not think any more info was posted here then on Cat-Eye? If so it is most likely because things are still developing, the event is a ways off yet. Can't say I see any big conspiracy involved in that?I would love to see more Canadian anglers fish the event, still baffles me why they do not? Entry fee's is set, we US anglers pay the same as the Canadian anglers, we all get a shot to take some cash home, no biggy Eh. The event is good for the area. We US anglers spread around a good deal of cash when we are up. We have fun, lots of good folks fishing both US and Canadian, fishing is often outstanding in August, win-win for everyone as I see it.Much to-do about nothing really, it all spends the same. Even if you are lucky enough to win, odds are good you spend it in Canada, I know I do.Ed ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson...><sUMo>""Backwater Guiding"""
526592,Guest,2003-01-24 12:53:00,0,"Hey Backwater Eddy If you checked out Cat eye Outfitters website you will see alot less information posted, than on Walleye central. Lets get one thing straight, I have no problem with American anglers coming up here to fish, nor with the US as a whole. It will cost you $300.00 US to enter right. It would cost me $435.00 Canadian to enter, which is equal to $300.00 US at an exchange rate of 45 percent. You get payed in US dollars, I get payed in Canadian dollars. When I went to school some 30 years ago this would mean, I would have to pay $135.00 more than you. Now if I bring my $300,00 Canadian to the states I get a whole $165.00 Us for it. That mean it would cost me $435.00 dollars Canadian to enter this event, if it was held in the states at $300.00 US. You would still be paying only $300.00 dollars. I would be paying $435.00. Remember I get payed in Canadian loonies and you don't take them. The bottomline is that entry fee should have breen posted in Canadian dollars. If this event was held in the states the fee would have been posted in US dollars. Now tell my I wrong.Good fishin The Canadian AnglerLarry"
526593,Backwater Eddy,2003-01-24 14:06:00,3871,"OK, If it makes you feel better Larry, I will pay the entry fee as $435 Canadian, and not $300 US. Then you and I can enter in the event and I will do my dardest to take your Canadian loonies home with me, with pleasure.I still see it as they post a fee, you pay to play. Be it in frog skins, loonies, green backs, Euros, beaver tails, clam shells and bead...or whatever...simple as that. Ed ""Backwater Eddy"" Carlson...><sUMo>""Backwater Guiding"""

Each time these events we're held the majority of perticipants were from the ""States""! Why in the world then, would we confuse these guys by dealing in Canadian Currency! Besides what's the deal, if the entry is in ""U.S. funds"" and you happen to place in the cash, you'll be way ahead of the game.Question(s) for you Larry:Do you fish for cats on the lower stretches of the Red River?Did you happen to participate in any of the three previous catfish tournaments that were held here on the Red?
