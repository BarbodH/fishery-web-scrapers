527403,lunker99,2003-02-07 15:45:00,236,"Another place to get them if you're going up to Goose Bay on Lac Suel and don't want to have to drive past camp and into town that first day is the gas station at Vermillion Bay. The bait shop in Ear Falls (4 Seasons) was a couple of dollars per pound cheaper last year, though."
527392,Otts,2003-02-06 10:10:00,119,"I am heading to Canada two times this summer. The first trip is the second week in June (Goose bay up on the NW) and then again just before July 4th (Frog Rapids on the SE). Leeches seem to be the best bait so far. I usually buy them in Ft. Frances, but I would say they are not the best leeches, many are dead or so small it is hard to tell they are a leech. Have you found any good places to buy bait where you thought the price was fair and the bait was in good shape? Thanks ahead of time,Otts"
527393,Fishing Junky,2003-02-06 10:48:00,182,"Hey Otts. Don't go into Canada anymore, but when I did go, we would get our leeches at Witherspoon's. A lillt gas/convience store in Fort Francis by the Mcdonald's resteraunt. They weren't the best, but they worked ok. Hope this helps. Junky............"
527394,Vitreum,2003-02-06 11:10:00,221,"last july the bait shop in ear falls had pretty nice leeches. i bought a pound and did not lose a single one all week. just kept them in a thermos in the refrigerator and changed the water daily. most were nice size. no jumbos, but nice. think the shop is called four seasons and they were $20 canadian per pound."
527395,IaDave,2003-02-06 11:25:00,476,A couple years ago we stopped in Dryden at a gas station and they were good leeches. We got the directions from the guy at the Beer Store. Sorry can't remember the name of the station.
527396,Guest,2003-02-06 12:04:00,0,we bought our leechesin ear falls at the bait shop and they were as good as any i have ever found they didnt skimp on them either hope this helps Rick
527397,Guest,2003-02-06 12:43:00,0,"Never bought leeches in Canada, alway brought them from the states and hid them really well. Let them try to catch me."
527399,Guest,2003-02-06 13:50:00,0,"Otts,Fish with minnows and maybe you can keep up with the guy in the middle of the boat. Just don't say I can't have any if you start nailing them on leeches."
527400,Guest,2003-02-06 14:52:00,0,"if your going to Frog Rapids there are plenty of places in Sioux Lookout,also Odjibway outfitters is right near buy .Maybe its your first time there so dont worry about beverages ,bait etc all close by...... and for crying out load please dont let me see you drive hundreds of miles only to fish under the bridge @ Frog Rapids ..HAVE FUN.....sorry cant help with GOOSE BAY"
527398,retire55,2003-02-06 15:16:00,1029,"Bigg:I'm just wondering whether Scott will provide your addy in order to properly identify you. I'd personally pay money to watch Immigration Canada send your sorry a** home (if they catch you bringing in live leeches). If you're so intent on breaking our rules before you even get here, do us all a favour, and stay home. Your post does a disservice to all honest american fishermen vacationing in Canada."
527401,Dave,2003-02-07 06:46:00,258,"Otts:I would recommend Four Seasons Sport Shop in Ear Falls. When no one else had leeches in September, we bought six lbs. from Mike & Pam. Along the way I've been told that licensed Canadian bait shops can import leeches from U.S. (mostly Minn.)? I guess that offsets the Canadian crawlers we get here in the states."
