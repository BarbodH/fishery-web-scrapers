My understanding is that this was a special run for you guys up North?? I am located in Montana and have tried twice(unsuccessfully) to buy from a store in Minnesota. I have a standing order in with them and was told on Monday(2/3/03) that they should have their #5 size in this next week and will ship when they do. My confidence is waning with these guys and I just don't want to get hung out to dry again so I want to try to round up some back up sources in case this doesn't come together with the MN store. If anyone has any leads on this particular bait I would appreciate it. I'm looking for 5-6 cranks, a couple of #5's and a couple of #7. Were these made in any other sizes? This is all the MN store offered... Thanks for any help you can provide.. RJ in Montana. Feel free to email me with info if you preffer. [email protected]"
