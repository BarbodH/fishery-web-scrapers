527381,Guest,2003-02-07 14:03:00,0,"This following text in quotes is straight from Labatt Brewery Customer Service. My buddy asked this question, but we still can't believe the reply:""Thank you for your e-mail Marco! We appreciate you taking the time to leave us your comments. There is no difference between the Blue in Canada and the Blue in the US. We actually brew the beer in our Canadian breweries and then ship the product to the US.Cheers!Melanie Labatt Customer Service""No question, there's a difference in taste...it's very distinct. Anyway, it's not in Labatt's best interest from a strategic marketing position to ever admit that the U.S. brew is different in any way to their Canadian product as that would make the U.S. Import just 'a different type of beer'....not truly Labatt. They may brew it up there and ship it here (get's Customer Service off the hook), but it's NOT the same....no way. You gotta love the business of business."
527390,River_eye,2003-02-07 14:33:00,1486,"Blue is possibly my favourite beer, and when American guests bring up blue from the states, it is definately different. It probably has somthing to do with the methods used to preserve beer down in the states. Canadian beer has no presrvatives and will go bad after a few months even if it is kept cold."
527391,Hammerhead Herb,2003-02-07 14:56:00,259,"Speaking of Labatt's:Why is it that Labatt's is sold in 11.5 oz bottles and the other beers are sold in 12 oz bottles? Here in Illinois, I've had to tell some liqour store owners to change their 'price per ounce' label on the Labatts because they made their calculations assuming everything was a 12 oz container."
527379,Jigger1,2003-02-06 09:14:00,234,"Other than price, is there a difference in the Blue you can buy at the Duty Free shop as compared to the Beer Store? For that matter is there a difference in the Blue you can buy at the local liquor or grocery store in the States?I had understood that there was something different in the brewing process for beers sold in the U.S. Any clarification regarding potential ""myth"" would be greatly appreciated."
527380,Guest,2003-02-06 09:54:00,0,"Good question! Blue (or Bleue-Quebec)has been my ""go to"" brew for ages. I've had this debate many times before, and wish someone in the know could answer this question....is the Blue you purchase in Canada different than the Blue you buy here in the States? My opinion, for what it's worth is...ABSOLUTELY...there's a difference, and it tastes better in Canada than here! Is it because it's fresher? Is it because the Canadian Brewers send down the stuff at the bottom of the vat for consumers in the US? Or is it simply made just a tad different between the two countrys? Any Labatts brewmasters out there???"
527382,Guest,2003-02-06 10:57:00,0,"There is no relationship that I have found between the ""Canadian"" beers sold in the US. (ie Blue, Moosehead), other than the packaging, and the same beer bought in Canada. Is it possible the recipe and name is the only thing imported to some secret brewery in the US.? Blue=Miller, Moosehead=Bud? Don't know what variety they peddle at the duty free."
527383,Guest,2003-02-06 11:54:00,0,"My understanding is that the Canadian variety has a higher alcohol content. When I was in college in Buffalo, NY, we used to go across the border all the time to get cases of Canadian beer. Bradour's (spelling?) had the highest alcohol content. 3 or 4 Bradour's seemed like 7-8 of the US beer."
527384,retire55,2003-02-06 12:09:00,1029,"From http://www.beer.com/brands/us/labattblue/beer_blue.htmlA classic pilsener-styled lager, Labatt Blue is the top selling Canadian beer and the #3 imported beer in the U.S. As in Canada, it has an alcohol content of 3.9% by weight or 5.0% by volume, and should be served at 37F (3C)."
527386,red2,2003-02-06 21:39:00,16,"jigger, the blue you buy at the duty free is the same beer you buy at the candian liquour store. Look at the label and it will say 5.0 in alcohol same as the blue in canada. When I go to canada I allways buy one at the duty free store to take in with me and then buy more at the liqour store. Have a great fishing season. Tim"
527385,Guest,2003-02-06 21:41:00,0,I was told that it has to do with the alcohol content in the beer. The regulation on pasteurization in Canada and the US are different and that is the difference in the amount of alcohol.
527387,Guest,2003-02-07 06:51:00,0,"Posts about equal alcohol are right. Almost all large production US lagers (Bud, Miller, etc..) are about 4.9 to 5.0% alcohol which is the same as most large production Canadian lagers (Blue, Molson Canadian, etc..). There's no difference on either side of the border. Also, Brador has 6.2% alcohol so if you drink four of those you get the same alcohol as about five Blues."
527389,Thumper,2003-02-07 09:29:00,133,"I've never purchased anything from the duty free store. After looking around briefly at the one in Ft. Francias to get my lodge tax rebate, it looked like the prices for regular merchandise like gifts, etc. , was very expensive - much more than in the U.S. Am I missing out - is the price for beer lower there?Here's a link y'all may like. The Ontario's beer store has a lot of information on line. It lists all the beer they sell at each store, complete with a description of the beer, it's flavors, aftertaste, etc., plus alchohol content, packaging options (24-350ml cans, etc.) and the cost.http://www.thebeerstore.ca/about/the_beer_store.aspCheers! ;)- Rick ""Thumper"" Torgerud"
527388,Jigger1,2003-02-07 12:06:00,234,Red - The Blue I buy in Illinois also says 5% by volume.
