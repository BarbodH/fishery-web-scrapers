1405099,Shellback,2012-03-10 08:08:00,8083,Are you speaking about Kurtz's? That's where I get mine.
1405116,5richards,2012-03-10 08:53:00,131,yes -- very economical!
1402628,Bigstorm,2012-03-04 10:30:00,799,"I took gulp alive 1 year, to me, it didnt work well at all. Tried the leeches, threw them in the garbage when I got home. I've also tried Trigger X leeches and paddletail minnows, caught a few fish but no where near the amount we caught on salted minnows or live bait"
1403067,@Lunker,2012-03-05 10:25:00,835,"1) Haven't actually crunched the numbers but I'm going to guess it's a lot cheaper for salted minnows than it is for Gulp.2) When I did it, I used to layer minnows in a container with pickling salt (a finer grain). But the drawback to using them was that the constant exposure to salt really, really chewed up the skin on my fingers. Always remember to rinse well after each contact, and you might want to use a high quality skin cream at the end of the day."
1403139,Lovetofish,2012-03-05 13:42:00,458,Salted minnows work to good to use anything else.
1403448,stevensinks,2012-03-06 07:38:00,330,Were do you buy your salted minnows. On the way up last year I decided to get some and could not find them.
1403457,jambi,2012-03-06 07:57:00,504,Just got my Magic catalog in mail yesterday. Used them last year out fished my buddy 3 to 1 when he used a jig only. Didn't take long for him to start adding a preserved minnow. www.magicproducts.com
1403578,Bigstorm,2012-03-06 12:38:00,799,"I just buy live minnows at the local bait shop and make them, I bet that is the cheapest & easiest way to go. You can make them a week or 2 ahead of time and put them in the freezer until you leave on the trip"
1403583,SSH,2012-03-06 13:00:00,526,"Try to find a bait dealer that sells in bulk. I usually buy either a half-gallon or full gallon of fatheads. I use 1/4 cup salt and 1/4 cup sugar in a zip lock bag. Close the bag and shake to mix the salt and sugar. Add 1 & 1/2 cups of fatheads and shake well to mix well. Put them in the freezer and take a bag or two out per day when needed. The sugar seems to reduce the salt's effect on your hands. We have used them jigging and pulling spinner rigs with good success in Ontario. Years ago we tried using live minnows at $5 or $6 a dozen only to have some otters clean them up in one evening. When we used the live minnows, we always seemed to forget to put the minnow bucket back in the water. This resulted in lots of dead minnows. I think the salt acts as an attractant as well as a preservative . I have read of adding garlic, but have not tried it."
1405024,Shellback,2012-03-10 06:00:00,8083,"So are you speaking about good old ""Twenty Mule Team Borax""? I'd like to give it a try and take some to Canada with me in a couple months. For the guys using salt, is it just table salt, or is there a particular salt you need to use?"
1405052,Golden Eagle,2012-03-10 06:53:00,2642,"I use coarse salt and yep, 20 Mule Team Borax. First ran across 20 Mule Team Borax in a commercial on a TV Western series. I believe it was Death Valley Days. Borax preserves your minnows. A touch of garlic powder gives it extra stink."
1405056,5richards,2012-03-10 07:00:00,131,"If memory serves me --- I used the large boxes that were non-iodized as well as the Borax -- search the threads for the percent mixtures -- Shellback -- I got my minnows from a ""fish farm"" not 20 minutes from you -- send me a pm if you want the info -- don't want to appear to be advertising for someone on this site. I'm located in Bucks County."
1402130,wmd,2012-03-03 07:04:00,388,"First is it legal to take salted minnows into Ontario from the US. Second what has been your experience using salted minnows, do they work as well as live bait, do they last longer? How do they keep? I have read one article on how to prepare them, what is your receipe?Thankswmd"
1402153,cuamb,2012-03-03 07:34:00,203,If you search the site you will find a lot of threads on this. I personally have found that Borax soap works better than salt. It doesn't dry them out as much. When I return home from a fishing trip with live minnows I just drain the water and dump them in a zipper bag. Add enough Borax to cover them and add a dash of garlic salt. Then I through them in the freezer.They are legal and seem to work well.
1402160,Bigstorm,2012-03-03 07:40:00,799,"Yes, it is legal to take preserve bait across the border, still alive is illegal. I always let them know when I cross that I do have salted minnows since they usually ask if you have any live bait anyway.I find that salted minnows work just as well as live and will last longer on your jig. When they get all chewed up, I turn them into a minnow ball on the hook and catch fish that way too.As far as making them, my method seems real easy and seems to work just fine, I use quart size freezer bags, dump about inch of salt in the bag, then about 2doz fatheads, then another inch of salt and shake it up. I continue to add layers in the bag and usually get about 10 to 12 doz in the bag with about 3/4lb of salt. I end up taking up 50 to 60 doz salted minnows for each trip"
1402208,pike50plus,2012-03-03 08:59:00,584,"My fatherinlaw(GOd rest inpeace) taught me this for Lake erie shinner minnows, great way to freeze them!"
1402214,Crede,2012-03-03 09:10:00,134,"You will find many differing opinions about the effectiveness of salted minnows. Here's mine, based on my experience taking them on numerous Ontario fly-in trips. I look at them as primarily a ""backup bait"". We take them, but many years do not use them. They have the advantages of not weighing much and requiring no special storage while on a fly-in. Things change with the season, but generally speaking I find live minnows most effective, followed by crawlers or leeches, followed by salted minnows. Therefore, I usually prefer taking live minnows if possible with some nightcrawlers as backup. If July or early-mid August, and keeping live minows alive for the week may be difficult, I take less live minnows, nightcrawlers, and some salted minnows. I have only used the salted minnows significantly on two trips - one where our weight limit precluded live minnows and once where the live minnows all signed a suicide pact the first night. Some will tell you that if you are going to a fly-in lake which requires live bait, you are going to the wrong lake. We are primarily jig fishermen. For whatever reason, it is what we usually do. While on many days I am certain that we would probably do just as well jigging without any live bait - just using Powerbait or Gulp, I consider the live bait as cheap insurance. My group has talked about this a lot and decided that we would really be unhappy if some year we went without any live bait and had a slow week. Given the overall cost of the trip and the logistics of all of us getting time off together, we don't want to take that chance."
1402227,SinOrSwim,2012-03-03 09:55:00,1528,"If you usually fish with live bait and don't take on a fly-in it's like spending the money to go to disneyland and not spending the few extra dollars to ride a ride or take a picture with Mickey. Point being, is why wouldn't you take live bait? It's a nominal expense in relation to the cost of your trip.Agree,take the salted minnows as a back up but no need to be your primary bait if you want to fish with minnows.Also, we have a collapsible minnow bucket. Sort of a mesh material with a velcro closure. When we get there, we put all the minows in this container, put a rock in it and drop it deep in the water. Usually just tied to the dock but the water down there is colder and it keeps all the minnows alive. Much better than the oxygenated containers or in a bucket floating on the water. We always lose a ton of minnows if they float on the water."
1402236,Larry S,2012-03-03 10:37:00,665,"We take worms and leeches,don't mess with live minnows on fly-in trips. We go last week in june or first week in july. Have brought salted minnows,but have found that they are not very effective to catch fish. Between worms,leeches,artifical baits,and lures we have no trouble catching lots of fish"
1402303,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-03-03 14:32:00,235,"I've done a fly in trip for 9 out of the last 12 years. The group I go with has fished for over 25 years up there. Live minnows, leeches and crawlers were the standard for many years. Then someone brought up salted minnows, first as a backup. It soon became clear that salties were at the very least equal with live minnows in terms of productivity, but they were much cheaper and easier to keep. For the past 6 years or so, we no longer bring live minnows, and we have always caught enough fish. We will bring a few leeches for slip bobbering, but that's it. It seems counterintuitive, and It took being out fished by my boat mate a couple times (me using live, he using salted) to accept reality, but apparently it just doesn't take much to fool those ignorant dumb walleyes on remote lakes."
1402323,SteveJ715,2012-03-03 15:15:00,59,"Anybody put these up against Gulp? I've heard guys swear by Gulp also, so I'm curious if it's worth it to make a batch of salties or if they're pretty much the same as Gulp. - Steve"
1402327,5richards,2012-03-03 15:23:00,131,I agree w/ten horse --- they work great and you can get them real cheap [alive] from local bait farms and make your own. They are very durable!
