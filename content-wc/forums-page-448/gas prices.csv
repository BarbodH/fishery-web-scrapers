1403986,Guest,2012-03-07 11:46:00,0,"I don't blame you when you have the entre bill and don't split it with anyone. We split the gas 6 ways and are still thinking of leaving the SUV at home and taking two cars instead,"
1404748,tackleman,2012-03-09 11:12:00,444,"Got gas for my truck today in Red Lake . it was $1.389 a litre, multiply this by 4.5 to get the cost per imperial gallon (this is what we use in Canada, and is a little bigger than the USA gallon)looks like it's going to be a costly summer for boat gas. but what the heck, you only live once."
1404755,Golden Eagle,2012-03-09 11:31:00,2642,And once is enough when we do it right.
1404779,new hips,2012-03-09 12:48:00,498,There is 3.7854118 liters per gallon= $4.914 gallon. Plus currency convert is right now .9896 per US dollar. How's that CHANGE work'in for Ya. I can't imagine how big those battery's will be to pull a boat with a battery powered SUV. I wonder if they will have charging stations in Red Lake ?
1404817,Mohleye,2012-03-09 14:10:00,368,"Although the price has CHANGED it is still lower than it was in summer 2008. We went then, and we'll go this year. As part of the overall cost, divided among the group it's not that significant. It's also pretty hard to put a price tag on all the fun and incredible experiences I've had on my many trips to Canada. It's not cheap, but then I don't think I've ever been on a great vacation anywhere that was."
1405029,NathanH,2012-03-10 06:06:00,697,Gas prices didnt stop my father and I from booking our trip this year. But I could see how one person footing the full bill driving a great distance with a large boat how it could be a deal braker. Our little 25 doesnt burn that much gas but some folks burn 10-12 gallons a day on the lake. That adds up.
1408677,dirka13,2012-03-19 03:57:00,15,"as i look too see a empty gas guage on my readout i see gas ahead at the next stop out of work, $1.32, and i feel sick to my stomach as i believe the rumors of over a $1.50 a liter by summer to be true... and yet my country sits on the second largest oil deposit in the world, sigh, glad im renting a small car for my fishing trip rather than my hemi lol"
1398109,HeHooksHimself,2012-02-23 08:41:00,725,"My guys and I have talked and we have decided not to go to Canada if gas prices reach or go over our agreed upon limit. As of now, our limit is $25/gal. However, we all are confident that hope and change will drive down the prices!"
1398150,Pikehunters,2012-02-23 09:44:00,100,"Spoken like a politican!!Was that $25. for gas, diesel or aviation fuel!!!"
1398246,2746,2012-02-23 13:09:00,3206,"As others have said it likely won't have an affect but......4 years ago gas was $2. The average family that has two cars, or possibly kids and 3 cars, will buy 2000 - 2500 gal. of gas a year. That means they are spending $4000 -$5000 more than they were 4 years ago and at some point that money will have to come from somewhere. It clearly has had an affect on the amount of disposable income. It's one of the more significant challenges to our economy as it affects what we have to spend and.....the price of nearly everything we buy."
1398298,HeHooksHimself,2012-02-23 14:42:00,725,"As I said to my wife just last night- My bucket list contains the following: Make as many trips to Canada fishing as I can. Currently I am getting by with one in the spring and one in the fall. My kids will have to do with a little less in the inheritance if that is what it takes. But I am not speaking for anyone else, if you get my drift."
1403827,The Canuck,2012-03-06 23:47:00,67,"Gas prices as of today March, 7 in Red Lake Ontario CANADA. (at the end of the road) $1.30/liter. Regular.Cheers"
1403867,FrankLeigh,2012-03-07 07:21:00,80,"It is exactly the same price here in southern Ontario. Also, I was in Niagara Falls, New York last weekend and it was over $4 a gallon, less than Ontario prices, but not as big a spread as we used to see.Let's face it. We can't control the price. For a family, it is a major expense, but when you have four guys splitting the cost, it is not the end of the world, and I would not give up a trip because of an extra $50 or $75.Only two months until Walleye opens !!!!"
1403888,milktester7,2012-03-07 07:59:00,2,"I think the problem is the extra spent all year on gas with higher prices, not just the trip to Canada. like someone said above. We are considering leaving the Jeep and boat at home and taking the car which gets twice as good gas mileage, more comfortable, and still will hold all of our fishing gear. We love going to Canada fishing, and now that our son is old enough we hope to do it every year, even if that means cutting back on other things during the year."
1403904,LOW1,2012-03-07 08:33:00,2828,If I remember right I paid more than that two summers ago in the Kenora area.
1403955,LLewellin,2012-03-07 10:39:00,1790,I don't think it will affect the guys that already have their trips planned but for those still considering a trip I think they may tend to stay closer to home. IMHO
1403971,ohiojmj,2012-03-07 11:09:00,1262,"For those wanting to check gas prices: http://ontariogasprices.com/Price_By_County.aspx?c=canFor my usual 1500 mile trip from Akron, Ohio, to a fish camp in Ontario or Quebec, I get a whopping 11 mph pulling my 17' boat so thats 136 gallons plus about 40 gallons to feed the Optimax for a total of 176 gallons. Assuming $1.30/liter times 3.785 l/gal thats $866 for gas, ignoring exchange rate, mastercard rip-off conversion charge, tolls, the tank of gas bought in US. Toss in a $800/week basic cabin plus tax, but not counting the beer and food (would be consumed at home for the most part) and I'm over $1700 for my son and I. Compare this with a roundtrip commute to lake Erie for the day consuming 10 gallons in the SUV and 4 in the boat for a total of 14 gallons or about $56. One trip to Ontario equals 30 trips to Erie. While there is no comparsion in scenery and I really enjoy slaying the pike, I am choosing Lake Erie commutes this year because I have other family expenses to manage this year. Some may suggest that the increase in the cost of the trip to Canada from inflated gas prices is small, but the total cost of a typical Canada trip for many of us has been steadily increasing and not trivial for many in the 99%."
1396930,wallydave,2012-02-20 16:22:00,2151,with the DUI restrictions being lessened the walleye anglers that stayed home can now come along and help with gas!!??
1396971,Pikehunters,2012-02-20 17:27:00,100,Bring on that great AMERICAN CHILI !!
1396976,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-02-20 17:39:00,235,"If only the cost of driving up there is affected, I doubt it will have much of an impact. However, if rising fuel caused outfitters to raise their fees significantly (for boats, flights, shipments etc), then you might see an impact."
1396994,wallydave,2012-02-20 18:05:00,2151,"That kind of ""gas"" our group calls ""muskie barks"" One of my favorite bumps stickers: ""Chili, its not just for breakfast anymore""!"
1397015,ohiojmj,2012-02-20 18:42:00,1262,"Dui fishermen flood the border, news at 11."
1397039,HeHooksHimself,2012-02-20 19:37:00,725,I'll remember that one!
1397245,labsrus,2012-02-21 10:58:00,557,Gas prices will not impact our trips to Canada this year.
1398081,lenray,2012-02-23 07:53:00,467,I am hoping for $ 6.00 gas in October 2012--maybe 7
1398100,Golden Eagle,2012-02-23 08:25:00,2642,Yes!

1396696,Obabikon,2012-02-20 08:43:00,2370,"Depends on how high the gas prices get. I've seen mixed reports, but we've dealt with high gas prices for several years."
1396701,Hot Runr Guy,2012-02-20 08:50:00,16061,"I can't imagine gas prices causing me to cancel my trip. Let's put this into perspective: a 1000 mile roundtrip, in a 15mpg vehicle, consumes 67 gallons of gas. At $3.50 a gallon, that's $233, at $4.50/gal, that's $300. Considering that the vehicle is probably going to have at least 2 guys in it, sharing the cost, I'm not going to cancel my trip for 35 bucks. HRG"
1396714,NARDA 1,2012-02-20 09:24:00,636,I agree.
1396721,jopes,2012-02-20 09:34:00,692,"Last year I spent roughly $100-$150 in fuel a week, This included boat, Truck To and from the lake as well as into town to work 4 days. If it gets too bad I will just toss in a day of OT per month to increase my income."
1396725,JDP,2012-02-20 09:42:00,1457,When you look at the total cost of a tripthe increase in gas prices shouldn't keep toomany people home. IMHO the U.S. economy has had a huge impact in recent years thnough.I really don't think the relaxing of the bordercrossing will mwan much the first year. I believemany folks will wait and see the true impact ofthe changes. I think they will be skeptical.
1396766,dutchboy,2012-02-20 11:35:00,5717,People may adjust there local fishing habits because of the gas prices. Vacations are something that is looked forward to all year. I can't see anybody canceling a trip to Canada.
1396767,dutchboy,2012-02-20 11:37:00,5717,"I should amend my statement.If you are a professional trucker and pay your own fuel and it hits $5.00 a gallon, then yes you may cancel your trip."
1396814,Pikehunters,2012-02-20 13:21:00,100,Doesn't Canada use there own oil to refine into fuel ?
1396895,lcwhit,2012-02-20 15:13:00,104,"gas wont be a major factor to most guys. i think the dui relaxation will help at the margins. the problem is and continues to be that americans are broke, especially young americans. the prices of everything keeps going up down here. fuel, utilities, food, insurance. cant quite understand it though, because our government keeps telling us that inflation is less than 3%. go figure. only thing going down is housing prices, but few can qualify for mortgages and the low interest rates have only helped well healed americans refinance their loans. on the other hand i get squat for interest on my savings. we are really screwed up."
