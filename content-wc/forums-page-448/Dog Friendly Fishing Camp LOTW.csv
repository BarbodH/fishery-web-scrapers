1405948,DewarsH2O,2012-03-12 09:38:00,22,I am looking for a dog friendly fishing camp out of the Nestor Falls / Morson area on Lake of the Woods. Housekeeping cabin. It is pretty hard to put Joe The Wonder Dog into the kennel for 9 days. He see's you hook up the boat and knows what is going on! Thanks for the help.
