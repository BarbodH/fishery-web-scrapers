1407806,gapwedge,2012-03-16 09:31:00,19,"Anyone fish Murray Lake or at any other lodge in the Chapleau area during the summer? Live in Cleveland and looking for the best fishing available east of Superior. Western Ontario is a really long haul. Bass fishing is my fav, but I love eating Walleye."
1403536,DougBlack,2012-03-06 11:04:00,29,"Looking at taking kids up and thinking it would be between these two. I have a boat, but might just rent one of theirs. Looking at numbers to keep them interested more than monsters, but wouldn't be upset to find a couple. Just wondering if anyone has input on which would be best for a 13 and 15 year old, second time up to Canada. Thanks,"

1403542,TIGHTLINER,2012-03-06 11:21:00,223,I never fished either place however i worked wiht a guy that went to praire bee about 10 years in a row always talked good of the place caught lots of small pike. Told me boats motors and cabins were all very good. Never talked about any other fish in the lake. There was a large group that went up from a local church. I am not sure how hard they fished or anything else. Hope this helps.
1403574,adempsey,2012-03-06 12:34:00,963,"Same owners, so I would just inquire and see what's available. I emailed a few weeks back and there wasn't much available in July and August at Happy Day, but Prairie Bee had some openings. This was before all the big fishing shows though.I am sure your boys would have a great time at either place."
1404711,DougBlack,2012-03-09 09:51:00,29,"Thanks for information, we got the outpost camp at Happy Day Lodge booked. Anyone ever spent anytime there or on that end of lake? Fill me in if you have a chance."
1405857,DougBlack,2012-03-12 05:18:00,29,"Bump, wondering if any of you guys have been to the outpost camp at Happy Day and what were your experiences, look forward to hearing from you."
1405899,Golden Eagle,2012-03-12 07:44:00,2642,The camp owner will answer your questions about the outpost. He's a straight shooter.
1405920,DougBlack,2012-03-12 08:32:00,29,"Im just wondering who did what and where at the outpost camp, any must get to places, that type of thing."
1405932,Golden Eagle,2012-03-12 09:00:00,2642,Bob Zimmerman will be your best source of information. Also check with members of the party you replace.
1406212,unclepaully,2012-03-12 18:10:00,112,"Doug,If one of those two don't pan out look at Murray Lake Cottages which not too far from the area your looking at. I just returned from an ice fishing trip up there. Tina & Jeff are great owners and will point you in the right direction. The cottages are very nice and you have the option of fishing Murray lake or going to several other lakes where Jeff keeps a boat & motor. http://www.murraylake.net/contact.html"
