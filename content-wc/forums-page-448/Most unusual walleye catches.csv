1408186,brwhite,2012-03-17 11:40:00,41,Some years ago at Lac Seul one of the group had a large fish on but somehow lost his brand new g loomis rod in the water. Typically we have 2-3 boats each year but don't always stick together. Well this person was so embarrassed that he made his boat partners that day swear they wouldn't say anything. The next day one of the other boats (mine) just happened to pull up a brand new rod. Most of the afternoon my friend was rather excited that he had just improved his inventory of equipment. When we got back to camp the original owner of the rod decided to come clean and after about 15 minutes of convincing he got his rod back. For many trips to come he was constantly reminded to hold on whenever there was a bite. While we tend to fish the same areas its amazing that we were able to find the rod
1402404,pike50plus,2012-03-03 20:22:00,584,"One fall we were perch fishing in 55 ft off Menote east of Cleveland. I was using 6 lb line and 1 oz sinkers with a single #6 gold hook and minnow. We were ponding 10-12 inchers. I hooked up and could not get the fish up for awile and the guys were razzing me the whole time abou being the ""sheephead"" king. Finally near the surface appears a large walleye, 30 1/4 in 9 and 3/4 lbs. The boat owner had taken his net off because he was not trolling for eyes naymore. he took off his Tee shirt and landed the fish also cracking a rib when his side hit the boat edge reaching for my catch. He is my hero!"

1404589,GWC,2012-03-09 05:16:00,1021,"My most unusual catch was last September on Gull Rock Lake. I had a 21 inch walleye hit a bandit 200. A few minutes later, a 44 inch northern hit the same lure. Both were hooked on the bandit 200 at the same time. Both fish were landed using 10 pound test line on a fairly light weight Browning rod."
1407193,fishinnut 3446,2012-03-14 21:00:00,638,was fishing at the wisconsin dells dam by rivers edge from shore. The son and I took the wife and daughter with for walleyes. I let the daughter use an avids I wasn't using at the time. She was done and set it on the bucket with the jig and minnow in the water and just as I was saying you should get that out of the water a big flash. The pole bends falls off and I just grab it before the pole was gone. It was a fairly nice 26 inch northern. She still says that counts as her fish.

Things that I've hooked: Snake, Seagulls, Pelicans, Turltles, Plastic Buckets, Plastic Bags, Hat, Fly-Rod, Anchor, Frogs, Lobster, Blue Crab, Eels, buddies and boats.....My favorite catch was while trolling at one of my favorite spots in So. California. It was a brand new technique I was trying with limited success. Long story short, after a few misses I landed her. Her name is Tina and we've been together for 12 yearsTight Lines All."
1400021,SinOrSwim,2012-02-27 19:15:00,1528,"We were fishing one afternoon and both of us had a crazy tangle. I was driving and just put motor in neutral so we could get stuff figured out. I got mine figured out but guy in front had not yet. I started getting stuff arranged in the back of the boat as we weren't going to fish much longer. I set my rod down and dangled the minnow over the edge while I cleaned up all my stuff and changed the music. I wasn't paying attention at all and the next thing you know we were bumping up against a small island. Oooops! Literally on the shore with rocks. Looked down and we were in about 2 to 3 feet of water. I went to start the motor and BOOM. Walleye. Pulled in about a 20"" walleye. We literally sat in a couple feet of water, would dangle our line with a minnow over the edge of the boat and were pulling in 18 to 23"" walleye left and right. Was like fishing blue gills. It was crazy! And, a lot of fun"

1400187,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-02-28 10:02:00,235,Was once night fishing with a buddy for largemouth on Silver Lake in Southeast WI. We were topwater fishing with SkitterPops. Hooked a walleye that we lost at boatside. It wasn't very big.

1400845,WMT,2012-02-29 12:46:00,9,Ten years ago on Lake St. Joseph while fishing 3 in the boat we had a walleye with a born to lose tattoo on his chest...three jigs all in a row all over the same side drifting...bam...bam...bam. I was the first one and of course I missed mine...the other two both set the hooks and it turned out to be one 17 inch walleye with both their jigs set through the roof of his mouth and my minnow and mister twister tail in his mouth way down...never seen that...my two others...I netted a dead floater on Lac Seul that turned out to be a 5 lbs jack trying to eat a walleye head first....the walt flared his gills and they both died...the walleye;s head and should were decomposing from the stomach acid i guess because the rest of his body was normal...they were still connected...last story...Lake Trout fishing on Lake Nipigon and all boats in the party are petting deer...slow as can be...so one guy put a barn door hinge with a single barbless hook on and 10 minutes later...Whamo! Only fish that whole day...door hinge! WMT
1400947,Jball,2012-02-29 15:24:00,23,not a walleye story but figured I would share anyway.. while fishing a cut in St George Island Florida I had just hooked up a nice 8 lb sea trout on a medium heavy rod with 20lb test when out of nowhere a 85lb goliath grouper swallowed the trout in one gulp. Somehow the trout got stuck almost sideways in the groupers stomach and he couldnt (or wouldnt) spit it out.. I fought the fish for 30 min until finally landing it on shore. After the shock of the whole event we tried to get the trout out of its stomach but it was so far inside the grouper it was impossible.. we ended up cutting the line and letting the grouper go..with the trout.

1401131,bobo4030,2012-02-29 22:16:00,235,"My wife and I were casting cranks on Gladstone Lake, near Niswa, Mn. On one cast, my sinking Rapala sailed about 30 feet before the reel locked up. The mono line stretched, then contracted like a rubber band. I saw the lure coming back towards my face, but only had time to turn my head away. Two barbs of the forward treble buried themselves in my left nostril. I was surprised it was painless. I gave the Rapala a tug, but it wasn't moving. My wife was unaware of what had happened, so in a calm voice I asked her to look at my nose and tell me if the barbs were buried. After a little freaking out, she said they were buried to the curve of the hooks. We returned to the cabin and I asked my Father-in-law for some help removing the lure. He completely lost it. No help. He couldn't even look at me. So, we hopped in the car and drove 18 miles to the ER in Brainerd. I rode in the front passenger seat. At any traffic light we stopped at, I would look at the car next to us and shake my head, rattling the Firetiger Rapala dangling from my nose. Priceless! In the ER, the doctor said he removes about 75 hooks a year. He said i should consider myself lucky that it missed my eyes. The only painful part of the whole episode was the shot of lidocaine in my nose. Youch! Only one drop of blood and saved the lure. I have never fished without eye protection since. That very cheap lesson saved my left eye a few years later. I was in a small boat fishing with two other guys. I was in the middle seat. The guy in the front hit me square in the left lens of my sunglasses as he drew back to cast a Blue Fox spinner. Be safe, Rick"

The partner then reties the line to a second rod in the boat while his partner is hand bombing this fish. Reel the fish in successfully with my partners hook, bait and line attached...........only a 12lb eye!! Ouch it hurt. Sometimes you just can't do anything wrong! Was a great catch to see."
1399627,Hawkfan,2012-02-26 20:35:00,237,"This last fall on Lac Seul I was reeling in a walleye and got caught up in some old line in the lake at some point while trolling. I brought the fish in the boat along with a big mess of line. When I made a couple twists here and there, I noticed something interesting. I looked at it and realized the line on my spinner rig broke, but was so tangled with the line I picked up in the water and my sinker that it all stayed together. So I brought a walleye in the boat on a hook that wasn't actually attached to my line anymore."

Got to the spot and that rod & reel combination was gone.Next day one of the other boats in our group was fishing roughly within a mile of the same area and caught the lost rod and reel while jigging with a Sonar.What are the odds of catching that particular rod and reel and it being caught by one of our own boats?Hey Mike, did you put a little extra in the offering plate when you got home?Pooch"

Turned out to be a loon, tried to follow it for a while, it eventually broke the line, but was still tangled and could not fly. Never could get close enough to do anything, hope it survived. The camp owner said it is very dangerous to bring a loon into the boat, they are big, strong, and every stab wound you get will become infected."

Then realized the second fish was not mine, mine was still in the water. Got mine up (third walleye) and netted it also. My son ended up hooking one walleye and then wrapped a second up in the lindy somehow. Mine was a normal hook up."

1399827,Pooch,2012-02-27 09:45:00,4619,"Two years ago I had a loon take my minnow and spinner. I didn't even now he was in the area. He came up out of the water and threw the (barbless) hook. Sat back down on the water and literally glared at me!I'm not sure who was more shocked, the loon or my wife and me! I'd almost forgotten that little episode.We also catch a lot of old wads of line that were lost to snags. Sometimes a spinner rig. Most are always about ""gone"" to corrosion. Have also caught metal and nylon stringers, but no fish or remains of fish on them.Have also caught another lost jig. Last year caught one through the jig eyelet. That was sort of a long shot.With all the ""stuff"" that we accidentally catch, just how much old fishing gear is actually just laying on the bottom of any given lake. There surely must be a huge amount of lost gear on the bottom of these lakes. Especially the popular areas.Pooch"
1399937,drlee,2012-02-27 15:11:00,409,"Last year one of our group had a brand new rod and reel. We hid it and presented him with a Barbie rod and reel. We told him he had to catch one walleye at least 18"" before we would be able to locate his new rod and reel. The first day he caught 3 walleyes over 18"" on the Barbie pole...we surrendered his new rig to him immediately. Another day, my son hooked a seagull...long cast, bird swooped down and took it out of mid air. We got the gull into the boat, folded down its wings, removed the hook and let it fly away with no apparent damage. Other son broke off on a northern when fishing with a dare devil...he proceeded to cast and cast, finally hooked the northern again, took out both lures and released the pike. Hooked and landed an old rod/reel. No one in sight, so we motored back to our fishing partners and started to fish. Pretended to hook into a good one, then ""lost"" the fish; swore profusely and threw the old rod and reel into the lake next to their boat. Good laugh. I love Canada."
1399461,5 of Diamonds,2012-02-26 14:59:00,151,"With the days getting longer, the anticipation and exictement of our upcoming Canadian fly-in trips occupy more of my thoughts. One of my most memorable fly-in experiences was last July when I introduced a young angler on his first fly-in trip to buzzbaits. We happened to be fishing in some small rapids on Lac Evans in Quebec. He was using a double prop buzzbait and landed a Walleye. Yes, on topwater. Fishing right next to him using a single prop buzzer myself, I won't forget him hollering over to his Dad w/ what he had just done. After all the laughing, high 5's, pictures and a successful release, this is probably the most unusual Walleye catch I've seen. Would love to hear other's most unusual Walleye catches if you'd care to share."

I told him nobody mounts a 25 incher, you need one over 30 for that. It just so happens he snapped it on the stringer with tow other keepers but forgot to clip it onto the boat. We jigged for it all afternoon but never could hook it.Nah, i was just kidding. Actually we were fishing Hawk Lake, a small lake and needed three on our last day to pack out. We had the perfect ones, 17-18 inches and decided to fish for lakers the rest of the day. We pulled up over the laker spot and I threw out the stringer with the three perfect walleyes and watched it sink as the knot had come loose from the boat on the trip over. Instead of laker fishing we spent the last hour trying to catch three more even though the bite had slowed a little. Had to settle for three 14 inchers. I'm still not sure if we were in violation of the possession limit!"
