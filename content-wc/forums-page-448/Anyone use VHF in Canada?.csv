1403874,Bakie,2012-03-07 07:37:00,22,The rules might have changed but you don't need a license to have the radio VHF in your boat but they say you need a license to use it. As long as you aren't swearing on the radio they won't bother you. As far as I'm concerned a VHF radio should be part of your safety equipment & you shouldn't need a license to use it. Most people here in the Western Basin of Lake Erie don't have licenses and have never been bothered.

1405328,stjoeguy,2012-03-10 18:21:00,979,"Here is my understanding for US residents: Operating in the US: VHF, no license required; GMRS, license required, $85 for 5 years. It's an online application. Operating in Canada: VHF, no ship license required, but operators must have a license called ROC(M); GMRS, no license required for up to 2 watts, over 2 watts is illegal. The VHF license appears to require an on-site test at scheduled locations throughout Canada. I haven't seen anything about online testing. So, a VHF license would be required on Lac Seul, but I don't know how much it is enforced. Anyone have any experience with enforcement?"
