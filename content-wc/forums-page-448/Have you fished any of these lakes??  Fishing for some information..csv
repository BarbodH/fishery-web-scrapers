1397482,adempsey,2012-02-21 19:51:00,963,"Was wondering about the fishing on a few lakes near Hornepayne, Ontario. Searching didn't come up with too much information.Granite Hill LakeObakamiga (Buck) LakeBig Skunk LakeAlso was curious about the impact of weather on Lake Nagagami. I know it's a good fishery, but am concerned about being blown off the lake. It's a very round water body and doesn't seem to have many sheltered bays or islands.Thanks!"
1397545,Mike Borger,2012-02-22 03:50:00,1554,I'm very interested in the first two as well. Would love to hear more myself.Big Skunk Lake? I don't think so LOL!
1398156,adempsey,2012-02-23 10:01:00,963,"Lol, that never even occurred to me. Well, I decided to hit Nagagami this year. I've been wanting to go to Nagagami for a while now, especially considering all the great reviews I have read over the years. Granite Hill and Obakamiga really look like great lakes though and would love to spend some time on them."

1398601,Redear,2012-02-24 09:45:00,40,"Have fished Nagagami the last 2 yrs,there are places to fish on windy days but not always were the fish are biting LOL the lake is 13,251 acres and 33 miles of shorline,has 3 rivers so thats 3 bays to fish in on windy days .If you go in June most all the fishing is in these bays but might have trouble getting reservations this late.We go in July and fish out in the lake mosty it does get white caps 2ft waves on bad days.Lake is mosty sand bottom not many snags like other cadain lakes.The outtfiters all use 16 ft boats and 20hp motors at Expeditions North they include depth finders lund boats and all safety gear,nets so you don't have to fly in your own.We hit the mayfly hatch last year 4th of july week and didn't do as good as the yr before .read the posts on this lake to get more info.Ps Nagagani Lodge uses the ceder boats if that maters to ya.Fred"
1398754,adempsey,2012-02-24 15:06:00,963,"Thanks for the note on Buck WW. Definitely a lake on my ""to visit"" list. Thanks Fred. I enjoyed reading all of your previous reports on Nagagami. Guess we have little choice with respect to the weather. I am a bit of a wimp and don't usually go out on any main water basin if the winds are >20 km/hr (13 mph or 11 knots). We did end up booking with Expeditions North for the first week of July. I am hopeful the mayfly hatch will be earlier this year given the mild winter we're having. If not, I hope the whitefish are active!Thanks!"
1405125,wingrider,2012-03-10 09:05:00,4,"Can't give any advice on Nagagami, but can tell you that I have fished Granitehill and Buck lakes for years with great success. They are connected by a short river, so you can stay at either and fish both. We always stay at Granitehill resort on the american plan, and are well taken care of. Well detailed maps of both lakes are provided at check-in and camp personnel are more than happy to give you advice and put you on the fish if it's your first trip. Can highly recommend this trip. Bob"
1405159,TIGHTLINER,2012-03-10 10:38:00,223,I GOT A EMAIL FROM THE NEW OWNERS OF THE OLD OLIVER'S /sp/ HE IS OPENING UP THIS YEAR YOU CAN EMAIL HIM AT [email protected] . I AM NOT SURE HOW HE GOT MY EMAIL ADDRESS AND I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HIS LAKES HOWEVER I DO REMEMBER OLIVER'S WAS ONCE THE PLACE TO GO AROUND HORNPAYNE. IF THESE LAKES HAVE NOT BEEN FISHED FOR 5 TO 8 YEARS THEY MIGHT BE WORTH LOOKING INTO.
1405828,adempsey,2012-03-11 22:50:00,963,Are you referring to Linbarr Lake Adventures? I actually did run across that during my searches. I was under the impression it was an outpost cabin? It's definitely bookmarked for future consideration =) Just not for this trip since my father isn't really up for an outpost trip.Thanks for the heads up though.
