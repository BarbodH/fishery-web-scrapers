1393949,Gunner_Fletch,2012-02-13 18:14:00,74,What I mean by central is just north of Whitefish Bay/Sioux Narrows and south of Kenora. We are all Canadian...thus residents.

1394293,aggie kolisnik,2012-02-14 12:24:00,39,the beach at the south east end of shamis is not quiet. Some people I know are always staying there and pull their houseboat up for weekends and sometimes a full week at a time all summer long. lots of traffic. There are some beaches after the tug channel past us(Bell Island Outpost) on the way to Morson that are really quiet and beautiful as well.

So my son and I left on Fathers Day, drove from Cen Il to Ear Falls in one day, and tent amped at Goose Bay Camp. We had some windy storm days but we still had a good trip. I am working with an Vet from Afganistan, from our Church. I would love to take him to Canada one. We will see how this goes!"
