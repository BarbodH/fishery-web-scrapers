The outpost actually burned down last year. We talked to some other fisherman at the airbase last year who told us about a lake they fished in years past which had heavy fire damage. They claimed the fishing was pretty dead. I don't take one group's anecdotal account as valid proof, but it made me wonder. Our outfitter sent us an MNR biologist quote saying that forest fires have virtually no effect on the fishery. I remain confident, but was just wondering if anyone else hasnhad experience with this."
1405016,Juls,2012-03-10 05:42:00,13414,"The only way I could think that a forest fire would have any impact on a lake is if there were huge rains afterwards that put a lot of ash and other impurities in the water through run off. But, even then I would have a hard time believing it hurt the fishery to the point it was ""dead"" since where you're going they are not farming and using phosphorous fertilizers. Otherwise, there is no reason that a fire would have any impact in/on the lake at all. Smoke rises and fires goes out when it hits water... just my .02 cents... Juls"
1405019,wallydave,2012-03-10 05:50:00,2151,"If the lake has not seen any fishing with the loss of a cabin or two. An argument could be made that there has not been any fishing pressure since the fire. The fishing could be better than before the fire. From some of my surfing, outfitters will lwt a lake ""rest"" for a season or two. Gives us a report when you get back, then we will know for sure!"
1405381,michigan walleye guy,2012-03-10 20:20:00,95,My group had some anxious moments last summer watching (online) the forest fire almost destroy the brand new beach cabin at Larus Lake. I'm so thankful they were able to save that cabin. 2 1/2 months until we're back at Larus.....can't wait!!
1406141,Gibson,2012-03-12 16:03:00,17,We had our Moose territory burn to the ground 2 years back and that area had the best Walleye fishing I know of. Virtually no bait required-they'd hit a bald jig. It hasn't changed.....
