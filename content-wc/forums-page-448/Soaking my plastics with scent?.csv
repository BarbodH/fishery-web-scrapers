1405625,maddogg,2012-03-11 14:46:00,178,"Hey kansasity,How did your bait soaking turn out? I've been thinking of trying the same thing with Trigger x."
1406477,Babamel2,2012-03-13 10:32:00,414,I am trying an experiment by putting some plastics into juice from pickled herring. I put them in plastic bag with the juice and into the freezer.

1312956,kansasity,2011-05-31 09:17:00,80,Does anyone use scent to soak there plastics in before going to Canada? I've decided to try it. I used a product called Kick-N-Walleye and vac-sealed them. Curious to see if anyone else has ever done this and is it legal in Canada?
1313028,phishfearme,2011-05-31 12:00:00,1242,"i think if you plan to verticle jig a lot this may help as the scent will stay in the vacinity of the bait - but for casting or trolling this will probably have minimal impact - the ACTION of the twister or other plastics is THE most important thing - way more important than color or scent. we now will expect a full detailed report, peer reviewed and with no alcohol involved. phish"
1313064,kansasity,2011-05-31 13:14:00,80,"Will give a full report when we get home. They are already soaking for our end of August trip. I figured the longer the better. Almost all jigging is all we will be doing. Oh ya, and a few coldies as well."
1313121,Jack77,2011-05-31 15:00:00,168,"Soaking other soft plastics in Gulp Alive doesn't work well, they tend to break down over a period of a couple of days. I am not sure that other liquid scents would do the same or what type of soft plastic you are using but you may want to check on them after a few days."
1313388,kansasity,2011-06-01 08:15:00,80,"I've tried gulp alive and have so unimpressed it's unreal. Wouldn't waste my time or money on that stuff. I am using something call Kick-n-Bass, and Kick-n-Walleye. I've read alot about it and everyone has good reviews on it. I'm just trying a few to see if the plastics do break down or not."
1313791,chico,2011-06-02 07:26:00,506,"Have not tried as of yet but have been pondering the idea,would like to hear the results.If you are fishing here in Canada make sure you are fishing in water that does not have a bait ban in effect as for scented plastics are considered live bait.Good Luck hope this helps."
1313837,Lovetofish,2011-06-02 08:40:00,458,Keep your colors seperate or they will bleed together.
1332512,kansasity,2011-07-21 15:27:00,80,"I have been soaking my plastics for about a month and a half now, so far so good. No breaking down, separated them so they did not bleed together. Down to 41 days to go and man do they smell and look good! I'm very excited to see how this works or if the three other boats will have any different luck than us. Just a little experiment I decided to try. I will post a full report and pics when we get home."
1332577,Golden Eagle,2011-07-21 17:58:00,2642,Stay upwind to the fish and they'll find you.
1332776,3M TA3,2011-07-22 10:46:00,2846,I've been using left over Gulp Alive juice and have fairly good success with it. I just drink it the day before I go fishing and when needed the next day it is readily available. Catching more suckers than normal with it.
