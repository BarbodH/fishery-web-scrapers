First of all, you can use live leeches to fish in Quebec and in Zone 13 West. Secondly, you're allowed to transport them from Ontario to Quebec. However, the leeches aren't bait-fish, so you can purchase and transport them without any problems.Anne-Marie RoyCentre d'information sur l'environnement, la faune et les parcs675 boul.

518857,Guest,2002-04-07 19:40:00,0,"Thanks for the correct information. 2 years ago we fished at Watson Lake and when we stopped at a bait store along the way, this was what we were told then-leeches are illegal in Quebec.We didn!t pursue it any further but it could well have been that this dealer did not handle leeches as he tried to sell us overpriced worms but we had brought our own.I just came back from a weekend in Ontario and at Canadian Customs I asked the agent if leeches were still illegal to transport into Canada and he said they are Not to be brought in.Worms in artificial bedding is OK.I just e mailed the lodge in Quebec ( Lake Ogascanan) asking them if they sell leeches. If not I will buy them in Ontario. Good fishing to all."
518858,Guest,2002-04-08 17:45:00,0,"RETIRE55- I just got an e mail back from Ginny at Lake Ogascanan, Que and she couldnt find anything in the current regulation booklet so she called another outfitter in the same ZEC and YES you are all correct in saying that leeches are legal. She does not sell them but some bait stores do carry them."

You can fish with the bait net and the trap fish, but they must be dead when you fish with them and they also must be dead when you travel with them. Your second question, you can use leaches from the US, it's legal. If you need more answers to your questions, please contact me by E-Mail. Thank you and have a nice day!

Am I reading the regulations correct that only dead baitfish can be used while another regulation says one dip net and up to 3 bait traps per license holder may be used in these zones. If only dead bait fish may be used I take it we must allow any caught with a dip net or trap must be allowed to die before fishing with them. Additionally, while leeches are permitted, may they be brought in from the US or must they be purchased in Canada? Expéditeur : Dennis McManus"
1406533,Guest,2012-03-13 13:17:00,0,with respest to proposed rules on live bait they are warrented but allowing divers to go down in anyQuebec waters and kill bass at will and be on the same level as sportsfisherman is abig NO see utube spearfishing bass lac st francois THe fish dont have a chance and once speared by shark gun they cannot be returned to the water always the largest are targetted so who put these guys on the same field as sportsfisherman for the sake of fairness and fair play I urge all true sportsfisherman and clubs to protest thiis lousey form of fishing no matter what secter especially for bass they have enough to contend with as it is
1406597,Mike Borger,2012-03-13 15:55:00,1554,You'll probably get more support if you start a new thread.Dredging up a 10 year old thread that has nothing to do with your cause won't help your case.
1406603,octanehi5,2012-03-13 16:12:00,1104,"like thunderstick said you can bring in as many night crawlers as you want but they have to be in worm bedding not dirt. as for other live bait leeches are very good and easy to get or catch, in many places minnows are not allowed. as for hooking a leech,us a jig head and hook the leech in either end of body once thats it."
518845,Guest,2002-04-02 07:49:00,0,I was wondering if it was legal to bring any types of living bait into Quebec for fishing and if so how much? thanks!!
518846,stewart,2002-04-02 08:39:00,100,I know live minnows are not allowed in many zones.
518847,bigfish1965,2002-04-02 21:57:00,3210,Gonna go out on a limb here and guess that anything other than worms would not be legal. Buy them locally anyway...it's fresher and helps the locals.
518848,Guest,2002-04-03 03:41:00,0,"Live minnows are taboo in most zones. As for worms...they may be used, however if you are planning to transport them across the border, they must be done so in a commercial type bedding (no dirt). As far as quantity...that does not appear to be an issue (who's gonna count 'em?). Good luck."
518849,Guest,2002-04-03 20:59:00,0,"you may want to consider leaches,they work great."
518850,Guest,2002-04-04 21:03:00,0,"Leeches are considered live bait and they are NOT allowed to be used in Quebec.Worms are the only legal livebait allowed. DEAD salted minnows have worked well for us in the past as have the Manns artificial leeches on a jighead. We were told by a ZEC officer that if they stop your boat and you have a minnow net or trap onboard it will be confiscated and you will be issued a summons. Seeing I don!t want to give the frenchmen any more US bucks than I have to, we leave the afore mentioned stuff home.Good luck"
518851,Seanik,2002-04-05 09:08:00,218,"PeteThe lodge I booked out of Senneterre, Quebec sells and recommends leeches. I believe you can buy leeches in Quebec but not import them, also the various zones have different rules. This will be my first time using leeches, How do you rig ? I am thinking jigs/leeches, sinker with what size and type hooks and leader length. Any advice will be appreciated."
518852,Guest,2002-04-05 10:18:00,0,Hi Seanik - What lodge in Senneterre are you going to??
518855,Guest,2002-04-05 11:49:00,0,"Fact- leeches are permitted in zones 13 and 14 in Quebec. I have fished several lakes in these zones for several years. Many tackle and bait shops in these zones sell leeches for bait, although they tend to be small in size. When you purchase your fishing license in the zone you plan to fish, just ask questions and take the free copy of the fishing regs. available. The people I encounter in Quebec are very helpful and hospitable."
518853,Seanik,2002-04-05 16:15:00,218,"PaulWe are going to Berthelot Lake Lodge. We talked to them at length at the Hamburgh, NY sport show was impressed and booked immediately. This will be the first trip to Quebec in over 20 yrs, we had some bad experiences in the past. Our second choice was Hearst Air but we opted for meals and hot showers. e-mail [email protected]"
