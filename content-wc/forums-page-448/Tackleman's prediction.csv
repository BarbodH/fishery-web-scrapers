1404327,Golden Eagle,2012-03-08 14:24:00,2642,With water levels so low this might be the year ice freezes all the way to the bottom of the lake. Walleyes could be in trouble with crowded conditions.
1404376,wallydave,2012-03-08 16:27:00,2151,The average ice out for the NW end of Lac Seul is May 5th. Just sayin..!
1404378,The Canuck,2012-03-08 16:33:00,67,Last year the ice was out in the second week in May here in Red Lake.
1404563,tackleman,2012-03-08 23:32:00,444,"on another post i figured it might be early , maybe last week of April, but i just checked my records for last year and it was off gullrock , may 7,that being said, last year had some very cold weather and this year has had above average temps for almost all winter. infact, the weather guy is calling for +10 this weekend for 2 or 3 days. some one in red lake posted there was only 2 feet of ice so the normal 4 feet is already 1/2 gone.As far as low water, we have had lots of snow and the run off should raise the water levels back to normal before the season starts. (if the mnr leaves the logs in the dam at snowshoe falls)"
1404700,Moondog,2012-03-09 09:17:00,362,"Thanks, Tackleman!!! I was worried there for awhile thinking you hadn't gotten enuf snow to bring the water levels back up. Mary is leaving LaLa Land (as she calls it) on April 9th and heading home so plan on a big snow storm!!! Only 71 days until the opener......plan to get to Mary's a few days before.......Come over for a beer!"
