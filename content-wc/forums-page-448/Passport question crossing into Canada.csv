1406453,stjoeguy,2012-03-13 09:37:00,979,I don't think it should be a problem. My passport doesn't have an address on it. Just Nationality: United States of America and Place of Birth: Minnesota.

1406530,NathanH,2012-03-13 13:15:00,697,You will have no issue. The passport doesnt require one to renew after a change of address even if you change States. It has no information about your current address as the other posters have stated. If it make you feel better I have been all over Europe with a passport issued in a diffrent state then I was currently living. No issues.
