1404907,ranger22,2012-03-09 17:53:00,124,What part of the river do most people fish? Where are the big eyes caught? Anybody know
1405162,ManitouBass,2012-03-10 11:02:00,201,There are quite a few areas. Most of the crowds will be near LOTW area. It's really good in the Long Sault and Manitou area as well though. Lots of big eyes in the river come spring!
1405305,ranger22,2012-03-10 17:36:00,124,do they fish near wheelers point? or further up.
1405810,ManitouBass,2012-03-11 21:28:00,201,"In all honesty I'm not too sure? I don't have any experience up that way. I'd call wigwam to look for more info. If you think you'll be coming closer to my area (east), let me know."
1406574,gowrlop,2012-03-13 15:03:00,109,"Manitou, is the river open up to or past the Manitou yet?ThanksRoger"
1406586,ManitouBass,2012-03-13 15:36:00,201,It's open from Rainy lake way past Manitou. Ice is gonzo man. Only place I could see having any ice left might be 4 mile bay right at the mouth of LOTW
1406616,ranger22,2012-03-13 16:56:00,124,Nice. Anybody know how the fishing is at the mouth of the river and lake of the woods is?
1406620,ManitouBass,2012-03-13 17:12:00,201,"either call Wigwam or youtube wigwamfisherman for a updated report. He does alot of reports, I gotta imagine he's knows whats up. *UPDATE Went for a walk to the river to take a few pics and there are two boats out fishing. I know Barwick launch still has some ice, so I'm thinking they launched in Baudette"
1406641,gowrlop,2012-03-13 18:08:00,109,Manitou thanks for your reply. I'm 450 miles from there so I enjoy your reports. I did talk to a guy Sunday that ice fished in front of the ramp at Birchdale. He said still a couple feet of ice but I know how fast it goes this time of the year. Haven't seen any pics of open water at Birchdale but I'm sure we will soon. Once again thanks for your reply.
