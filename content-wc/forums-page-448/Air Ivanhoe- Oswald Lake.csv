Does anyone have anything different to say?Also Oswald lake, How was the fishing? Did you find quality size walleye and pike? How about numbers? Was there any outside fishing pressure from locals? Ice fishing etc?Any and all information appreciated. Personal feelings are most welcome. I would like to know all I can before booking a trip. If you would prefer to email me please do so.[email protected]"
1401177,Kwags,2012-03-01 06:23:00,48,"Ivanhoe does a good job, in my opinion. Some of their lakes have cabins with running water and hot showers. Oswald I would have some concern with, though. If you Google ""ONTORA"", there was a big fuss up there last year about rights to fish lakes, and Oswald was at the center of it."
1401456,Pikehunters,2012-03-01 16:54:00,100,I fished with Ivanhoe in 2010 lincoln & 2011 Bromley. Top notch outfit George & Joel are fantastic hosts. I have to agree with kwags oswald was critical part of debate & one of the reasons for shutting down there forum. If you call George he will put you in contact with people that have fished lakes you are intersted in via e-mail. I have had many groups inquire this year about the lakes I've fished & I'm sure you can gather info from there.

1404736,labsrus,2012-03-09 10:43:00,557,"Our group has gone with them a few times, Rush Lake and Bromely. We have had good expereince with them. Plan to go agian next year with them. I wondered what happened to the message board, that was a good place to get recent information regarding the conditions."
1405042,Pikehunters,2012-03-10 06:41:00,100,How did you do on Bromley?
1406818,Mikep007,2012-03-14 07:24:00,77,"Two of us were on Beattie in 2006 with Air Ivanhoe and Oswald was available to us with a short walk-in. At that time, the cabin on Oswald wasn't completely ready and still being repaired/updated. We traveled to Oswald twice and caught decent numbers of pike / walleye. Can't comment on the controversy but can tell you that we didn't see anyone else on either Beattie or Oswald at the time, except for the AI folks working on the Oswald cabin. Both lakes are relatively small with good numbers of average sized pike and walleye. No walleye over 20"" but plenty of them. Biggest pike was 28""."
1406911,labsrus,2012-03-14 10:15:00,557,"Bromley has a nice cabin. Lake itself is shallow and stained, lots of weeds. We went in July, good walleye caught in lake and we needed to run into the river to find larger Pike. Caught a rather nice walleye on a top water bait, suprised us in the boat at the time."
1408390,Pikehunters,2012-03-18 07:18:00,100,Cabin had everything almost to nice for the bush. We where there in aug. lake was choked had trouble getting to the rivers but that was the only place to fish did well on numbers but nothing for size.
