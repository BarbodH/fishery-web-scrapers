1308187,teddi,2011-05-17 15:45:00,349,Not for sale. Every thing is still good.
1308618,Hawkfan,2011-05-18 13:48:00,237,They still had a booth at the All Canada Show. I can't imagine they would go through that travel if they were selling.

1409152,Pinetree,2012-03-20 07:57:00,5,You might want to give Uchi a try. The fishing is tremendous thanks to the owner's conservation policies. The owners really care about their guests and tend to every detail imaginable.
