1404679,dogrodder,2012-03-09 08:47:00,400,I am needing to renew my Ontario Outdoors Card and am planning a May opener trip. Can anybody tell me what their experience has been regarding delivery time? Perhaps I'm being a little over cautious but I don't want to get stuck waiting for a card to show up in the mail.
1404680,Larry S,2012-03-09 08:53:00,665,"If you have a printer you can print a copy of it right away,then the card is mailed to you. It took about 3 1/2 weeks to get my card. When you renew your license online you print the license for your copy. No license is sent to you in the mail The printed copy is your license for the year"
1404683,Larry S,2012-03-09 08:56:00,665,"I should have also said that once you print the outdoors card from online,even if you don't get the physical card ,your all set for your fishing trip, because you have the printed copy of your card"
1404690,Lazy Fisherman,2012-03-09 09:04:00,276,Took about 3 - 4 weeks to get the plastic card after I ordered it online.
1404692,Mark R,2012-03-09 09:06:00,1538,Can you simply buy a new one at the time you buy your license or are you required to renew the current one?
1404703,Sanderv,2012-03-09 09:28:00,63,"Yes you can get one when you get your license, but getting one now saves time at the outfitters where things can get hectic.Mine took about a month to get here, after ordering online."
1404759,jkonop,2012-03-09 11:37:00,544,"My card renewal took about 2-3 weeks to arrive. My wife lost here card, adn I wanted to renew it, I sent them an email with here information, they answered my questions, the 1st time around, but there was no response for 7-10 days."
1405091,SSH,2012-03-10 07:54:00,526,"With the advent of purchasing Outdoors Cards and licenses on-line, I believe some of the outfitters will not longer be issuing cards/licenses. I would check with the outfitter/bait store you frequent to make sure they will still be selling cards/licenses."
1406628,mrpike57,2012-03-13 17:39:00,97,"You can renew your outdoor sports card and license by calling 800 667 1940. license comes in mail fairly quickly, card takes longer but if you have the license it is proof you have a valid card. (I think)"
1406857,Larry S,2012-03-14 08:32:00,665,"Go to the online site,renew and you get your license printed immediatly,also a copy of your outdoor card. Your plastic outdoor card will be sent to you in 3 or 4 weeks. When you print the license this is your only copy and is your copy to take on your fishing trip to Canada. You can save your license into your computer to make extra copies,or just make several copies when you make your first copy!"
