1400903,Mike Kansas,2012-02-29 14:29:00,1463,"Thanks to all who have ordered from us. We have been very busy the last month. I want to apologize for the delay in getting the orders shipped . There have been a lot of Crankbaits ordered (over 800) and has I have said before it takes eight days to put the four extra coats of clear coat on in order to minimize chipping. I should have all the current orders shipped by the end of this week. Best Regards, Mike Kansas"
1404918,NathanH,2012-03-09 18:19:00,697,"Just received my order today. Top Notch products. Great color on the Jigs, and lazer sharp hooks. You can tell that extra clear coats were put on the cranks along with good sized and sharp treble hooks. Its going to be hard to share this stuff with my fishing pals. I suspect the fish will be sore this year."
1405433,wallydave,2012-03-11 05:35:00,2151,"Thanks Mike, my jigs arrived yesterday! In 97 days I will be ablle to get them wet! Part of the fun of fishing for me is to try some new presentations each trip! The pink sample jigs look very good! pink and gold were the hot colors for me last year!"
1405972,Mike Kansas,2012-03-12 10:29:00,1463,"Nathan & Dave, Thanks for the kind words. Hope you guys have a great season and catch a bunch of fish. Mike Kansas"
1397240,fishincrazy,2012-02-21 10:48:00,1282,If you had to recommend a sirmanski for someone who likes to troll Hot N Tots on 6lb braid what would you recommend?We have had the best luck for eye's with crawfish colors.I like all of your plugs!Oh yea suspending stick baits as well for both eye's and smallies?Usually like the husky jerk and x-rap for this kind of action.Also like the yourzi crystal minnow.Ghost and olive colors seem to have worked in the past.FC
1397259,Mike Kansas,2012-02-21 11:37:00,1463,"Tough question but I'm thinking that our Shadski or our Diveski would be a good fit. As far as the suspending stickbaits our Ripski is a good stick bait but it is not a suspension lure. Hope this helps you. Good Luck, Mike Kansas (Sirmanski)"
1397270,Pikehunters,2012-02-21 11:51:00,100,curiosity has got me where does the ski come from!!Not that it's a Polish thing but typically it is no offense just curious.
1397272,Mike Kansas,2012-02-21 12:01:00,1463,"In my earlier days has a ball player my nick name was ""The Great Sirmanski"" it had very little to do with skill level it was more just a nick name. Any how the guy who hung it on me passed away a year before we started our business and the name is my tribute to a great friend who gave me the Sirmanski name and many hours of friendship. Mike Kansas"
1397278,fishincrazy,2012-02-21 12:15:00,1282,Thanks Mike I will look into these plugs!FC
1397284,Pikehunters,2012-02-21 12:28:00,100,"Very nice way to remember a great past. I'll be bringing up your site @ our next meeting & see if we can put an order together, Thanks again."
1397313,Mike Kansas,2012-02-21 14:10:00,1463,"Thanks for your kind comments. Hope we can be of service to you. Just a note we have been very busy and I'm about two weeks out on orders. The main reason is that all of the cranks we sell I put an additional four coats of clear coat on before I ship them and that takes about 8 days with the drying process. Best Regards, Mike Kansas"
1397669,NathanH,2012-02-22 09:09:00,697,I just put my small order in. Looking forward to the jigs and Crankbaits. What sold me is when you hear somone is taking the time to put 4 extra clear coats on their lures. You know that its quality no one seems to take that time anymore. Nothing worse then fishing these plastic cranks and having the paint come off after the first few fish. looking forward to seeing the items up close and hope its just the first of many orders.
1398059,Mike Kansas,2012-02-23 06:47:00,1463,"Nathan, Thanks for your kind comments. I hope your order meets your expectations. Mike Kansas"

1395532,wallydave,2012-02-17 04:59:00,2151,"I tried some of there jigs last year, the pink and silver worked the best last June while fishing the NW end of Lac Seul. I had a shad-ski in the tackle box, but never got it wet! We will be hitting the water a little later this year, so I will be able troll and cast the shad-ski!"
1395861,SteveJ715,2012-02-17 19:32:00,59,I'm planning to order a batch of these. My Dad and I like trolling for big walleyes (or aggressive smaller ones.) Has anybody tried using them for northers or lake trout? They look like they have some patterns that each species would find hard to resist.- Steve
1395928,walleyerichard,2012-02-18 05:30:00,23,The lures and jigs are great! The business owner is suspect.
1395976,Bluff,2012-02-18 07:42:00,152,I have ordered lures and jigs from Mike without any problems at all. He was a big help. Suspect?
1396053,Glenman12,2012-02-18 11:11:00,762,I ordered jigs from him last year..not only did I get exactly what I ordered in a timely manner but he threw in a few extra jigs and a crankbait..
1396258,Mike Kansas,2012-02-19 06:14:00,1463,"Richard, It seems like you remember all the times that I fished with you and whipped your can. You are a great guy Richard and when it comes to fishing you are great at running the boat but not so good at catching fish. Hope all is well with you and yours and I'm thinking of sending you back your Snoopy Pole and your Donald Duck Bobbers you left in my trunk. Hope to see you soon Buddy. Mike Kansas (Sirmanski)"
1397069,jheimsch,2012-02-20 20:28:00,38,"I just opened my first order of Sirmanski lures. They look great!!!!! Plan to fish them as soon as the ice is out --we have a trip to Lac Seul next summer. Mike gave me several tips on Lac Seul and also suggestions on how to fish the lures. ""Suspect"" I did find Mike a little suspect. I ""suspect"" he is a real nice guy. He was easy to deal with--quick to respond. He also has great looking jigs besides his crankbaits. Reasonably priced. John"
1397128,NathanH,2012-02-21 05:51:00,697,Thinking about an order has anyone used the WOOBLESKI? Itsis an intresting looking bait. anyone know the weight of the lure as well?
1397201,Mike Kansas,2012-02-21 09:18:00,1463,"Nathan, The Woobleski weighs in at 9/16 oz."
