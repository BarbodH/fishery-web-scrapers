Caught eleven trolling and had never been on the lake before except when it was iced over and ice fished for them. Pattern last year was just trolling a #11 Rapala. We were marking fish at about 30 ft, the Rapalas were running 10-12 ft. and they would come up on them with no problem. When we stopped for a shore lunch, we put out two rods with Cisco's on them and caught three, missed three more. Lot's of islands, humps, ridges on Crow, but if you have a good map, good GPS and good electronics you should have a great time. Hope this little bit helps. Will be there this coming weekend and hope to have the same luck as last year. Hawker"
