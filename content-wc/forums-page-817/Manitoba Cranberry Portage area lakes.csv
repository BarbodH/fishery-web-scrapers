539601,Mike M (Sask),2004-05-17 14:39:00,374,"Hi NW Angler I'm also heading there on May 22. It looks like there will still be at least some ice, I'm just not sure how much. From Cranberry we quite often trailer the boats to Athapap (Paradise Lodge area or Bakers Narrows area) when there is still ice on a lot of lakes. For what ever reason these areas are usually off earlier. Not only that the fishing is good too. Here is a link to a guide's site. He goes by Northern Manitoban and spends alot of time in the Reed Lake area. The link will take you to his forum and they are discussing the ice situation right now.http://www.xtremesportfishing.com/fo...p?category=all"

539605,NW Angler,2004-05-17 18:18:00,18,"I appreciate the info, Mike! We plan to check-in to our cabin on Rocky Lake (Wanless) on May 27. Hopefully the ice will have cleared on the lakes by then. Will be monitoring the website you referenced for the ice conditions. We did very well on pike last year. Would like to catch a lake trout or two this year in addition to another big pike. Thanks! -NWA"
