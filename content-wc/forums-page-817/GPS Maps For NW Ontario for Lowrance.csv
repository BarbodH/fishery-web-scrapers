539517,rebelrn2001,2004-05-14 07:21:00,1563,"I just got off the phone with Lowrance. I noticed on the LEI web site that the info about the FreedomMaps says it is the same info as the MapCreate 6. I looked and I had the MapCreate 5. I called Lowrance and they are going to send me the MapCreate 6 -2 day air for $60 (49.95 plus 10.00 for the expedited shipping). I will then send back their MapCreate 5 and they will credit me the $100 they are charging until they get it. So if you have the ""6"", you have the same as the Freedom Maps and if you have the ""5"", you can upgrade for $50 and get the whole North America!!! Just in case anyone needed to know. Dan"
539526,Guest,2004-05-14 08:55:00,0,"The MapCreate 6.2 is not near the detail of the FreedomMaps mapping. For the area I fish in NW Ontario the MapCreate will zoom into only about 30 Miles while the FreedomMap chip zooms into .001 miles. MapCreate shows virtually no lake outline detail which would be of use in navigation, the Icons will cover a 5 mile section of lake. Just want you to know that MapCreate 6.2 is fine for the US but virutally no lake outline detail north of the border. Paul"
539530,Guest,2004-05-14 10:06:00,0,"They are coming out with a Map Create for Canada but it has not been released yet. They were supposed to release it mid May, still waiting to seee it."
539543,rebelrn2001,2004-05-14 14:36:00,1563,"Well then I got screwed by Lowrance. I specifically asked them if it was the same as the FreedomMaps and they (Chris--the only Chris there) told me yes it was the same. If I get it and it isn't any better than what I had w/the MapCreate 5 they will hear about it. I specifically asked for the guy's name because I have learned that when dealing with a company...get their names otherwise you can NEVER get any resolution to a problem that isn't YOUR OWN problem...besides, their web site says it is the same as the FreedomMaps."
539547,Guest,2004-05-14 15:29:00,0,Here is a link for Canada Map Create software but I'm not sure if they have stock yet. I asked my local sporting good store today and they did not have any yet.http://gpsdepot.ca/product_info.php?...roducts_id=256
539550,rebelrn2001,2004-05-14 16:35:00,1563,"I have been dealing w/Lowrance and LEI for the past hr. They did not catch my order for the MapCreate so I will have to send that back/refuse it when it comes. I did manage to get assist ordering the F29. One of my coworkers took the last call. They are going to 'make one' for me to get out on Monday, the second shipment group. They are aware I don't want it if it isn't here by Thursday. I sure hope this hassle is worth the time/money vs what I have now for detail which is crap. My hats off to the people at Lowrance/LEI for the assist so far, I hope I get it in time and it is what I hoped for. Thanks to all of you here on WC for the help too. I wouldn't have known about this w/o this site. I already know the area I fish pretty well but I would like to go exploring this year some more. The lake is huge (Wabigoon) and I'd like to travel more than the 5 miles or so I go now. This way, w/some detail on my map, I could ask the lodge owner to show me some lesser traveled areas on the map in my GPS and pop in waypoints and go their....that is the goal. Dan"
539551,Guest,2004-05-14 18:09:00,0,"I hope you get it in time and hope it meets your expectations. Good luck on Wabigoon, I'll be fishing the lake the second week in June. Let me know how the maps work out for you."
539552,rebelrn2001,2004-05-14 21:01:00,1563,"Northern Eye. Any suggestions you can share about Wabigoon? We stay at Merkels Camp. Nice people. I probably spend as much or more time in Butler than Wabigoon. I normally fish for pike but do manage to keep a limits worth of walleyes to take home and eat a few. I just have not really had a lot of luck w/the walleyes or smallmouth or even perch for that matter. The last day last year my wife put on a Shallow Diving Shad Rap in a bay on Butler and almost immediately caught 2 eater 'eyes. I did the same and caught another. Usually I cast spoons and walleye will take that once in a while but I am hoping I was on to something there. There are a few bays on Wabigoon I go to too and have some fun for pike. Two years ago I found 2 spots where the fish were still along the shore...NICE pike--30-35"". I'd cast a big plug near shore and BAM, 3 of 4 casts in a row plus some others the first trip to that little spot and I'd usually catch a few each day after that...I'm hoping by going a little earlier this year it will be the same (I read in '02 that they had a late ice out and I was there about early June). Thanks in advance for any tips. Dan"
539584,Guest,2004-05-16 21:36:00,0,"I fished Wabigoon for the first time last year (only one day). As you know the water is very colored. We fished a variety of humps for Walleye. The fish seem to be in very shallow water, find a hump 4-8 ft of water and work it with live bait and you will get fish (some large ones). I will be fishing for three days this year so should learn alot more about the lake this summer. Lots of water to fish."
539459,Guest,2004-05-12 09:23:00,0,"I installed a Lowrance X18 and was looking around for detailed maps for the unit. The MapCreate 6.2 has very limited one could say no detail once you get above the US border (zooms into about 30-40 mile range). My search led to the FreedomMaps topo series chip F40T (North Ontario and Eastern Manitoba) which I ordered from Lowrance/LEI. I received it last Friday and have to say it is just what I was looking for. It is basically a topo map with the area details including lake and island outline detail. I looked at Navionics and they have only Eagle, LOTW and Rainy Lake but of course with depth etc, but it was of no use for me fishing Lac Seul and the English River. This FreedomMaps chip will zoom to .01 mile detail and while it doesn't have all of the detail (limited elevations) you get on a paper topo map, it sure looks good for navigating those lakes full of islands. Thought this might save someone from going through the same circles I went through trying to sort through this stuff. Paul"
539470,Guest,2004-05-12 17:55:00,0,"Thanks for the information. I had the same problem, no information on anything north of LOTW. Map create had nothing much, the Navionics chip had nothing. I'll have to look around and see if I can find the freedon map."
539473,rebelrn2001,2004-05-12 20:41:00,1563,I looked at the FreedomMap site and the Lowrance site. The code number for the same map is different for the two sites. The code for the Ontario map from FreedomMap is F40T but the LEI site shows it as F29. I leave for Canada a week from Friday and plan to call LEI or a few local places around Green Bay to see if they might have one in stock. I'd think this would sell like hotcakes if it has pretty good detail on the island locations etc. I have the are on my unit I fish in in Canada and it is pretty crude (Lac Seul had some large islands but nothing very good at all). These maps don't have any depths on them do they? I wish I could see one before ordering but for $100 I'd probably order it.
539478,rebelrn2001,2004-05-13 07:32:00,1563,"I just spoke to LEI, they say that the FreedomMaps is more for driving and city streets etc. She made sure that I knew that the map was not very good for lake/water navigation. I sure would like to see how good it is but if I'd order one, they do not allow you to return it...so just a warning to those who might order one, be informed it might not be what you'd have expected. Dan"
539481,Guest,2004-05-13 08:40:00,0,"The difference between the F29 and F40T is that the F40T is the topographic map, it has just become available recently and per the Lowrance technician I spoke sith has more detail than the F29. The F40T is a 256MB chip and the F29 is a 280MB as I recall. The F40T has good detail. I wish they had images on their web sites to show this detail so a guy knows what he is buying. I did not mention but the F40T was not orderable on the LEI site a couple weeks ago but the Lowarance site showed it as available. I actually bought it over the phone while talking with the SW technician who was answering my questions. Paul"
539483,Guest,2004-05-13 09:25:00,0,"I should have proof read the previous post. Should have said "" the F29 is a 128MB chip"" The F40T is $149 and the F29 is $99 Paul"
539487,Guest,2004-05-13 10:35:00,0,"I just bought the F40 for my X-15 and the detail is great. I had been using a Garmin Map 76 until this year and the detail on the freedom map is much better. They show rivers and most islands, the contours are handy. I compared the F40 and F29 and the only differnce is the F40 has land contours (not water contours) also, the F40 includes Northern Ont and Manitoba. The F29 includes more of Northern Ontario and only half of Manitoba. So, depending on where you fish you may want to compare the two different zones."
539488,Guest,2004-05-13 10:57:00,0,"I agree Northern Eye, I was impressed with it. I was a little apprehensive about whether it would have the detail I wanted but am convinced it will get us around any of those lakes. We have been fishing Lac Seul, Umfreville and Lake of the Woods for Muskie and with the islands in LOTW this will be real handy. Paul"
539506,rebelrn2001,2004-05-13 20:24:00,1563,"Let me get this straight. For fishing I'd want the F40T over the F29. Also, am I right in saying that neither have water/depth etc contours?...that they just show islands/shorelines? I'd maybe buy the F40T then but how do you get it if Lowrance doesn't have it. I think I looked for avenues to get if from the web site from the one that isn't LEI (I can't think of its name). I leave for Canada next Friday. Any help would be great. Thanks."
539508,Guest,2004-05-13 21:18:00,0,"rebelrn The only difference between the F40 and F29 is, the F40 has land contours and it covers all of Manitoba but only Northern Ontario (south to the US border, West to Saskatchewan border and East to Sault Ste Marie). F29 does not have land contours and covers 1/2 of Manitoba but more of Northern Ontario East to about North Bay Ont. The detail on both chips for shore lines and islands etc is the same. I purchased the contour map (F40)but only beacause it included all of Manitoba. You are correct that there are no lake depths or water contours on either. If you just fish NW ontario I would save some money just buy the F29. See the link attached for a canadian supplier http://www.lebaron.ca/pdffiles/fishing/lo_ifind.pdf"
