539438,Road King,2004-05-11 11:44:00,109,Anybody know what the current gas price is in Saskatchewan. We are heading up early June and I am trying to figure out the rough trip cost for everyone. Thanks. I didn't see the previous post. Sorry.
539452,BobH,2004-05-11 22:07:00,39,Today in Regina the gas price was $89.9/litre however prices have been fluctuating like crazy lately. If you don't mind me asking are you coming to fish and if so where? BobH
539454,Wall@y@,2004-05-12 00:03:00,191,I'm not worried about gas prices so much as I am about when will the ice be off the lakes. I'm headed for Besnard lake above Prince Albert at the end of May and the ice is still on Besnard. Bummer!!
539479,DAVIS_VIEHBECK,2004-05-13 07:35:00,15,Regular unleaded gas is up to 97.5 cents/litre in the Thunder Bay area. -Davis
539490,Road King,2004-05-13 12:29:00,109,BobH We go to a remote cabin out of SLIMS resort near Sandy Bay which is NW of Flin Flon. Have been going there for several years now. I love Canada but hate the drive from Nebraska.
539545,Northern Manitoban,2004-05-14 15:15:00,195,Time for the people to do something about these rediculous gas prices but everyone has to do it.Don't buy any fuel from Petro Canada or Shell Canada! these gas companys are robbing us and they control the market.If everyone was to shut them down then you will see the prices come down.
539591,Guest,2004-05-17 09:21:00,0,"Northern Manitoban, What are the current prices that far north? I am headed up to Flin Flon area beginning of next month. I guessing in Sherridan we will end up paying around $2.50 a litre or so... We paid $2.00 a litre there last year. Steve"
539595,Northern Manitoban,2004-05-17 12:05:00,195,Steve gas here is now 88 cents a litre but I'm betting come the long weekend it will be over 90 cents? Where are you going fishing? Athapap?Kissising? NMhttp://www.xtremesportfishing.com
539627,VMS,2004-05-18 12:20:00,1103,We will be on Kississing on the 13th of June. Should be a good trip seeing as though ice still has yet to leave the lake. Hopefully water temps will be in the middle 50's to lower 60s or so...Then the pike should still be shallow...hopefully. Steve
