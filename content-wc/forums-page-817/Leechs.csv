539516,Atlanta Dave,2004-05-14 07:20:00,323,Does anyone have an idea of how many leechs are in a pound? Thanks in advance for the help. Atlanta dave
539521,Guest,2004-05-14 07:53:00,0,No. Plan on 1 lb./man/week.
539523,Guest,2004-05-14 08:46:00,0,"Depends on the size. For Medium I would say 150-200, small 200-300. Hope this helps."
539524,lunker99,2004-05-14 08:48:00,236,"Not going to be much more help with my answer either. It depends on what size you get. We use med-large so the pound/man/week recommendation is fairly close if you only use leeches for bait for the week. If you went with the jumbo size, may not be enough."
539525,lunker99,2004-05-14 08:50:00,236,I see Aaron is a faster typer than I am!
539529,Guest,2004-05-14 09:41:00,0,I use the 1/2 lbs per day/per guy rule. We use Jumbos and this cuts it pretty close.

539554,rebelrn2001,2004-05-14 22:01:00,1563,Wouldn't there be another part of the equasion? How many fish do you plan on catching? I know several lakes where one leech per day is plenty!!! I find then too often.
539561,Guest,2004-05-16 05:15:00,0,dear atlanta dave there r about 180 leeches per pound so for example if 4 guys going for 5 days it would work out to be about 10 leeches a day for each guy...a half pound of leeches should last one guy at least 2 very hard fishing days...hoped this helped
