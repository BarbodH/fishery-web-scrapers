539540,fishnmagicin,2004-05-14 12:43:00,45,I live up here in the north and there is no ice left. I will fish the St. Marys for the opener. No place like home. Next weekend I will venture alittle farther north!!! Went out last night for pike in my tee-shirt. Not that cold guys.
539445,Guest,2004-05-11 15:53:00,0,The Trans Canada is closed from the Manitoba Border all the way to Ignace. Up to 8in of snow and major winds. Bring your warm stuff for the opener this weekend.
539453,Guest,2004-05-11 23:02:00,0,Snow will change to rain overnight and through the day tomorrow for much of northwestern Ontario. Temps are expected to rise and the snow should hopefully be gone by the weekend. 10-15 degrees (50-60F) and sunny forecast for opener (Saturday) right now with water levels on the rise in Lac Seul (amongst other places).
539465,DAVIS_VIEHBECK,2004-05-12 11:53:00,15,"Hey All, If you're coming up to Northwestern Ontario, bring WARM clothes, as in what you wear ice fishing. Temperatures are not what you'd call balmy. -davis"
539493,fishmaster,2004-05-13 15:31:00,209,Heard reports that parts of 502 is closed. If going this way better check at the border on road conditions. Looks like the opener will bring us wearing ice fishing clothes. Good luck!!!!! Can't wait rain or snow.
539495,Atlanta Dave,2004-05-13 17:45:00,323,Last I heard All lakes in ontario and Quebec are still frozen I guess all openers have been cancelled. Atlanta dave
539500,Guest,2004-05-13 19:01:00,0,Yup...They're all frozen still. The ice is real unsafe so you might want to either stay home or ask about ice free lakes at the local bar. The boys will be glad to help you out.
539502,Walleye_Slayer,2004-05-13 19:30:00,134,i heard lac suel was open from a real good source are you guys trolling or telling the truth. I work hard to spend my money in your country and don't jerk my chain give me a honest report. A Bad Day Fishing is Better than the Best Day at Work Best Reguards Walleye_Slayer
539503,Trailerguy,2004-05-13 19:53:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Your chain can't be jerked unless you're willing. It will be a chilly opener, but don't plan on ice fishing on Lac Suel."
539512,Guest,2004-05-14 05:20:00,0,"Looks like Canadian Guy got his first ""hit"" of the season."
539534,Guest,2004-05-14 11:16:00,0,"Ice went out on Mother's day; Tuesday we were hit with 8"" of snow here at Ear falls, half or more of that is gone, warm weather forecasted for weekend and early next week, should straighten things out fast. I just came in from putting in the last of my docks, some slushy ice in the quiete corners but no problems with boating; don't let the jerks give you a hard time; look for a great opener as usual and enjoy the Great White North an walleye fishing."
