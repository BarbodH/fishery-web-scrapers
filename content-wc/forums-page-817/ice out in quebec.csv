539688,Guest,2004-05-19 13:12:00,0,"Thank you very much for the info. Yes we fly in with an outfitter to Lichtenger. It is actually another smaller lake close to Lichtenger called Lake Clarke. We are supposed to fly out a week from Saturday and are hoping we can get in. If not, we have to wait until mid August. If you can give me further reports of weather or thoughts of ice cover in this region it would be very much appreciated. Thanks Millerman"

The next 10 days will probably free up your destination. For comparison, this link is for Mistassini 200 miles southeasthttp://weather.ec.gc.ca/forecast/city_e.html?QC-91 Your mean temps will be about 1/2 way of the two locations."
539703,Guest,2004-05-19 14:47:00,0,"McQ, Thank you very much for the info. If you ever have interest in this outfitter let me know. This lake is an outstanding walleye lake along excellent northern pike fishing. The last two years we have caught and released several 40""+ Northerns along with 1 50"" each of the last two years. Thanks again for the info. Millerman"
539704,McQ,2004-05-19 15:00:00,615,"Millerman, give me an email - [email protected]"
539507,Guest,2004-05-13 21:11:00,0,Any info on whether the ice is out on Lake O'Sullivan in Quebec--its 200 miles directly north of Ottawa (and 75 miles in the Clova Rd)? Thanks
539511,Guest,2004-05-14 00:14:00,0,"That isn't exactly close to where I live but I am in north western quebec and the ice went off the bigger lakes this week. Pretty sure the ice is off everywhere now, or almost."
539514,McQ,2004-05-14 06:30:00,615,"Lakes within 6 hours of Ottawa or Montreal will be ice free through this week if not already. Further north towards James Bay will take a couple of weeks longer. I'm due to go in to the Gouin at River Nemio Outfitter on the 21st of May, the owner called me on Monday with a progress report and stated that there was still lots of snow but open water everywhere and by this weekend everything should be open."
539549,Alces,2004-05-14 16:19:00,35,"Sorry to disapoint you McQ just come back from Gouin. The rivers, NÃ©mio, Motard, Eau Claire, Portage, Rencontre are free of ice, the small bays are free of ice, Baie du Sud is free but all the majors water plans on the Gouin reservoir are still frozen over. We are planning to get in by next wednesday just in time for the opening on the 21st. Looks like the water level is pretty high, just about a meter from beeing full, fishing should be interesting, will see you on opening week-end, have a good one"
539555,McQ,2004-05-15 07:08:00,615,"Alses, thanks for the disappointment - I'm grinning from ear to ear. This will be a great opening week and looking forward to getting the season off to a successful start. We will be arriving at Nemio after lunch on Saturday and will be in until Wednesday."
539608,Andre M,2004-05-17 19:55:00,86,Ice is gone on mostly all parts of the reservoir. Water level is high. Fishing should be good. McQ I will be up-there from the 21st. till the 25th. Will try to get in touch. Good fishing!!
539611,Alces,2004-05-18 05:14:00,35,"Been there yesterday, all small bays are cleared but major body of water are still frozen over, Baie du sud, de l'est, Plamondon and most of Adolphe poisson are OK.Brochu, Mc Sweeney, Marmette, Chapman, Bouzanquette, Magnan are still frozen over, not expected to be free of ice before friday. Sorry, still winter up here"
539613,Guest,2004-05-18 06:39:00,0,you said you were in north west quebec and ice was off most of the lake.---can you tell us exactly where you are located? we are looking for an ice out report on Lac Lichteneger----do you have any info?? Thank You
539650,Guest,2004-05-19 00:52:00,0,"Uh, would lac lichteneger be in the james bay area? If so thats a little farther north than where I am. But I can tell you this; I am in the abitibi region and we had some heavy rain and warm sunny weather this week, so I am almost 100% sure that all lakes are ice free as of this week. Unless you are going waaay up north then that may be another story. Hope this helps."
539658,McQ,2004-05-19 05:33:00,615,"millerman, you have peaked my curiosity. Lake Lichteneger is at the 52 parallel, fishing season opens on June 1st. This area is further north than I usually travel but I have canoed the Rupert system a few years back. Is there a lodge operator on Lichteneger or is it part of COTA. Certainly the area has a boundless fishery and I expect you will find it to be ice free on or around the 1st of June."
