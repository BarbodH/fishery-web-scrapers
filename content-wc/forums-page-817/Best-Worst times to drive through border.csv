539677,Guest,2004-05-19 10:03:00,0,I think it's best to cross the border when you get there.
539684,Guest,2004-05-19 12:18:00,0,"We cross about 1:00 on Friday afternoon and usually only 2-3 cars. We come home on Friday morning because my experience is that the border is a zoo on Saturday, not worth the hassle to me."
539719,Guest,2004-05-20 00:21:00,0,ever since the line was backed up the city limits of fort francis which was probably an 8 hour line we just go to baudette to cross coming back. 3 cars tops on a saturday and no hassle and no #### brdge toll either.
