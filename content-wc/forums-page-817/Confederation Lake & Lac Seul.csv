Was it worth the drive? I hear the road heading up there is really rough from the logging trucks. One other question, does anyone else hate the way Lac Seul has become more and more popular? It used to be that you might see a few boats running around......but now, now it's like going to Rainy Lake. Busy. Good Luck and Good Fishing"
539671,Guest,2004-05-19 09:00:00,0,Have not been to Conderation Lake for 3 years. I would say the Lake Trout fishing is average at best. I have only been there in early summer. Best bet is to troll with down riggers. Pike are average and no walleye.
539706,Walleyefisher,2004-05-19 15:21:00,159,I think I'll stick with Lac Seul then. Thanks
539709,Guest,2004-05-19 16:02:00,0,"most of those boats ""running around"" couldn't catch a cold. fear not. the fishery is safe. and, it's nothing like rainy. yet."
