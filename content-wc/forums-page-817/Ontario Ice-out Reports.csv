539458,alderboy,2004-05-12 08:52:00,1,"I've been trying to monitor the ice conditions on Arc Lake (52 miles N N/E of Sioux Lookout) with little success. We fly out of Sioux Lookout in two weeks and am wondering if I should be bringing poles or tip-ups. Either way, it's worth it! Deparately need some time on the water. Any information is appreciated. Alderboy"
539505,clemento,2004-05-13 20:09:00,48,"Alderboy, I fish a Hooker Lake with Hidden Bay Lodge. I sent you an email. Did you get it? I know nothing about the ice conditions, but I have made an annual trip to Hooker in July fo the past 20 years. Thought maybe we could help each other out with some information."
539542,fishnmagicin,2004-05-14 12:46:00,45,All ice is out!!!! Wawa lake went out last week and I haven't heard if any lakes still have any.
539352,Guest,2004-05-07 05:48:00,0,"As for lakes north of Sault and close to Wawa. I live across the road from Airdale, where they winter their outpost planes in the Sault, and all the planes (the Beavers) left this week for their northern lake summer locations.(eg hawk Junction) So lakes must be open near Wawa too!. (and for sure by opener)"
539379,Guest,2004-05-09 09:12:00,0,"ICE OUT!! We woke this morning to a clear cove and ice out, main lake usually ices out same day as cove or within 24 hours; Water levels are Ok and rising and we look forward to a great opening weekend. Our neighbors as well as our camp have a cabin or two open for any of you last minute walleye hunters. Travel well and dream walleye!"
539394,Pakman,2004-05-10 05:21:00,7,Ice went out on Pakwash yesterday and last night. Almost to the day as last year.(Mothers' Day)
539401,MrEyes,2004-05-10 06:58:00,360,"Gary, I am coming up to your lodge (May 22-29) for the first time. Do I need to bring my own life jacket? Mark"
539414,Guest,2004-05-10 14:18:00,0,Does anyone have an ice report on Favorable Lake? Thanks!
539415,Toolman,2004-05-10 14:26:00,2570,Thanks for the report Jake! Tim
539424,Guest,2004-05-10 20:28:00,0,I take the P in PFD really personal and always wear my own favorite; we do have life jackets available at camp if you need one.
539425,Winnie,2004-05-10 21:24:00,375,"Gary, When do you think the spawn will start and finish? How soon after that do the sows usually start binging? I'll be fishing the NW part of the lake in a couple weeks. Thanks."
539432,MrEyes,2004-05-11 07:52:00,360,"Gary, I plan on bringing my own jacket. Should I bring my own trolling motor? We plan on upgrading our boat. This will be my first time to Lac Seul. I have been to Canada before however my fishing partner has NEVER been to Canada. I'm looking forward to seeing my fishing buddy get the Canada-itch. Mark"
539446,Guest,2004-05-11 16:29:00,0,"Week of the ""Whales"" is usually Memorial Day week give or take with water temps, we are getting one heck of a snow storm right now, 6-8"". Remember to handle easy, take a picture and carefully let them go!!"
539235,Guest,2004-04-30 11:38:00,0,"Ice in Red Lake still there and may be a while yet. Hasn't melted away from shore yet but starting to look a bit rotten. Seems to be candling from underneath. Sure not melting from any warm weather we're getting. Got about 3"" of snow today and temps. forecast to be below normal for a couple days. Unless we get some real nice weather,,and soon, could be ice fishing for the opener."
539247,Atlanta Dave,2004-04-30 21:13:00,323,Just trying to find out if the ice is leaving and if it is on time . we go to Athabasca but just trying to judge by your ice out. Atlanta Dave
539251,Guest,2004-05-01 10:43:00,0,"Last year we were completely open on May 8. Depending on the weather over the next few days, it should go right around there give or take 3 or 4 days. I would consider this a fairly normal year even though the last week has been very cool. Hope that helps a bit, but the truth is that guessing is tough. It only takes one day of wind and warm rain to equal a weeks worth of cool sunshine. Mike Willems"
539255,the_bronco,2004-05-01 18:54:00,86,"Thanks for the reports guys, I can hardly wait to get there. Jim"

539281,Toolman,2004-05-03 12:54:00,2570,Anybody know if the lakes north of Wawa are ice-free? A buddy of mine is scheduled to go to Apisabigo for the opener. Thanks. Tim

539286,Mahumba,2004-05-03 20:48:00,345,"Brickhouse, It's good as gone now. You'll be laughin! Roger Mayer."
539350,Guest,2004-05-07 01:11:00,0,How about the ice on Trout lake ?

539215,Guest,2004-04-29 18:38:00,0,"South Central Lac Seul - There is just a sliver of open water around the lake edge at the lodge. Even though the ice looks rotten, I would guess that we are more than a week away from open. Mike Willems SWWL"
539216,Mahumba,2004-04-29 19:30:00,345,"Same in the Thunder Bay area Mike, Roger Mayer."

539224,Guest,2004-04-30 08:44:00,0,"Mahumba, When does the ice typically go out in the Thuder Bay area? I am looking at going to Pakashkan near Upsala in Late May or late June. Thanks for any help. Brickhouse"
539231,Guest,2004-04-30 10:57:00,0,"Mosts of the bays are open, NW Bay etc. A little left around the causeway. Gone any day now. sm rainy"
539232,Guest,2004-04-30 11:01:00,0,"Atlanta Dave, Typical ice-out across northwest ontario is usually somewhere between the last week of April and second week of may, sometimes earlier and sometimes (like 2002) later. The Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Quetico Park area usually goes before the Lac Seul, Eagle Lake, Wabigoon Lake area. Inland lakes west of Thunder Bay are very close to open (possibly today). All rivers are flowing well and the steelhead fishing has been good for the past week."
539233,Guest,2004-04-30 11:14:00,0,Can anyone tell me about the Red Lake Area. Flying out opening weekend. Thanks
