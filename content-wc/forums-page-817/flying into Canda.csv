Now I often have clients fly in on private planes and they just need to stop by one of these airports to go through the customs and then takeoff again and fly to closest airport to over here. Now they don't have to stop as soon as they cross the border but they may be contacted and asked about their destination, I am sure like mentioned above a travel plan should be forwarded to the right autorities. So if you were to fly to the Northwest Territories your plane would not stop untill it got there way after the border, no need to stop at the first one of fifth for that mater. Keep releasing them all Richard Collinhttp://www.trophymuskiecharters.com"
539522,phidelt157,2004-05-14 08:31:00,191,Everyone - thanks for the info... Skylane - Where to do you fly from and to for your trips? I'm trying to get a rough estimate on how much av fuel will cost us/how much we'll use. What does it normally cost you round trip? Thanks again
539548,Guest,2004-05-14 16:01:00,0,"phidelt157, These days I fly from the farm (central IL, south of Champaign) to the airport in Dryden, ON where I have an old pickup stashed and drive it out to our cabin on Dinorwic lake. We use to fly into Kenora before we bought the property. Depends on what plane you have as to the fuel usage, I plan about 13 gallons an hour on my Cessna 182 (230 horse) and 15 gph on the Cessna 185 which is 300 horse. You might want to look up aviation fuel prices on Google and try to find the cheapest fuel along your route. I would expect (judgeing from the increase in car gas) you will average $2.75 a gallon if you watch where you buy, but that is only a guess as I have not flown much since February and have not kept up with prices. In my case it will probably run about $450 round trip. If you happen to be going through Wisonsin and Minnisota I can suggest a couple of gas stops. Do your home work and you will be able to save a bunch on gas as the prices vary as much as $.75 per gallon. Have fun planning."

539455,phidelt157,2004-05-12 07:03:00,191,"We are flying into Canada this year for our annual fly in trip. We'll be flying through the ""soo."" Here's the question: How do the customs agents handle planes? Is it the same as if we were in a car? Any help from anyone who does this on a semi-regular basis would be appreciated."
539456,retire55,2004-05-12 07:25:00,1029,Here's a start http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/E/pub/cp/...tml#P228_17106
539461,Guest,2004-05-12 10:14:00,0,"No different than driving across the boarder. You have to go through customs when you reach your destination airport. They will ask you some questions, want to know why you are there and what you are bringing. You may or may not be singled out for further scrutinizing. Have you passport and or current divers liscense and birth certificate."
539463,phidelt157,2004-05-12 10:22:00,191,"When we reach our destination, or when we reach the border?"
539464,Guest,2004-05-12 11:01:00,0,"Its right as the plane crosses the border, we have a huge runway on a hot air balloon and a customs officer that has to climb that ladder from ground every morning, (without spilling his Tim Hortons coffee) He will check your passport and question you regarding your trip. If you have any potatoes or worms in the wrong type of bedding he will throw them off the ""runway in the sky"" down to the dumpsters below. Of course its at your destination ! same as when you fly from, NewYork to Amsterdam. The Sault Airport has customs officers to handle this."
539469,Guest,2004-05-12 15:38:00,0,"Sooboy, Don't quit the day job for stand-up comedy with that one! Cut the guy some slack,He's probably not a professional pilot like your self."
539474,rebelrn2001,2004-05-12 20:43:00,1563,I was believing it there for a while.
539476,Guest,2004-05-13 05:12:00,0,"Call customs at least 2 hours before arriving in Canada, have all your plane paperwork available if they ask for it. They ask you the usual questions, (where are you from, where are you going, what is the purpose of the trip, ect) and may or may not ask for proof of citizenship. Depending on your port of entry, I have even had times when I arrived that the customs people were not there and when I called they told me to go on. No big deal, treat them the way you want to be treated and everthing will be fine. In my case 6 hours flying sure the heck beats an 18 hour car ride. The only downside is the price of av-gas, makes car gas seem like a bargain. Soon as the crops are planted I'm winging north. Happy flying!"
539477,phidelt157,2004-05-13 06:16:00,191,"""Of course its at your destination ! same as when you fly from, NewYork to Amsterdam. The Sault Airport has customs officers to handle this."" Soo boy, I appreciate the humor, but you still haven't answered the question. ""Of course its at your destination,"" our destination isn't Sault Ste. Marie. Our outfitter doesn't have his base in the Soo, plus we heard the walleye fishing in the locks isn't that great. ""The sault airport has customs officers to handle this,"" are you saying the the sault agents are at every paved airstip in Ontario? My understanding is that we'll need to touch down as soon as we cross the border and do the usual routine as if we were driving, is this correct?"
539491,Guest,2004-05-13 13:16:00,0,Actually the fishing in the locks and St Mary's river is very good right now. Many anglers are searching for Whitefish and Steelhead. But Skylane gave you all the particulars about calling before and from your destination.
