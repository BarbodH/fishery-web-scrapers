My dad was able to 2 times in the early 80's they were only allowed to fish Pamusik Creek and not allowed on to the lake due to regulations from the lodge but the 3rd time trying to get back there not sure but if I remember correctly the lodge took the road out so no one could get to it. Any ways I was looking at there web site and like all of them it looks promising. I am not much on the American plan packages but would be interested in there outposts. So i guess I am just looking for any info on that area if anyone has any.
