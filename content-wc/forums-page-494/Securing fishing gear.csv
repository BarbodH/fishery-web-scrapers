1304257,champ8,2011-05-08 10:34:00,40,This year I will be driving up to LOW and spending the night at either baudette or international falls. I was wondering if most people bring their more expensive gear into their rooms or if they leave them in their boat at night. Does anyone have any horror stories about items being stolen from your boats at the area hotels?

Never had a problem over the years, though I always park my rig in front of my room.....if it is parked out of sight, I remove anything of value.....takes a few minutes, but well worth the effort. Key is to have your rig covered and under a lighted area, and close to your room where you can keep an eye on it....if someone wants to steal your items, they'll sure try but they will look for the easiest target. A cop told me years ago that most thieves are lazy, and go for the easiest item to steal....I do my best to make it difficult for someone to steal my gear. Good luck with your travels. Rich B"

Instead of having the nice high end custom cover on your boat, get a dirty crappy one instead. Place bubble wrap on the floor of your boat, entire sheets of it, or use a baby monitor walkie talkie. All this short of leaving a 10 foot ball python ( I know a pro who does this ) and keeping your boat in a well lit area, like the other guy said, you should be fine. We stay at various hotels in International Falls and Morson, never had a problem yet. We also make all the guys in our group make trips to the boat if they wake up to shake the snake. Making a physical trip to the boat makes your presence known to those that are casing your rig."

Keep the high end rods in a locker or bring them in the room. Tackle boxes in the middle of the boat, if you have windshields tuck the boxes under the consoles. Most thieves will not crawl into the boat, they will grab only what they can reach. As others said, they are lazy (else they would just get a job) and look for easy pickings. Make it easy and they will steal from you right in front of the police department of any city in America. I guess I would ask myself this question..........if they grab my stuff how will it effect my trip? Most guys have more then enough time to make a couple of trips to their rooms with gear."
1304560,Hawker,2011-05-09 08:41:00,3967,"We usually stop short of I-Falls, usually Orr! Have never (to date) had any problems with theft or attempted theft, but,,,,,,,,,,,,, we always bring the high end rods, tackle and electronics into the room just in case!! I always figure if it's gonna happen to anybody, it'll be me so I just don't take the chance! Only takes a couple trips to the room when we check in and check out and I'd much rather play the better safe than sorry routine!"
1304855,wallydave,2011-05-09 19:00:00,2151,"I can't imagine the feeling of planning a trip, twisting arms and convicing enough guys to fill out the cabin, the long time waiting for the trip to actually arrive, only to have your gear stolen, when you are close enough to smell the cool pine scented air of Canada. A few minutes of securing your gear, either in the room or vehicle, seems to be time well spent. In camp, we feel safe with our gear, we see the same folks in the fish cleaning hut and around the docks to leave our gear in the boats. That just one guys thoughts. Good luck, safe and great fishing!"
1304993,NARDA 1,2011-05-10 06:44:00,636,I haven't had a problem in 22 years. I just leave my gear at the lodge. Don't have to worry about transporting it or anyone stealing it and its there waiting for me when I need it.
