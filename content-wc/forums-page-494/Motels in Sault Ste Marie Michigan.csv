Always liked the idea of a casino when traveling with a vehicle full of stuff because they tend to have better security, lots of cameras, etc. It's a bit out of the way, but worth the trip when I was there anyway."
1303071,Fish_Heads,2011-05-04 21:04:00,154,The Holiday Inn Express in the Sault where we have stayed the last 5 trips north to Canada has almost doubled it's rates since last year. Any one have a good recommendation of a different one to try ?We liked the Holiday because it sat by itself on a hill with no thru traffic so we could sleep knowing the boat & contents would be safe.Going up the end of June.Any help / reviews would be appreciated.ThanksFish
1303117,Ogoki,2011-05-05 05:18:00,291,Check Super 8 on Business 75. Stayed there several times and it was clean and reasonably priced when I did a comparison.
1303194,Seanik,2011-05-05 08:48:00,218,"We spent the night last July at the Comfort Inn, There where boats in their parking lot and it seemed secure. They offer discounts, we had a double for 69.00. Seanik"
1303208,Fish_Heads,2011-05-05 09:39:00,154,"Thanks for the replies so far Guys.Apparently the weekend we want to stay over the Friday nite- Saturday morning is ""bridge walk weekend"" & that's why they bumped our rate from last year. About any other day I checked the rate is around $74.00, but that nite it's $125 Ouch !!I'm gonna be over that bridge by 7 am anyway.Fish"
1303228,Ogoki,2011-05-05 10:21:00,291,"I once checked the motel rates on the Canadian side on Great Northern Rd . on the way out of town, heading north . At the time they were comparable . There are several, plus you would already be heading out of town . We might do that this year . There are also several coffee shops and resturants nearby too. Just a thought . My second trip we are going thru the Soo. The other two we are going up thru Duluth as we use more U.S. gas ,which will save a few bucks . I hate to think about it but we will use over $2000 in gas these three trips . OUCH !! Good thing some of this will be split between a group but two of the trips will be just my wife and I . Good thing I am covered up with work . Will be many 70 hour weeks working this summer and fall."
1303327,Paul H,2011-05-05 15:44:00,1232,"Just a thought, but Mackinaw and St Ignace both seemed to have a LOT of excess rooms last year. I didn't stay there but was passing through and spent a few hours, several closed, lots of cheap rates on the signs. As long as travel is down they have way too many rooms and just an hour south - assuming that's the way you're going."

1304154,BuckeyeATC,2011-05-08 05:41:00,88,The Super 8 is now the Americas Best Value Inn. I have stayed there many times. It basically shares a parking lot with the Michigan State Patrol. I am actually able to park closer to their building than the hotel. Its usually pretty cheap $50-$60.
1304329,Opti-Mist,2011-05-08 16:55:00,1402,"There are a number of ""Mom & Pop"" local motels along Business Loop I-75. Their rates tend to be pretty good. Google ""Motels 49783"""
1304424,Fish_Heads,2011-05-08 20:43:00,154,I may have to check this one out !ThanksFish
