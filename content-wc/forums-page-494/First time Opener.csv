1305539,Steve Ediger,2011-05-11 09:25:00,97,I could use some help guys. I am going to the Ear Falls end of Lac Seul next week for the opener. I have fished Lac Seul many times but it has always been in June or July - not the opener. Any suggestions on what to do different now vs. summer would be appreciated. What types of locations should I look at first? Any tips will be helpful.
