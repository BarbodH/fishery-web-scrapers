I would like to track these temps up to my departure to plan my approach for the Walleye. Speaking of which. Any thoughts on the spawn? I understand water temp is key and they typically start to spawn at 42 degrees. Obviously based on the weather, but if anyone has any history with the ice out on around May 4th and how that related to the time of the spawn I would appreciate the insight."

That is, in those years, more male walleyes caught seem to still have ample remnants of the spawn, which show up during the hook removal process. Bill"
