Two great memories are: 1) Sitting on Taylor Island in a big snow eating beef tenderloins, wine tatos in in late September 2) Sitting @ Ojibwa #7 at Scalar lake in a pounding rain @ 6:00QAM and deciding to have an early happy hour We were able to do that stuff then, and appreciated it. Things change, cannot stop progress Enjoy every moment!!!!"

Coming into dock on Minnitaki in 1992, hearing the wife of a couple we fish with singing ""The hills Are Alive With the Sound of Music"" while trying to put the cover on the boat. Too many brewskies on the lake for her that day!!! (that was when we were young and could get away with that) 2. Watching my 15 yr old son try to water-ski off a rock in 1995 at Rough Rock. He insisted that he could pull this off and did a face plant in the water not to mention the ""rock rash."" There are so many more memories...........wow."

In the early days we'd sit out on the porch and talk in the evening after a 16 hour day of fishing smallies and eyes. The talk went something like: fast cars; fast women; how much we drank at the bar near the motel on the way up; saddened by the loss of The Flame (at IF): faster women; all the fish we caught; funny tales from out in the boat; starting a family; ...you get the picture. We'd even play cards all nite at the kitchen table, and then we'd hit the water again when the sun came up. About 5 years ago, we were talking about those early years, and parts of the previous paragraph came up. We had some good laughs; as we recanted a few memories and reflected on those who no longer were with us. But it didn't take long before the conversation shifted to health issues, trying to figure out who wasn't snoring the night before, hoping for a good night sleep, prescriptions, arms/backs/legs that ache, hoping it didn't rain anymore, etc. Oh yeah, everyone hit the rack before the sun set at 11:00 pm."
1305771,v-bay gord,2011-05-11 19:05:00,3168,Great topic.......and none of it involved how many hundreds of fish were caught. My thought is that is the last component on the list.......
