1299239,oldblue2008,2011-04-25 19:25:00,313,"Water still climbing, about 4 inches a day. They have increased the outflow, but it has been warm the last couple of days, so more water is coming down the river system. don't think boat launch will be quite ready for May 5th opener!"
1300224,oldblue2008,2011-04-27 23:46:00,313,"pics taken April 27th evening, water still climbing, just about got the docks in !! just gotta get to them! outflow at spillway is 50 cubic metres per second in this pic I believe,"
1301640,oldblue2008,2011-05-01 15:20:00,313,"We had a slight blizzard over the weekend, dumped some really wet snow, power outages, evergreens down all over,(including mine). Nothing compared to the poor souls in Alabama area though. We are so fortunate. Water is still climbing higher. The pic with the pelicans is the point at the end of the diversion channel bay from Boundary Dam. Was a fairly good walleye spot. Good thing I took the pump controls out of the panel box 10 days ago."
1302229,Slim,2011-05-02 20:22:00,102,"Hey Blue, does the fishing season start on the 5th of May this year. I always thought it opened on a Sat? Probably won't be fishable for some time. Heard anything about Alameda? Might try Lake Darling on Tues."
1302259,oldblue2008,2011-05-02 21:23:00,313,"From what I understand they have decided to make it May 5th every year from now on. Yes, it used to be the 2nd Saturday of the month. keep in mind they have reduced the limits as well. Alameda is up 26 feet from the low level back in March. They have been lowering it all winter. Rafferty is up 18 feet from its low point in late March. Rafferty, Alameda and Boundary are pretty much full to the nuts. During the height of the storm Friday night, Saturday, I am sure the waves were real close to the top of the dam on Rafferty as we had winds close to 60 mph. I was going to go out and have a look, but you couldn't see 10 feet. They are trying to keep the Souris within its banks downstream. I would think they are going to have to increase the outflow from both Rafferty and Alameda here shortly. good luck fishing somewhere else for the time being."
1305756,oldblue2008,2011-05-11 18:30:00,313,"We got 2 inches of rain last 2 days, which we didn't need.They are having to let more water out of Rafferty and Boundary Dam because of that, so flows down the Souris are going up more than they would like, and will cause some flooding for sure. It almost looks like the level has dropped an inch or two at the boat launch since last night, due to the higher water releases. It will be quite a while before the launch is sort of ""normal"". Maybe we have hit the peak, which is about 8 or 9 feet higher than the boat launch."
1297051,oldblue2008,2011-04-19 23:08:00,313,"Fishing season in southern Sask opens May 5th, BUT, with the fairly severe flooding taking place, fishing on Rafferty may be out of the question for a while. it has come up more than 12 feet in the past ten days, rising a foot each of the past 2 days, as they store water to try and lessen the impact downstream into North Dakota. Right now, the water is making its way into the parking lot at the boat launch, and there is the likely potential to have as much as 5 feet of water where the parking lot is now. Just thought I would give a heads up to the North Dakotans that like to come up, you had better check first before driving too far. We had hoped to put the docks in soon, but that is not going to happen. We had also put some pipe extensions on the existing dock anchor pipes to make them more visible, but those extensions are even under water, so will certainly pose a danger to anyone trying to launch a boat and motor anywheres near the old dock area. Have attached a pic taken today, April 19th for those familiar with the boat launch area. Alameda has also risen 16 feet in the past 10 days and is now above full supply level, so not sure about launch there either. oldblue2008"
1297281,tlee,2011-04-20 12:32:00,65,WOW! I can't believe that...I thought it was high last year. I fish up there a lot during the summer and this does not look good!
1297436,oldblue2008,2011-04-20 18:58:00,313,"here it is today, April 20thRafferty came up about 15 inches in past 24 hours, it covers an area of over 12,000 acres."
1297626,tlee,2011-04-21 09:44:00,65,That is just amazing! Do you think that will go down by the middle of May? Will fishing be any good at all? Keep the photos coming.
1297691,oldblue2008,2011-04-21 12:34:00,313,"here is a link that you can check the levels of Rafferty and Alameda etc they say that the Souris river is starting to flow more west of Estevan, and that water ends up in Rafferty, so will wait and see. still not releasing any more water from Rafferty at the moment.http://www.swa.ca/WaterManagement/St...20Watershed%27 Will post some more pics tonite."
1297778,oldblue2008,2011-04-21 17:11:00,313,"level still climbing, approx 9 feet higher than it was March 1st. Also, they have reduced the provincial possession limit for Walleye from 5 down to 4. Rafferty is still at 3. Alameda will be affected, as it will drop from 5 to 4 possession limit. oldblue2008"
1298306,oldblue2008,2011-04-23 05:44:00,313,"They opened the gates on the main spillway yesterday morning. Took this pic shortly after. They doubled the outflow later in the day. It is supposed to actually warm up this weekend, into the 50's and maybe 60's. Still lots of water to enter the system from the west so will see if they can juggle the water between Rafferty, Alameda and Boundary Dam enough that they don't flood downstream some more. it looks and sounds like Rafferty will have high water levels for a long time, and will be releasing water over the spring/summer to get it back down to more normal levels. Going to be a good question as to when we can get a dock back in the water."
1298546,skeeter 1880,2011-04-23 19:36:00,157,"Thanks guys for the update and pictures. WOW!!! I will let some of the guys in Nodak know, as there are quite a few that look forward for the opener up there."
1298603,oldblue2008,2011-04-23 22:20:00,313,"Came up another 7 inches in past 24 hours. They are trying to keep outflow to a minimum for as long as they can to let the Souris River drop as much as possible downstream. The Souris River runs down thru Minot, ND and then swings back up into Manitoba, and nobody really wants any more water."
1298755,oldblue2008,2011-04-24 12:25:00,313,Looks like it came up another 3-4 inches overnight.
