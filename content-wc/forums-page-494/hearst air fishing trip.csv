Fishing was typical of any northern lake, find the humps and weedlines and work them. We typically use jigs only as there easy to use and catch tons of fish. We caught more then enough fish to keep us happy while there and i'm sure the lake your going to you'll do the same. No complaints about the camps or lakes from me, had little issue with the pilot but he is no longer with them from what I uunderstand."
1298818,Pikehunters,2011-04-24 17:43:00,100,Fished napkin three years ago. Take extra 9 volt battery with you. When the carbon monoxide detector battery goes dead not only is it an anoying beep but it shuts off the fridge. Only took a couple of days but we got it figured out. No battery No fridge out of ice & warm beer not good Weather was deplorable the week we fished but for the time we did fish had no problem putting up good #'rs. Yes I know the weather couldn't be that bad let me tell ya one guy got blown off the dock trying to get out we still talk about it how could it rain horizontally for three days straight??

Great Cabin location on a rock point, newer outhouse and good boats and newer motors. We probably caught over 500 walleye in the week and right around the corner from the cabin. No large pike to speak of probably due to the unusually early spring and warm weather. (80 every day May15-21)Great family business, planes and pilots. if you want some more info or pictures e-mail [email protected].cheers.Rob"
