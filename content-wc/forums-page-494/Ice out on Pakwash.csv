1299717,LunkerG,2011-04-26 21:02:00,12,Anyone out there have any info on Pakwash Lake and ice out predictions? Having trouble finding out anything and we're heading up in 3 short weeks for Walleye Opener. Any info gets the fishing goo flowing! Thanks.

1300204,Pakwash Lake Camp,2011-04-27 21:48:00,17,We are down to 10 inches of good ice and 8-10 inches of slushy ice. The Rivers and creeks are open and most of the snow has melted in the bush. We are starting to see some signs of the ice breaking on the shoreline. No sign of the walleye spawning yet.
1301782,LunkerG,2011-05-01 19:59:00,12,Thanks much for the info. We're coming up on May 18 to start fishing on May 19 for 2 full days of Pike fishing before the Walleye Opener. I hope the ice is out by then!!! Is the lake level up ?
1302100,Pakwash Lake Camp,2011-05-02 14:30:00,17,The ice has had two great days of sun and rain. Kenora Lakes and Dryden Lakes are all open now and we are usually a week plus behind them. I expect in the next week plus a few days if the weather holds we should see a great opener ice free. Pakwash Lake water elevation is in the normal range so far. We haven't had many spring showers as of yet. You can check out the following blog for pictures http://pakwashlakefishing.blogspot.com/
