1304837,keek,2011-05-09 18:33:00,1003,Anybody take their line counter reels to Canada? I'm trying to slim down the number of rods I'll be taking and wondering what you guys take for trolling cranks in 6-10' fow for walleye? I took them last year but just didn't seem to use them. We're bringing our own boat so space isn't really the issue.
1304852,ILScott,2011-05-09 18:58:00,139,I take mine but I fish for lake trout with them. I do use it on my walleye pole but I use bottom bouncers so I feel the bottom better. They are handy to have if you find the fish at a certain depth.
1304884,Yellow Fever,2011-05-09 19:52:00,1809,Don't forget that we are on the metric system here not imperial so you will have to take your reels in to get them changed over for your trip...It's a government thing
1304885,chevtow,2011-05-09 19:54:00,691,HAhahahahahaha! Sure there isn't a tax we could pay instead? LOL
1304913,Pooch,2011-05-09 20:59:00,4619,Lake trout fishing. Probably not really necessary then.....Pooch
1304952,keek,2011-05-10 04:34:00,1003,Well played!
1304964,jdoaks,2011-05-10 05:35:00,89,my wife goes with me and i have a line counter for her if i dont she would keep letting line out until she has 300/400 ft. or snaged.one month to go.
1305044,Lake Wisconsin,2011-05-10 08:34:00,1960,"I do some trolling on boards in CA looking for fish when I first get there. We are usually a little tired from the long drive and kind of put my mind in cruise control. Once we find a few spots with fish, we go back a usually pitch jigs for them. With that in mind, my trolling rods are in my boat. If I was tight on space, they would be the 1st to go."
1305062,Pezman38,2011-05-10 09:18:00,3196,"I bring 4, I have ample room and I set them up with cranks before I go so that if we ever want to troll back to camp we just put those out. Other than that I use a 7' medium fast action with a baitcast reel and let out enough line to continually hit the bottom, in that case line counters don't help."
