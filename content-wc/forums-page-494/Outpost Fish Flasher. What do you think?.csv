1303419,walleye88ia,2011-05-05 19:41:00,35,"Northern Exposure, I had your same problem. Take a roll of gray tape. Make sure the back of the boat is dry. Tape the transducer cord as much as possible as soon as you get there. It might pop off a time or two during the week,but tape it close as possible to the end. It should prevent it from going into the prop. Have a great time!"
1303449,Hawkfan,2011-05-05 20:52:00,237,"I second the Eagle Fishmark 320. Works great, and very convenient. I haven't had an issue with the suction cup for the transducer, but just in case I use the small lenghth of rope that comes with it to tie it to a handle or cleat to keep it out of the prop if it does come off."
1303481,oldblue2008,2011-05-05 21:55:00,313,"That shoelace that comes tied to the transducer suction cup needs to be tied to the back handle of the camp boat, as stated above. About 3 years ago I listened to a guy out on the water telling the other boat that he had just cut his transducer off when it swung into the prop. We have used an X96 portable and older eagles for years up in the bush, and have always tied up the string so there is next to no slack in it, and haven't had a problem. Sometimes you have to experiment with 'ducer location to get it to work better. I always reach down below and feel for the ribs on the bottom of the boat, and try and position it between those, but stuck to the transom."
1303501,SinOrSwim,2011-05-06 04:36:00,1528,"I've been using a portable for 14 or 15 years now and have never had a problem. I use the suction cup on the back of the boat. I don't rely on just the little safety clip that comes on the portable transducer though. I put the suction cup on the boat and then take the cord and make a loop around the handle on the back of the boat and tie it. The cord itselft to the handle. This way if the suction cup comes off it won't go anywhere. There is not enough cord to allow it to reach the prop.Also, just make sure you get the suction cup wet and put it on in the water. It creates a better seal and won't go anywhere."
1303509,Rlcrouse,2011-05-06 05:26:00,286,Had the fishin buddy and I thought it sucked. The screen isn't all that good. Went with the fish eagle and it works great. Used one set of batteries for two weeks of fishing and they were still good. Never had a problem with the transducer coming off.
1303518,rolemac,2011-05-06 06:05:00,6,"to prevent a transducer suction cup from falling off simply coat the inside of the cup with vaseline, you get a really good seal and it prevents the water from getting in and loosening the suction holding the cup, works like a charm and a little tube of vaseline is easy enough to pack along with you"
1303710,NemegosendaRiver,2011-05-06 13:05:00,66,We use a humminbird wide 100 portable. It comes all enclosed with room for the two 6 volt batteries.. The other thing we do is zip-tie some excess transducer cable around a seat bracket or corner handle. It keeps the slack out of the cable and keeps the transducer out of the prop if the suction cup fails (which it will from time to time.)
1304274,SinOrSwim,2011-05-08 12:16:00,1528,"Do NOT, I repeat Do NOT bring a tube of vaseline with you. What if it falls out of your suitcase in front of the group?"
1304282,MOKVIEW,2011-05-08 13:12:00,2,Bass pro carries a portable mounting bracket that for me has been well worth the expense
1304309,rolemac,2011-05-08 15:33:00,6,lol - maybe I better re think that vaseline I always bring on my fly in trips
1303280,smackthewalleyes,2011-05-05 13:14:00,9,"Hello all, just was wondering what everybody thought about buying one of the Humminbird Fishing Buddies for the boats at Canadian outposts. Check the link out below and see what you think. Would this work or would you recommend something else? Has anybody ever used one before?http://www.cabelas.com/portable-sona...uddies-5.shtmlThanks for the replies! First Outpost trip in July can't come quick enough!!"
1303284,Mike Kansas,2011-05-05 13:21:00,1463,"Should work great for you. We have been taking portable depth finders to Canada for years. Make sure you take extra set of batteries. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1303287,Jack77,2011-05-05 13:32:00,168,We have been taking portable fish finders with us to Canada for years also and I can't imagine going without one anymore. The only draw back is that particular model probably will not work when you are moving because of the way it is set up. There are other very nice portable units that the transducer will suction to the back of the boat and can be used all of the time. They also have a bigger screen with more features. Of course they are going to be more expensive but if you are planning on making this an annual trip then the investment would be worth it.
1303302,Northern Exposure,2011-05-05 14:30:00,29,"I have an Eagle Fishmark 320 with the suction cup. It is a good locator but the suction cup tends to fall off every now and then. I also got a small battery for it, like a vexilar battery, and it will last all week on it. Sometimes we forget to turn it off at night and it still last all week. I have had it about 8 years and have had no problems with it and it has taken a pretty good beating from us. I would buy another if this one were to break."
1303313,fosterthedog,2011-05-05 15:03:00,51,"I use an Eagle Fish Easy 350C left over from an old boat. Ive seen the one your looking at and the screen just doesnt look very good. If what the earlier poster wrote about it not working while moving at speed to me its not a fish finder. You can make any fishfinder portable with a suction cup mount, a small piece of plywood(as a base to screw it to),2 6v lantern batteries wired in series(+ of batt1 to - of batt2 with jumper, red wire from fishfinder to + of batt 2 black wire from fishfinder= 12v) I duct tape the two batteries together. Works all week long but I do take an extra set of batteries, also turn the screen backlight down to 0 or off if possible it uses alot of battery power. As was said earlier if you going to make this an annual trip I would try to spend a little more, it will help you catch fish and let you see obstical below the surface. Nothing like going along and seeing your depth go from 45ft to 3ft in about 5-10 yards, makes your hair stand on end. Have a great trip."
1303381,zman8701,2011-05-05 18:22:00,100,"If you should decide to go with a portable, I suggest you buy a transducer bracket right away. The suction cup does not stay on very well. I have been using one for 11 yrs. years now and I""ll never be with out one again."
1303395,bigdaddy66,2011-05-05 18:48:00,7,"I have an old fishing buddy and have used it for many years on camp boats. It does not work at very high speeds, it splashes water into the boat and jumps up and down in the bracket. (not ideal but better than nothing)I bought a portable with a suction cup before last years trip and really liked it. It is also easier to pack and does not take up as much space while traveling.I plan on bringing both this year to have the fishing buddy as a spare in case one of the others has a problem."
1303407,zman8701,2011-05-05 19:14:00,100,I have no problem with water splashing in the boat with this. I use the standard boat bracket model http://www.cabelas.com/product/Porta...h-All+Products
1303412,Pooch,2011-05-05 19:27:00,4619,We carry the little green sanding pads and scrub the area on the transom of a rental boat to rid it of the slim that builds up from being in the water all summer.This has eliminated loosing the suction cup type transducers on portable depth finders. You can also replace the suction cup (if it gets dry rot) with a similar one from a hardware store. I think they are used for automobile roof rack mounts. Ace or Tru-Value have them on their websites.With the transom scoured clean you can move the 'ducer up and down to eliminate the rooster tail when running wide open.Pooch
1303415,Jack77,2011-05-05 19:32:00,168,Thanks for the tip.
