The current operation is in need of lots of work and it would certainly improve our neighborhood to have the place fixed up. Also a better conservation attitude from a new owner would certainly help us all in the NW Ontario area as the owner, not manager, is a real meat seller when it comes to promation etc. Just want the world to know what they are getting into as you and I both know how much work, fun and satisfaction a successful update can bring to you and your family as well as the Outfitting community as a whole."
525332,Guest,2002-11-11 11:32:00,0,THANKS TO EVERYONE. I GUESS HE WILL LOOK AT IT IN THE NEAR FUTURE. COMMENTS HAVE BEEN VERY HELPFULL
525333,Guest,2002-11-12 06:54:00,0,"Neighbor you are exactly right and all the other camp owners are your buddy for the first year or so but the new guy can be more aggressive with promotion,rates or whatever then the new guy is the bad guy I'm sur you seen this."
525321,Guest,2002-11-07 13:55:00,0,can anyone give me information on Timberlane lodge? both the good and the bad. it's for sale and a freind is interested. thanks.....
525322,Guest,2002-11-07 15:24:00,0,"if you are talking about the one outside of ear falls, it is a very basic fishing camp that needs a lot of work. lots of deferred maintenance. where is the listing? i did a search and cannot find it on the internet. how much do they want for it?"

525324,Guest,2002-11-07 15:39:00,0,the listing isn't there yet. i guess. i did not see it.
525325,Guest,2002-11-07 15:49:00,0,"ok, i found it. my guess is that you could take that price and add about 50% to that figure to get it back into shape. some of the cabins are really rough. it would take a handy and young man to take on that task. just my opinion. i would also check the well and septic very carefully."
525326,2 DOGS,2002-11-07 18:44:00,361,"Not far from where I stay, great couple have managed it for past few years. From an outsider's viewpoint it would appear that the owners bled it dry - probably lost customers because of it and now want to unload it. You'd have to fill alot of boat seats and sell alot of minnows to bring it back, let alone pay it off."
525327,Guest,2002-11-08 07:39:00,0,"I bought a camp on Gullrock and had alot of people laugh because I paid to much Now the same people are wanting to buy my place for 3 times what I paid. It take alot of blood, sweat and beer to get a camp in shape.I think timberlane put a septic system in 10yrs. ago."
525328,Guest,2002-11-08 08:48:00,0,"The Septic is about12-15 years old and failling badly do to improper instalation, I know cause I helped previous owner ""touch"" it up for sale to current owner. There is no well they, draw from lake/river; so with current requirements of Min. of Environment, your looking at a well, or water treatment system and a new septic to come up to specs for Min as well as any banker. The cabins are rough and the killer is the worst hill from dock to cabin on the lake. Camp would be a marginal go in Canadian funds let alone what they are asking in US dollars. Lac Seul is a wonderful place but keep both eyes wide open. The comments from 2 Dogs are on the nail, business has left with the best of on site management, go figure."
525329,Guest,2002-11-08 10:02:00,0,"i have stayed there and have no idea what the place is worth. i'd like to see about 5 years of detailed financials before venturing a guess. my group doesn't need much in the area of creature comforts. we go to fish. period. the beds were clean and comfortable, the fridge kept the beer, crawlers and leeches cold. showers were hot. the boats ran fine. enough for us and the price was right. dean was very helpful and pleasant. i am simply stating that there is a lot of deferred maintenance. one day, i thought i smelled an odor of a septic tank in the camp. couldn't say for sure if it was that or the dumpster. i was suspicious of the water because of the color. looked like lake water to me. i think that a few of the cabins are not currently useable because of their condition. and yes neighbor, that ****ed hill can be rough after a 10 hour day on the water."
525330,Guest,2002-11-11 06:42:00,0,Don you might want to take some of these comments with a grain of salt they could be from other camp owners on LS that don't want someone buying and fixing the place up.
