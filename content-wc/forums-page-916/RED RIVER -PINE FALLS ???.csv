525267,Cranky,2002-10-31 20:00:00,13,"The launch past the mill is still good unless we get snow ,it has ntbeen used much in the last week and a half because of poor weather.The nets are off the lake and bay and if the weather holds out the fishing should be good. Water temp yesterday was 37.5 F ."
525268,Guest,2002-10-31 20:42:00,0,"Hey Stinger,My suggestion to you for this upcoming weekend would be too head north to Pine Falls. Simply put, the Red is starting to make some serious ice along the shoreline. Aswell, hugh expanses of the main river is also making ice. Were tentatively planing one last trip for tomorrow on the Red. The forecasted low for this local tonight is another cool -10 degree's. Were not holding our breath regarding tomorrows chances."

The largest 'eye was 28 inches.Ice was not even an issue for us, thanks to the slightly warmer temps. today.Caught all our fish in 18 feet over rocks. 1/4 0z. pink & white bucktail tipped with a salty."
525270,Guest,2002-11-01 18:43:00,0,"Thanks Cat ""illac"" man. You just made up my mind for fishing on the red tommorow. I was going to put the boat away for the year but would just love to fish that one last time."
525271,Ron,2002-11-01 20:43:00,387,"Stu....Thanks for the update. Had a great day two weekends ago, but due to work commitments I have been unable to get out since. Had thoughts of trying one last time this Sunday, so if the weather co-operates and the ice stays away, we may see you out there??? If not, a huge thanks for the upgraded boat launch this year, and we may see you on the ""ice"".Ron"
525272,gms,2002-11-03 08:22:00,91,"Fished Pine Falls Saturday November 2, 2002- Action is still extremely slow despite the fact that we boated a 26"" and 27"" walleye (both back in the water for the next lucky contestant), 2 small greenbacks and a sauger. That was fishing from 8am - 3pm. All were caught jigging chaurtreuse jigs.- Conditions - Light NE wind, very little current, 32F- Nets in Traverse Bay are gone (as far as I could see), water is cold.- Did see one boat (Sylvan - ND registration) doing quite well anchored."
525273,stinger,2002-11-06 20:38:00,7,"any word on PF, its supposed to go to +5 c on Friday and wondering what the launches are like.looks like the red river is out as ice is forming quickly with the low current/water levelslove to try PF one more time this year !thanks,"
525274,Guest,2002-11-07 16:41:00,0,"Red River has open up today due to the warm weather. the walleyes are sitting in the deep pockets. Active eyes in the shallows. 4-10' range.try fishing north of selkirk past sugar island to the left shore line going north. caught some hogs hiding bye the pillers under the bridge to no where. Dip your minnows in soya sauce for the best action. to date our biggest this year is 15.6 lbs. lots of 29-31"".Try dragging bottom very slowly with 3/8 oz. green and chartruse odd ball jigs. Throw all cranks in the crapper. good luck and mail me, let me know how u made out. Big Al"
