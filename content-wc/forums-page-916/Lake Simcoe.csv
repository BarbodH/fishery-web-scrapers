525195,Guest,2002-10-24 18:56:00,0,Cooks Bay and the area behind the islands is hot for perch.The main body of the lake is mainly whitefish and lakers.
525196,BGunn,2002-10-26 05:40:00,880,"Read the info on this board:http://216.40.250.71/boards/board.cgi?user=LakeSimcoeGet a good map of the lake, and mark the spots they are talking about.Last year Cooks was not as good as it has been other years, but Snake Island was ok on certain days.Best to go with your own gear, and hut, and a 4 wheeler, than to be stuck in a nonproductive guides hut all day. Not that you won't do good in a guides hut, some days you can limit out pretty easy. The guides do their best to put you on fish. It's just that with your own gear, you can move around to find the fish if they have moved around.I've seen days when 20' made all the difference in the world for ice fishing for Perch.Have a good trip,Bill"
525197,Guest,2002-10-26 17:32:00,0,"Simcoe ice fishing is best for whitefish. Lots of lakers as well and some good perch fishing to be had. The big lake and towards the islands for Lakers and whitfish, and Cooks Bay for perch. Lots of crappy as well and I have a great spot for winter Walleye.Last year was kinda messed up as the big part of the lake never even froze (I never seen this happen before) , but if it freeze's like normal this year it should be an awesome season.Good Luck!"
525198,Guest,2002-11-04 13:24:00,0,"I haved fished Simcoe quite often (whitefish and Lakkers) and my advice is this, don't use a guide hut. Bring a 4 wheeler, a map and move around. Talk to poeple and ask info cause most of the locals are realy friendly. My best trip there was when I asked a local baitshop owner (Barrie)if he knew a local who always does well to bring me out for a fee and a tip."
525199,Guest,2002-11-06 13:16:00,0,Manny I'll take you out for free.I'll assume you asked Simcoe Bait & Tackle........ I hate that guys wife..... what a #####!!Anyways.. if your after Lakers and Whitefish this winter let me know as I go out just about every day and your welcome to tag along.
