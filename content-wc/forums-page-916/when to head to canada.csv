525319,Guest,2002-11-11 06:23:00,0,I would recommend going to Canada when ever you can and as many times as possible.
525309,RCKC,2002-11-05 10:28:00,14,"When do you guys like to go up to canada and why. We've always gone in June. Debating to go in August, any replys appreciated."
525310,Riceburner,2002-11-05 10:47:00,436,"IN GENERAL,It depends on where you're headed, and how deep you like to fish.....(ASSUMING WALLEYES IN A LAKE), June is typically a shallower bite, with active fish, tho they may be smaller (after the pre-spawn bite). July still good--but fish are moving away from the spawning areas to deeper water. August can be slower during warm water-but fish are starting to hit the midlake humps. The Sept and Oct bite can be fantastic for large fish--they are chowing down for the cold water season and spawn....THIS IS ""IN GENERAL""---I'd recommend asking about a specific fishery--you will get the BEST HELP ANYWHERE-right here on WC !!!"
525311,Peanut,2002-11-05 12:37:00,929,"Where I come from (Saskatchewan) June is considered the month with the hottest bite, and Sept./Oct. the best chance for the biggest fish.That does not mean they shut off in July or August, but you may have to work a little harder, and even at that there may be some days where there's not much action.As posted, however, these generalities can vary greatly depending on where you are fishing.derrek.""I'll teach these eyes to see,beyond these walls in front of me""- Bruce Springsteen, ""Trapped"""
525312,Northern Manitoban,2002-11-05 12:55:00,195,"Peanut is right.Here in Manitoba June is the month to catch the trophy fish,walleyes,lakers,etc.My biggest trips of the year are in june and end of september early october.These are the times to catch your fish of a lifetime.I have found august to be not very good for walleyes where i fish,as for lakers i can catch them plentyful all summer.But spring is the best time.FISH ON."

525317,eyedoktr,2002-11-08 07:05:00,2426,The only time I like to go to Canada (Bay of Quinte) is from the end of October until the end of February. There are alot of places to catch good numbers of walleye year 'round but this time of yeat at Quinte you can get good numbers of huge walleye. Plus I love ice fishing!!!
