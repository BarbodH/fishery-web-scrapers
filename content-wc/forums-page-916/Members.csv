525290,Guest,2002-11-09 17:52:00,0,"No sh t:Tourist camps are offered for sale in Canada. Canadians have at least as much opportunity to buy these properties as Americans do. If Americans buy them - so what?The owners are not living off the exchange. They are living off the income they made at the going market rate. If they charged in Canadian $, they would simply charge more.If you want to buy property in Canada or the USA, you can - check the real estate listings.If you have further urges to vent your anti-American sentiments, take up kick boxing or try one of the web sites that seemm to cater to negative viewpoints.New member - this site is usually not filled by people with no sh t's attitude."
