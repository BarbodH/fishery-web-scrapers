525212,Northern Manitoban,2002-10-31 15:25:00,195,"Grassy river lodge on Reed lake Manitoba,or Peterson's lodge,or the campground there.All on this great Lake in Manitoba.And they have fly outs from here also.Its a drive to lake.In my opinion probably the best drive to lake for pike over 40 inches,walleyes over 29 inches and lakers over 35 inches in Manitoba.I fish this lake and its is incredible place to go in the month of june and early july.Plus if you decide to drive there.There are other lakes close by that you can catch trophy pike and walleye's.But i only do that if i get blown off of Reed.And the Northern lights are awesome at night when the sun goes down about midnight.Well i know i'll be there next year! FISH ON."
525200,Randy,2002-10-24 21:01:00,53,It would be great to get about 30 of the WC gang together at one Resort for a week next summer....what a tournament that could be....
525201,eyewitness,2002-10-24 21:25:00,680,What area of the country are you referencing?
525202,Randy,2002-10-25 06:08:00,53,Ontario or Manitoba would be my suggestion. The hardest part would probably be getting a Resort on a Lake that would have enough fish to handle 30 of the top Walleye fisherman in the world.
525203,Walleye Wacker,2002-10-25 06:42:00,6,This would be a great idea. We need to get a Resort owner who could accomadate a group of this size and start getting some deposits sent to him. Come own guys lets do it. Does anybody have a resort in mind???
525206,Reels,2002-10-25 14:06:00,2876,"Sounds like fun, keep me in the loop.<{{}}><"
525207,AL,2002-10-25 16:18:00,89,I vote for Okogi Reservoir with Mattice Lake Outfitters. They can handle a group of 30 on this body of water.
525204,chrism,2002-10-25 23:27:00,429,I'm up for that - I'll check out a few places....
525205,Dan,2002-10-26 07:17:00,325,Sounds real good.Fly-in or drive-in? Housekeeping or do we want to have access to prepared meals?What time of year?
525208,Guest,2002-10-27 05:51:00,0,"Red Indian Lodge on LOW. Prices are decent if you bring your own boat and a big enough lake to challenge the participants. They can handle close to 100 people and when I stayed there in August, they had enough vacancy that they could have handled 30 people."
525209,Babamel,2002-10-27 09:50:00,0,"I think it would be a great opportunity to meet others and learn from each other. I would defininitly be interested in being a part of it. a few issues I think would need to be addressed:1. The makeup of cabin partners. I am sure there would be drastically different expectations, especially concerning evening hours, some that want to have a quiet time, have a drink or two, maybe a round of cards, then retire. Others who could be more inclided to have more than a few drinks, brink their boom boxes, and keep the noise going well into the night. Somehow cabin assignments could need some consideration. 2. Cabin chores. Those who like a neat cabin and are the type that take initiative to keep things neat and tidy could get frustrated with others who ""never see what needs to be done."" 3. If meals are to be prepared by the group, Menu planning would need to be addressed, especially if there are those who have special dietary needs. camps with a restraunt would facilitate this, but would raise the price considerably. If each cabin does its own cooking, the group could decide that each person was responsible for one evening meal and the person brings what is needed to make it."
