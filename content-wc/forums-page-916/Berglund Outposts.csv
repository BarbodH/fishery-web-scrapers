Send them an email and ask for references from their customers (including the customers phone numbers). If I like a place I allow them to use me as a reference. There is an email link at their site http://www.berglundoutposts.com/ I looked over their website. The rates seem to be fair considering fishing boats and motors are included, and the cabins look to be well kept. Have you fished in the Ignace area before? If you would like more info on the fishing in that part of the English River system leave me a message (click the second (?) icon at the top right of this post)."
