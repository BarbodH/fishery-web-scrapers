524985,Guest,2002-10-19 04:13:00,0,"A little pricey for my wallet. Even though they have the American Plan, I think their food is bland. Try http://www.pickerelarm.com,access to same lake but better cabins and a whole lot cheaper. Housekeeping only so you'll have to fix your own meals. My wife and I have been going there for 10 years and she won't go anywhere else."

If you go the full american plan, you will fish a number of different lakes and species of fish. I have stayed at their lodge on one occasion, always go into their outposts, which is up on Lac Seul. Hope this helps! Highly recommend it.eyesnatcher"
524988,ohdaddy,2002-11-04 17:35:00,21,"Been going to Andersons for 5 years now. Our group has fished 5 lakes and 9 resorts in 33 years. Andersons by far is the best camp we have ever stayed at not to mention outstanding fishing. They are 1st class all the way. The money means nothing if your staying at a second class resort with poor fishing. We will never look elsewhere for my Canadian vaction. How many camps don't need or go to fishing shows for new business? Not many. Anderson's repeat business fills there camp every year. Book your trip with them and you'll be very glad you did. Some people don't have the means to go first class to canada, but if you can.....then do it. ohdaddykeep your pole in the water and line stiff!"
524989,Todd_NE,2002-11-05 07:26:00,1330,"I and a pal fished Anderson's a few years ago and it was fantastic. By far the best run camp I've ever been to. The guides are great, it's easy to find, the food at the main camp was very good, the guides did a great job with shore lunch or whatever you want (if you tire of fish ""ha"" they will cook other foods, the spots they have on islands are perfect and even have rough ""facilities"", plus their outposts are in a great spot on Lac Seul with good fishing. We caught walleye, perch, and pike. I think in the future I'd fish more pike up there - holy smokes is that good pike fishing.I'm not someone who can tell you all the intricacies of who charges more, less, this is included, this isn't included, etc. I just go by the people I meet and the fishing I have. For my one trip to Anderson's - that's all - it was topnotch and I will go back one day.ToddYup, got her... feel that head shake!"
524990,Ivy,2002-11-05 09:30:00,556,What did you spend ( about ) for a week? Ivy

524992,Ivy,2002-11-05 13:23:00,556,"Thanks. So, you went to their Out-post on Lac Seul? Ivy"
524993,Todd_NE,2002-11-05 15:09:00,1330,"Ivy,I was there with a fellow named Rhett Eckmann and we stayed at the main camp south of Sioux Lookout and fished one day at the lake the lodge is on, one day on a lake for lake trout and smallies (I forget the name) and two days on Lac Seul. We just drove to nearby launches. We had Rhett's boat and followed a guide in a boat out one day and a guide went with us the next on Lac Seul. We fished out in the area where their outposts were and saw them from the water - we did not go in them though they looked like they were in excellent repair. I cannot vouch for the outposts on the inside.I was amazed at the rocks coming up to the top in 50' of water, scared the bejeezus out of me.I'd love to go back. It was beautiful and wayyyyy out there. We really nailed the eyes on minnows and slayed the pike with little cleo's and Mann's -1's. We also caught perch on small jigs wherever we found some sand and weeds, timber, etc.Yup, got her... feel that head shake!"
