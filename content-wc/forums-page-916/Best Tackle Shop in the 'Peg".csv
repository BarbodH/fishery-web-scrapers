525346,Northern Manitoban,2002-11-07 22:33:00,195,"Go to Army surplus downtown or Pro-Am tackle.Don't waist your time at The fishing hole,they still have empty hooks and shelves.Its been like that for years there,i keep being told they are just out of stock.Little tired of hearing that for years now.SIR isn't to bad but they are pricey."

In the city there's D & R tackle on Main, I get a bit of a discount there because he knows my boss, but overall, a poor place to shop. Next to no selection. Owner runs the place with no employees and always tries to talk you into the stuff he makes the most money on.Ernies gun and tackle, I've never checked the place out, but guys I know go there exclusively.The fishin hole. knowledgable staff, reasonable prices, nothing cheap.United Army surplus. good prices and selection,Pro Am, went there in my late teens and was eyed like I was going to steal somthing, so I never went back. Although lots of people like it.SIR, reasonable selection, high prices, un-knowledgable staff."
