525224,Guest,2002-10-29 20:11:00,0,"It appears that you want outpost fishing. You could also boat in or flyin to a resort. Fishing pressure is much less than drive to resorts. Cascade Camp next to Cascade Falls at far north end of Rainy Lake can be reached by flyin or boat in (camp operator makes arrangements for boat to all you, your gear and food.) Fishing off the dock gave me the best smallmouth fishing I have ever had when I went 3 years ago-end of July, early August. This is an older basic fishing camp. The wiring is visable and you can see the 2 x 4s that support the cabin and siding. It has indoor plumbing, stove, refrigerator (rusty on the outside, but functional) plus an outdoor propane grill. Daily rates and functional boats and motors (15 hp). If budget is a primary concern or you need to coordinate fishing with airline schedules, this bears looking into."

Absolutely,without question the best smallmouth fishing I have ever had. Three over six pounds, all released. Caviar is loaded with smallies and under fished cause nobody knows about it. Well do yourself a favor and learn. Maps at baitshop in Sioux Narrows. Two camps on lake, but prefer to make day trips. Aaron, I don't know anymore than what I see here except that this is a ""remote"" lake in the respect that you cannot drive to it. You can travel various lake systems to get there and avoid the added costs of flying in. I believe there is a camp on the lake...Jim's Caviar Lake Camp or something. Look into it, make some phone calls if this falls into your geographic search area. laterTom"

525228,Guest,2002-10-30 18:28:00,0,"Have to agree with reply #1 Kashabowie and #4, Canoe Canada. Have used both about 3-4 times each and would use either again. Cabins and equipment at both outfitters usually excellent. I thought the fishing was good. Both outfitters have several lakes but not all lakes have smallies. Ask first. Most lakes you are the only cabin. Both are located about 2 hours east of Ft. Frances/Int. Falls or 2 hrs. west of Thunder Bay. Take the Thunder Bay route if you can to save hassle and time. Good fishing."
