Its been a long time since I have seen it mentioned as a good place to fish. Has it declined or have people just been focused more on the Red and Winnipeg Rivers?"
525303,Guest,2002-11-04 18:37:00,0,I fished there for about 5 years now and I think this will be my last year. The fishing has declined.
525304,Guest,2002-11-05 09:54:00,0,"I'd have to agree. The Narrows does every now and then kick out a good fish or two but not anywhere near in terms of numbers to what it used to be. Commercial lake fishermen stock the daylights out of the lake and they are limited by quota. Other nets, however are not regulated and this is part of the problem (in my opinion) with regards to the lack of larger fish in the system. I've been told that commercial fishermen on Lake Winnipegosis are also having problems with numbers. It might just be a cyclical thing as we've heard Carl Wall (lead Manitoba Conservation biologist) explain in another post about the Red and Winnipeg rivers this year..... but how long do these cycles last and when was the last time that real hard scientific data was collected (and by whom?). Manitoba has a lot of work to do to improve the recreational side of its fisheries. If only they would see the benefit I believe they might do more than they are and can do at the moment."
525305,walleyedude,2002-11-05 17:47:00,34,By other nets would you be referring to Native subsistence netting?Just asking.....
