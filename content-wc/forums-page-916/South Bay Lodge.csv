525340,Guest,2002-11-10 14:31:00,0,"Looks like the word is out! We have owned the lodge now for 8 years. We purchased it with the plan to improve the operations, improve the fishing, improve our lifestyles and sell in 10 years. It is not an old man's occupation. We love it at the lodge and after selling we will always return to South Bay Lodge, but we do not want to work the rest of our lives either. I'm 48 and came from a career with the same company for 18 years until they gave me money to go away, so I did! We have reached our goals with the lodge operations and has been better than we dreamed. Kay, my wife, misses being with our daughter who is now in 4th year of architecture school and she misses her friends/family during the summer. We just feel ready to move on to our next big adventure! We have done an unbelievable amount of work to the log cabins, docks, lodge, etc...more importantly, the fishing quality is better now than it ever has been (according to the old-timers who have been comin to the lodge for 40yrs.) It is a unique operation being the only lodge on 14,000 acres with millions of acres of remote bush and lakes surrounding us. I am looking forward to returning to the lodge and being a guest instead of the host. ro"
