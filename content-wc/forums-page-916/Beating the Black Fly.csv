The Beaver Pee actually has the same effect as the Tampon, you just don't have all the extra work of getting a fire started.One word of caution, if you get the Beaver Pee in your eye, you could get the rickets.IvyFish-on! Put down that beer and get the net!"

I know to cover up, but are there any remedies the ""grandma"" talked about, that will help reduce the time spent avoiding the BEAST! Thanks for any help! Still itching!!"
525292,Guest,2002-11-03 08:11:00,0,Muskol insect repellent. Accept no substitute.
525293,jerry,2002-11-03 19:23:00,966,go up in july or later.
525294,Guest,2002-11-04 13:26:00,0,Been going to Canada for 20 years and the best way to avoid them is to go up when they aren't there......either early or late. If you decide to fight them you absolutely have to get a few cans of ULTRA-Thon....it's made by 3M. By far the best defense against black flies I have ever used....and I've use them all.
525295,Guest,2002-11-05 14:23:00,0,"i live in canada. we have a tonne of black flies, and yes the best would have to be Muskol. the only problem with that is black flies love to burrow up in your hair line. it help to wear a hat!"
525296,Riceburner,2002-11-05 18:00:00,436,I had written down from a long ago post here---try Lemon scent JOY dishwashing soap--let it dry on. I haven't tried it--but worth buying a bottle just in case....
525297,Guest,2002-11-05 20:05:00,0,If you want to try this;take moose dropings and smear the juice on your body-face.Also you can take a slightly soiled tampon and hang that by the campfire. hope it works.stu the woodsman
