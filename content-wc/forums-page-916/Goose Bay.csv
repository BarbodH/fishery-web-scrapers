524536,aaron,2002-10-29 16:53:00,6,"Don't tell me ""bigfish""got outfished by a drunk woman,maybe i would be turning to rehab also.You can say whatever you want about me,but i dont have to throw low blows to hide the real truth,you have to feeling prety low being outdone by a drunk!Ivy dont worry about it people who try to give advise to others usually have problems of there own.Is it because you turned him down?oris the fact he was outangled."
524537,Guest,2002-10-30 07:05:00,0,"Aaron,Big Fish and I have been friends for over 30 years. We have fished, hunted and been in more scrapes than I can remember He can poke fun at me and I can of him. You can't. Also, a bit of friendly advice. Take your High School studies a little more seriously. I would suggest a English /Spelling tutor. Poor grammer and bad spelling are a window to your intelligenceSet the hook and get net!Ivy"
524538,Guest,2002-10-30 08:13:00,0,Bigfish and Ivy I wish you would of had a bad time at my camp and I was getting all the free advertising that Goose Bay and Lac Suel is.
524539,Guest,2002-10-30 08:17:00,0,I agree. This thread has taken on a life of it's own. I'm curious though .Where is it?Ivy
524540,Guest,2002-10-30 15:48:00,0,Ivy I got to respect the wishes of this forum as a camp owner I will not promote my place on this site. If someone else dose so be it if you would like to call me my # is 1-888-875-1859.
524541,Guest,2002-11-02 20:45:00,0,"Ivy,A little bit of friendly advice your way. Before you criticize my grammar and spelling, maybe you ought to take a closer look at yours first. At least I can spell the word grammar! I would perhaps suggest an (not a) English/Spelling Tutor for you as well! Maybe I can connect you with mine! A few of your other messages I read through also had some grammar and spelling errors. Two words: PROOF READ!I see women like you once in a while in Northwestern Ontario all decked out in camouflage with asses as wide as an axe handle, talking about all the fish they supposedly caught.Whatever BEOTCH!Aaron"

You see, it has been over 25 years since I was in High School and admittedly I am out of touch with you M.T.V ebonic youth. Personally, I blame it on that gangster rap music. So young and yet so angry.Now go out and get fishing. You crazy scamp.Word up dog. (Or something like that.)Ivy"

524526,Otts,2002-10-28 17:39:00,119,"I fished there last year for the first time. Hate to admit it, but I was in the same fishing party as Rock. We arrived early and did not expect our cabin to be ready. We expected to drop the boat in, go fishing, and then return to a clean cabin. We were fortunate that the cabin was ready when we got there. We were in a small cabin. It was nothing fancy by all means. I believe the larger cabins are a lot nicer. But we were happy. We bought a lake map from Andrea, and she highlighted places for us to fish both walleye and pike. We ventured out on our own and found the spots. I have to admit we were lost a couple of times, but thank goodness we had a GPS with us. I would not venture to far from camp with out a GPS. After we got back the first day, Andrea helped us figure out where we were that day. Once we knew where we were, that understanding of the lake helped us to scout other areas. The first day was overwhelming, but once we found a couple of ""honey holes"" we had great fishing. It would be nice if the lake map had longitude and latitude on them, because that would make finding things a lot easier. Andrea was a good host. We got what we expected. Excellent fishing and a place to eat and sleep. She visited with us when we were on the front porch but otherwise left us to ourselves. Nothing wrong with that. If we expected to be catered to hand and foot, I know we would have picked the wrong camp. Would a guide have been nice? Maybe. Andrea tells you all of the good spots that are by camp. Once you get close to them you will usually see another boat there fishing already. And don't be afraid to try something that looks good that was not highlighted on the map. Heading back to Goose Bay again in June. I hope this trip will be the same as the first.Otts"
524527,MNStarfish,2002-10-29 07:56:00,32,"I also stayed at Goose Bay , and had a similar experience as Otts.Andrea was helpful , friendly, and went out of her way to help us with anthing we needed. Cabins were not fancy, but they were exactly what we were looking for. I plan on going back with my Dad next summer."
524528,Guest,2002-10-29 09:21:00,0,"Otts and Starfish,Sounds like you guys had a great time. I wish we had the same experience. How far East did you go? Did you go past Mc Kenzie? We had heard Mc Kenkie was THE place to catch walleye. The day our guide showed up he was going to take us to Sunlight Lake. He said that is where we would catch a lot of Walleyes this time of year. We never got past Big Island. The chop was 3 and 4 feet. What a ride! As we tried to go across that bay ( twice ), I was thinking about the Edmund Fitzgerald for some reason. Since I was wearing my Duck hunting coat and pants I was never cold. However the spray in my face was numbing and effervecent! And I was thinking I'll be swimming before the end of the day.Does anyone know if there are out-post cabins on or around Mc Kenzie Bay? Ivy"
524529,Otts,2002-10-29 10:14:00,119,"Ivy, First, we fished in early June. Second, I'm sure that if our stay would have been as displeasing we would not be returning there either. We took off for McKensie Bay the first day. Andrea suggested the sandbanks there. When we got to the bay it was HUGE! We had no idea where the sandbanks where. We basically were confused as to where we were. Like I said, thank God we had a GPS with us. We ended up in the far north end of the bay fishing an inlet. Because it was an inlet, we were after pike. The pike fishing didn't last long though. Before we knew it, we were catching really nice walleyes on daredevils. We couldn't believe it! It was an awesome day of fishing! We never went further east than McKensie Bay either. After that, most of our fishing was up in Sawmill. Sawmill is about half of the drive that Mckensie was. Our best fishing came from a shorline that Andrea hadn't marked on the map. We didn't dicover the river fishing until the end. We had no idea that the river went back in that far. Once we started discovering it, we saw plenty of boats up in there fishing. The reason they were fishing it was because it was close to camp and the lake had some big waves on it. One time coming out of Sawmill the waves were huge also. We were in a bassboat! We put put all the gear away and took our time getting back to camp. Now that was a ride. None of were dry. The lake maps for Lac Suel are huge. Definately buy one and have the camp owner mark fishing spots for you. Go out and investigate the spots. I can gaurantee you, that you will get turned around up there fishing. Have a GPS with you. We will be bringing a backup one for our trip this year. When you get back after a day of fishing sit down with the camp owner to figure out where you were (if you were confused like us).Otts"
524530,MNStarfish,2002-10-29 10:29:00,32,"We were there the first week of July. We also fished McKensie Bay, on the sandbanks. Did very well on the sand banks on small walleyes. It took us 1 hour to get there on the way there, the wind picked up and it took us 2.5 hours to get back, got lost once. Spent the rest of the time closer to camp, high winds all week. Did great the last day fishing in 4 feet of water!"
524531,Ivy,2002-10-29 13:14:00,556,"We had a rented camp boat. And that is what we are used to when we go to Canada. However we had never been to the Lac before. We had high winds as well. It became kind of a vicious cycle when we were out there. It was cold and windy and wet. So of course we had to have a few Labatt's (every once and a while)to help ease the crappy conditions. And everytime you went anywhere you would get jarred around. Truly, I think I bruised my Gall bladder on one hike. And speaking of bladders all that bouncing and Labaat's made for quite the ordeal between the longjohns, jeans and rain pants. Not to mention a rocking boat. After the fiasco with the guide, we decided to do a fly-out. We did a fly-out from the service around the corner from Goose Bay. We went to Oak lake. We had a great time. we caught a lot of Northern and some nice size Walleye. It kind of saved the trip. Ivy"
524532,Guest,2002-10-29 13:40:00,0,IvyWere you the one who was in our party and drunk all week? It made the fishing much more difficult with and your little friend singing Irish drinking songs and following our boat around the lake.Bigfish
524533,Guest,2002-10-29 13:58:00,0,"Big Fish,Man you made me laugh! I was having my typical afternoon snack of milk and cookies when I read your note. I laughed so hard I shot milk out of nose. I tell you what though. A month of re-hab has made you kind of mean. I liked it better when you drank all day. Ivy"
524534,Guest,2002-10-29 14:10:00,0,IvyO.K. your right about the re-hab. But at least I have come out of the closet and admitted that I have a problem and begun to deal with it head on. You would be well advised to reveal your problems and start to live a clean life.Bigfish

As I read your note I heard a cry for help that could be heard nort of Red Lake Eh!Ivy likey the Labatt's. Ivy likey the the Crown Royal. Besides it quites all those voices in my head. And don't make me go into who caught the biggest fish on the trip stuff."
524516,Guest,2002-10-21 14:03:00,0,"mp 3553, Now your a man with a real problem...your wife doesent like to fish ?? Some of us would think this a stroke of luck....a nice day on the lake with no ""Honeydews"" and a hot supper and a warm heart waiting for you at the cabin....no wonder you like Goose Bay....My wife loves to fish and she takes great pride in stomping my heart out every time she catchs more or bigger fish than me....she is also smart enough to have a new life jacket and have it on during those harrasing moments....and she beats me with all my own fishing equipment....community property laws stink."
524517,Guest,2002-10-21 14:18:00,0,why is a guide needed on LS if it's caaled a fish factory the fish should be everywhere.This is nothing more than a ?
524518,Walleye Wacker,2002-10-21 15:27:00,6,"Ted, its true lac Seul is a Walleye factory. However fisherman who dont have adequate lake knowledge might find it hard to locate HOTSPOTS and as big as Lac Seul is they might find it hard to get home. lac Seul can be a dangerous lake for the novice fisherman with its many prop buster rocks that seem to pop up and ruin a good day. I also know several fisherman who enjoy fishing with a good Guide because you can learn something every day on the water some good some bad."
524519,Guest,2002-10-22 09:47:00,0,"Great Advice. We heard so many great things about Lac Seul we didn't want to waste anytime fumbeling around with-out a guide. And after we got on the lake "" Largest Man Made Lake in Norh America or so we were told "" we saw the need for a guide right away. I am looking forward to getting back there. Just at a different camp.Ivy"
524520,Guest,2002-10-24 13:02:00,0,"Ivy and BigfishI really question your thinking that a guide is needed. Andrea, the owner at Goose Bay, sits down with each group and maps out many great fishing spots. My group had never been to Canada before and I can't imagine catching any more fish by using a guide. My group is going back again to Goose Bay next summer. Did you ever think that maybe your group whined about every little thing and she has enough business without you? Just a thought."
524521,Ivy,2002-10-24 14:37:00,556,"Yo Rock Guy,You were there in mid-summer. We were there at the end of September. The fishing conditions were far different. Anyway, I am not sure I follow you. You have a good experience and we don't, so we are whining? Reminds me of the Private and his Sergeant who jumped out of a plane during a military exercise. The Private opens his parachute, no problems. He is enjoying the ride down. The Sergeant jumps 20- seconds later and his parachute doesn't open. On his way past the Private, he screams that the guy who packed his shoot is #$%#$$% jerk. The Private thinks to himself, that the Sergeant is nuts, his shoot opened just fine, what a whiner.I am not going slam Andrea. Life is to short to carry a grudge. We just would never go back to Goose Bay for all the reasons previously listed. And it's kind of a pointless argument anyway. Bigfish was passing along information to the rest of the Walleye fishing team. Some people like yourselves had a good experience at her camp. If someone is thinking about going to Goose Bay they have a couple of view points.Ivy"
524522,Guest,2002-10-24 14:39:00,0,"Rock,One other thing. By the 3rd day we were the only people in Camp. Ivy"
524523,Guest,2002-10-24 18:21:00,0,"FYIBy mid Sept the ""fishing season"" is about over.I hope your this post slows the business down... getting real hard to get a cabin for 2 weeks in June anymore!"
524524,Guest,2002-10-25 14:18:00,0,What would be the best time to fish Lac Seul? Ivy
524525,Guest,2002-10-27 20:35:00,0,"I prefer early June and early Sept. Temps are usually in the 60-70 range for both the water and air. Usually have great fishing during both periods. Have been up twice in July and did well but the heat was a factor the last trip. Sept is probally my favorite due to the fall colors and the reduction of fishermen. Would do 2 weeks in Sept, but the wife ""thinks"" it is colder in Sept? She forgot about the snow storm 2 years ago in the middle of June! Go figure!!Have been up the second week of Sept and was the only boat out fishing from GB. The first week is more busy due to Labor day."
524506,Guest,2002-10-04 14:33:00,0,"We stayed at Goose Bay last year and we had the best fishing we ever had on Lac Suel and we have fished the lake five other years. The camp was clean,the cabin wasn't fancy but Anderia gave it that womans touch that most male run camps don't think of. I know that she doesn't have a guide on staff and I'd bet she did everything she could to find you one. When we got there she gave us a map then showed us some hot spots and we figured out how to catch walleyes. I know we spent a little more time on Lac Suel than what you did but a guide just isn't needed. Sorry you didn't have a good trip but after being at Goose Bay Camp and knowing the owner I find it hard to believe it was as bad as you say. Jeff"
524507,Guest,2002-10-14 13:30:00,0,i have stayed at goose bay and whitewing resort. i thought whitewing was much better with nicer cabins. but the fishing was as usual great at either place.
524508,Guest,2002-10-15 18:11:00,0,The fish come from the same lake @ either camp!LoL
524509,Guest,2002-10-15 19:50:00,0,"after reading aaron's comments.i'm done listening to him.the lodge that he recruits for,well their info is now in the trash.i don't think people think that because they spend their money that anybody owes them anything. i think i just want an honest effort and service something even close to my moneys worth."
524510,Guest,2002-10-16 14:42:00,0,"I've stayed at Goose Bay two years ago. They provided just about everything promised. The only glitch was that we had a storm that knocked the power out and they couldn't pump gas. In addition, all there minnows croaked. However, that was well beyond their control. I would return to Goose, without hesitation. I have also been to Golden Fawn and Evergreen and would give them good marks for service and accomodations. Chamberlin Narrows is a good place that is improving all the time. You can't beat the fishing at CN. TGG"
524511,Guest,2002-10-17 12:19:00,0,"It's interesting to listen to all the different takes on my bad experience at this camp. Great advice Aaron - why not stay out of the conversation if you've never been to the camp. It's great that others have had good experiences at the camp, all I can report on is my trip.Bigfish"
524512,Guest,2002-10-17 19:13:00,0,"In the past 17+ trips to LS, have stayed @ GB camp at least 16 times. Can't remember anytime Andrea hasn't treated me well. Other guests have made my trips very interesting due to their ignorance and lack of respect for other's property. Many times Andrea has asked me to help new guests locate fish because they are to proud/on a limited budget/or no guides avalible. Don't mind helping others since many previous guests have helped me. Even have been known to take people out! She does this for what reason? To make the trip enjoyable for her new guests. Without repeat business, most camps would have a difficult time surviving. Knowing Andrea for 8+ years, really can't imagine her not making a sincere effort in meeting your needs. Did you consider that the prior guest might have stayed longer than expected, possibly you and your group arrived early or maybe the cleaning staff was short workers? How about the orginal ""guide"" being sick? Point is, I'm confident that if you rationally spoke to her or any owner about your camp concerns, they would be addressed and rectified.If not, you are not required to frequent said resort if you choose to do so. Maybe this isn't the camp for you??? For my sake, I hope many of you stay away! It is really getting hard to schedule my 2 week trip in the spring! :)"
524513,Guest,2002-10-18 06:20:00,0,I guess my standards are just a little higher. The guide was a drunk and was 2 days late. Which the owner told us. The cabin not being ready was because the previous group did not leave on time. The owner told us it would be ready in the morning. There was garbage outside our cabin for 2 days from the previous renters. Now I understand that all this could be the fault of a lousy guide and a lack of good help. But as a business owner I also realize that I am ultimately responsible to satisfy my customers. Blaming the help is not an adequate excuse.Bigfish
524514,Guest,2002-10-18 09:40:00,0,"Interesting reading on Goose Bay. I was also in the group with Big Fish. I think it all boils down to the fact that the host could have done more to treat us better, but chose not to.1. When we arrived at the camp ( after driving all night ) our Cabin was not ready. that was a disappointment. O.K. more the fault of the lazy S.O.B.'s than the camp host but the bottom line we were inconvenienced. And the host knew it.2. After that, we were given the news that our guide would not make it for our 2nd day at Camp. But we were assured that if guide #1 didn't show guide #2 would be there. "" I promise"" says the the host 3. Guess what? Bad things happen in 3's. The promises made by our host were worthless. No guide for day #3. 4. Day #4 guide shows up. Host wants him to go in our rented boat with our #30 engine. Given the weather this would have been a real problem. 3' and 4' shop in a loaded boat would be a bad deal. It was only after we insisted did the host get another boat. Which we had to pay for. The day was yet another disappointment due to the lack of communication. We're thinking, we are paying this guy to be a rude jerk?? His 1st word of communication to us was wanting to know if we brought him lunch. 5. When it came time to settle the bill, the owner addresses none of these issues. And tried to charge us more than the agreed price for the cabin.If this sounds like whining I mean it not to be. If you have had a good experience at Goose Bay, great. However, we did not. The owner saw no responsibility in any of the issues. Ivy"
524515,Guest,2002-10-21 13:33:00,0,"By the sounds of both posts, you all have a right to be upset.It is unfortunate this happened to your group. Guess you'll be heading elsewhere in the future. A bad rap is hard to shake!!1 unsatisfied customer tells 10. Wish I was @ camp then cause I enjoy taking people out since the wife rarely fishes!"
524496,Boots,2002-09-30 19:44:00,19,"What were you not happy with at Goose Bay? A large group of us are planning our first trip to Lac Seul in July 2003. We have the lodges narrowed down to Goose Bay, Gold Pines, or Evergreen Lodge. We dont expect any of these places to be a Holiday Inn. In fact we would feel uncomfortable being at a fancy place. Just want good honest folks running the camp at a reasonable price. If you cant be more specific about your encounter at Goose Bay it will still be on our list of camps to consider."
524497,2 DOGS,2002-09-30 23:26:00,361,"Familiar with most all the lodges in that area and Evergreen has the newest cabins and equipment (boats & motors). IMHO I would rank the 6 camps in that general area in this order. 1. Evergreen 2. Golden Eagle 3. Gold Pines 4. Golden Fawn 5. Goose Bay 6. TimberlaneYou would have to check on rates for ""03"" but I think they are in the same ballpark. However, you usually get just what you pay for."
524498,Guest,2002-10-01 06:13:00,0,O.K. - Here is the deal. Our cabin was not ready when we were told it would be. The first two days we had scheduled to have a guide - there was none. The guide we ended up with on the third day was under the weather and not prepared. In addition the camp was a mess.We ended up doing a day fly in on the last day - now that was a first class operation.Keep releasing the big onesBigfish
524499,Guest,2002-10-01 19:49:00,0,"i have come to the conclusion that guides on lac seul are a pretty unreliable group. many, many, many posts here about guides not showing up for appointments. the only guide i ever used in canada (not lac seul) was a really bad drunk. he sobered up long enough to do a good job for us. these are obviously part time situations and do not offer steady employment even in season. i think that the lodge owners are at their mercy. even the ""best"" lodge on lac seul uses college students. may be that one should expect problems with these folks. as one poster on this board put it ""taking a guide on lac seul is like taking a 6 pack into a bar"". who needs em?"
524502,woman,2002-10-02 03:59:00,2,"I take offence to this last post. We pride ourselves in who we provide as guides on lac seul and although it is not necessary to have a guide (because of the quality of fishing) it is a plus to learn presentaion, structor, and technic, pamper you with shore lunch, etc. I don't know who the BEST resort on the lake is, but I do know our guides are not students and are booked a yesr in advance from repeat customers. The price is right for what you get."
524503,Guest,2002-10-02 06:25:00,0,"I don't doubt that there are great guides on Lac Suel. For being our first time on Lac suel it was necessary for us to hire a guide.It's a large and dangerous body of water in the fall with only a map. Our guide was ""under the weather"" and only spoke to us a few times. We basically followed him around, without him even telling us he was moving. I'm sure that by staying at a better lodge, the guide situation will improve.Thanks to all for the advice!Bigfish"
524504,Guest,2002-10-02 19:08:00,0,"So...Because the guide was less than desirable it is the resort owners fault? Granted the owner scheduled the guide but probally isn't an employee of said resort and most are hired out independantly. Did you pay this individual the full amount for his poor guide service? Before leaving the dock, did you discuss w/guide what your expectations were? Did you notify the owner that the guide service was not what you expected or the accomidation situation? Did they try to make it good? Guess if you don't speek up...can't rectify the problem??? Just wondering...."
524505,aaron,2002-10-02 21:20:00,6,"I do understand what they are saying,there is nothing worse than a unreliable guide.Oh yeah there is, people that expect because they spend hard earned money to come to canada that the world owes them something.Maybe next time try asking the camp owner about these things,dont think because you figure you have a case for yourself that it gives you the right to screw someones livelyhood.I would say that the camp owner probably has a few things to say to you,but he cant be caught up in the B.S.My advise is goto eagle lake and get the camp owner to get a guide for you.I just came back from fishing with 3 guides and your any guides worst nightmare,never pleased,dont want to pay the bill and couldnt catch a cold."
524500,Guest,2002-10-03 10:45:00,0,"Hey what about Scout Bay, Silver Water Wheel, and Ojibway. They rank at the top of anybody's list. This trashing crap is tiresome."
524501,Guest,2002-10-04 11:02:00,0,"Kim, I have heard terrific things about Silver Water wheel the past couple years, they are extremely well thought of. Don't know anything about Ojibway, and Scout Bay has a real good reputation too.If you get a chance, see if Lac Suel Lodge has anything available. Dan stays pretty well booked though I think. I have used one of their outpost camps 10 of the past 13 years and they run a first rate operation. The outposts are reached by boat not fly in and are very well taken care of. Lac Suel is just remarkable...one of our group had a 30.5 inch Walley this June. We had many several over 25"" It is a terrific Lake..........but real big."
524486,Guest,2002-09-27 12:29:00,0,We stayed at Goose Bay lodge recently on Lac Suel. Our stay was not a pleasant one. When you only have a limited amount of time per year to fish - spend it with a quality camp. I won't make the mistake again.Bigfish

524492,aaron,2002-09-27 17:20:00,6,"Im not bad mouthing anyone,but if they went to LacSeul and had a bad time it wasn't the lakes fault.I think theres more to the story,maybe a fly in would be beter because than the lodge owner wouldnt have to wory about getting his lodge trashed this way.aaron"
524493,Guest,2002-09-27 19:26:00,0,The problem was not with the lake is was with the owners lack of detail for their guests and a sloppy facilty. I don't want to see someone else in that situation.Keep throwin them back!Bigfish

This is not the place to try and grab guest.Welcome to Canada, come back, enjoy, and may your next experience on Lac seul be a memory of a life time."
524495,Guest,2002-09-30 14:02:00,0,Wondering if you could elaborate on the subject. Your comments are very vague. Guess if you are warning fellow fishin-people about the cons-it would be nice to know more.....Waitin for a bite.
