525159,Guest,2002-11-11 16:43:00,0,"what do you call a possum with no arms no legs and no torso? dick! hahaha! ok fine...heres a better one,a guy in ontario notices that alot of newfies are really really happy. so he asks his doctor why are newfies so happy? the doctor says ""its because they've been all gettin sergury to remove half there brain."" so the man says i want this surgery. the doctor says ""that'll make you really really stupid"" the man says, ""idont care."" ""if i'm happy all the time, who cares?"" so after the surgery, the doctor asks him how do you feel. the man sits up and says, ""i pledge alliegence to the flag of the United States of America.""haha, any better? fine one more and i'm out. this is for the americans though,a canadian guy wants to buy farm land in america. he's taking a tour of the farm when he spots a bee hive in a tree. he says the the american ""i dont think that bee hive looks to safe, i'mallergic to bees."" the american says ""i've never had a problem with it."" the candian shrugs and finishes off the tour. he brings up the bee hive business again so the american says, ""fine...i tell you what if you get stung when you are strapped to that tree naked i'll give you the farm for free."" the candian shrugs and agees. the next morining the american comes out and sees the canadian all pale and flushed. he runs over and says, ""i'm sorry! i'll call an ambulance...you can have the farm for free!"" the canadian replies, ""no, i wasnt stung. but does that baby cow have a mother?""ok i'm all out. talk to you guys later!"

525153,Waliwz,2002-11-07 17:20:00,23,hey allhang that possum on the wall and call it Art! or throw it in a pile of leaves and call it Russle....or dont call it any thing...cause it wont come any way!
525132,Guest,2002-11-07 17:30:00,0,Now a post like that is just rude!That is why some Canadians think Americans are rude and obnoxious. But that is not true...I know lots of Americans that are very nice ..friendly and maybe a bit more outgoing then your average Canadian...But your remarks are the reason some of your country men are painted as rude!It just goes to show ...there are jerks in every country ..no one country has the market cornered!
525146,Guest,2002-11-07 17:33:00,0,hey ..not pea in soup ...but pea soup!! or pee soup

525133,Rick,2002-11-07 21:12:00,226,"And exactly how would you categorize Trent's comments in reply #28? Is this typical Canadian? Should we judge all Canadians by him?No,I don't really think that Canadians are any better or worse than Americans, but I couldn't see an insult like that go unanswered.I have to apologize to any Canadian I offended, other than Trent Old Boy. He seems to be as obnoxious and rude as any American I know."
525134,Guest,2002-11-08 05:29:00,0,Hey RickU do have a point # 28 is also rude!cant we all just go fishing!I know I dont have to travel all the way to the U.S.A. to find rude people....but for the most part people that I meet while fishing are good down to earth people ..who know how to respect and enjoy nature!maybe it is not nationality that is the deciding factor in this ...some people are just rude...the rest of us just fish!
525155,Guest,2002-11-09 10:23:00,0,I would rather fish with any American than any whiner from eastern Canada and I say that out of experiance.
525156,Guest,2002-11-10 06:28:00,0,"Thats because fags like you from Alberta don't know how to fish.Talk about whiners , where do you think the Canadian Alliance is located?Nuff Said.."

525147,Guest,2002-11-05 20:29:00,0,"Lets not blame only Americans when it comes to this. I was fishing on LOW with my brother and his wife who had come from Calgary to try LOW for the first time. We were anchored over a school of nice walleyes when a boat came out of nowhere and started trolling circles around us I'm talking within 6'. He had to have spotted us with binoculars and liked what he saw. I told my brother not to be intimated by this and to just keep fishing. While we did and we kept hauling them in while the other boat only caught one 8"". He didn't have the sense to realize that the fish didn't want a moving bait. Any ways he swore about how bad the fishing was and left after about 15min. but not without blasting his 200hp full throttle as he left. This guys boat had a local number on it so ignorance knows no borders. Anyways, you Americans are always welcome by me and if Lac Seul doesn't want you, come to LOW."

525149,Guest,2002-11-06 13:03:00,0,"I live close to Lac Seul and have seen it all. The best thing to happen was the ban on camping by non-residents within 1/2 mile of Lac Seul.Sure did suck when every good spot was loaded with people and the shoreline littered with junk!Head to LOW , I couldn't care less about tourist around Lac Seul.Doesn't mean I don't know lots of US people and enjoy fishing with them from time to time, but if you don't have some common respect for others around you then stay home.That goes for the US Rambo's too that only care about themselves when hunting north of the Lookout........!"
525150,Guest,2002-11-07 10:07:00,0,"i think L.O.W is the most overated,dirty and abused lake in all of nwo.If you are from the area you cant tell me with a straight face that the 8000 camps on lake havent made it like a garbage dumpster.I would drink Lac Seul water!Would you drink LoW water?You can tell how dirty Kenora is a reflection of how the lake is.I would say that 3/4s of the septic systems are not even legal,where is the waste going?I guess you are welcoming people there. Someone that knows!"
525151,Guest,2002-11-07 16:30:00,0,hahaha! thats a great idea send the mosquitos down south...i guess it wouldnt hurt to mix some of our black flies and horse flies with the hord either. and i did not no that what they called armodilos in texas...but its funny! i guess you should no what canadas national bird is? you guessed it the mosquito
525152,Guest,2002-11-07 16:33:00,0,"oops, i forgot my joke...what do you call a possum with no arms, no legs floating in the water? bob! haha! i got one more...what do you call a female possum with no arms no legs leaning on a wall? Ilean!"

525138,Guest,2002-10-31 16:12:00,0,"just to break the ice on something, also this summer i met a few guys from indiana. they were kind responsible people, they were gonna target smallies but came too soon, so instead they went for bluegill. the funny thing was that he said to me ""i couldnt belive it, we got here and i said to myself 'holy ****e the place is all populated!'"" it was hilarious, cause right after he asked me if there were any bears around in the area. i no this is canada but its not like were all forest and stuff. just a funny story i thought everyone would enjoy."
525139,Guest,2002-11-01 06:58:00,0,"Sure, and next you'll be telling us that you have cars and TVs and such. We all know that you guys live in log cabins, travel by dog sleds, and access the internet with squirrel powered treadmills in your generators. And in case you think about sending your bears down here, our possums get big enough to kick their butts!"
525140,Guest,2002-11-02 12:48:00,0,"hahahaha, its good to have some humour on this discussion. but with all seriousnous our beavers can take you possums any day."
525141,Guest,2002-11-03 06:51:00,0,Good point. I've seen some of your beavers.You know why the chicken crossed the road? To show the possums how to do it without getting flattened.
525115,Guest,2002-10-26 07:06:00,0,Hey Wacker- you going to have your wife up there next year? Maybe is she good lookin???
525122,Guest,2002-10-26 14:06:00,0,"holy crap!! does this post ever remind me of this summer at my cottage! i do catch and release from my dock and have been doing it for quite some time. so i have a tonne of small fish and big ones too. this boat rental place had a client fish right infront of my dock. he caught a boat load of panfish and kept every single one of'em. i was thinking thats ok. next thing i no i got 9 boats circled around my dock!!! they were sending them over to my dock! they kept everything! they literally fished my shreo line out! i hate to say it but they were all americans. they were so close when my mom went swimming she was right beside there lines! we had people watching us in our cottages for 5 weeks straight! then finally one day they didnt catch anything, so you know what they did? moved onto another place and fished it out! how can anyone possible eat like 10 poounds of panfish a day! i really wanted to throw bricks into there boats!!how is this helping canadian fisheries at all! if they come back next year i'm going water skiing till they leave!"
525116,Walleye Wacker,2002-10-26 15:38:00,6,Depends how you like your women....she always looks good when she is dipping my 10 lb Walleyes.
525123,Guest,2002-10-28 05:45:00,0,"I think I would be having a ""friendly"" talk with the boat rental place , and not all the boats that they are sending there. Your frustrations seem a bit misdirected as it sounds like they are being told where to go fish when they rent the boat. I'm guessing that the owner has ""heard"" locally that you are doing quite well in front of your dock and figures he will get return/referral business if he puts folks on fish irrregardless of the fact that he is inconviencing you and your family."
525114,duffy,2002-10-28 07:20:00,49,"I thought road rage was bad, we now have fishing rage. Lighten up and enjoy."
525124,Guest,2002-10-28 12:08:00,0,"wonder if you would have raised ##### had that been one of your brilliant canadian brothers???in europe there is a deal where you stay away from the other fishermen as far as a RUN would be...meaning stay 150 yards away if i am fishing for ? carp.maybe you can't tell what i'm fishing for ,stay away till you find out...."
525125,Guest,2002-10-28 14:55:00,0,"its not that the guy knows i'm catchin huge fish or anything. they're catching 6 inch bluegill. pretty much anywhere you go on Rice there is blue gill. i no you could go 20 yards off the boat rental dock and catch bluegill and other panfish. they are deliberately sending boats over, they come in fleets. nothing i say will stop them...they dont understand that there are other palces (pretty much everywhere) you can catch hundreds of panfish. for some reason they in front of my dock is a honey hole. i dont care if they're american or not. ##### i've seen canadians doing the same thing and it pisses me off, i dont group people together. either way they are trying to fish the place out. it should be selective harvest not catch and keep everything possible then leave. it takes time for fisheries to get high in numbers. this just pisses me off in every way. i could care less if the caught and kept 5-7 fish then left then came back a couple days later. thats fine but the fact that they sit there and keep everything and tell all the people that rent boats ""hey go fishing in front of the cottage with the red boat..."" thats just wrong!!!!!!"
525126,Guest,2002-10-28 15:23:00,0,"Rapala 14....Paint your boat another color or put a sign on your dock that says....""Fish On This Side Of Lake Are Wormy"" Or stand on your dock and start shooting trap when the boats get close."
525127,Guest,2002-10-28 16:51:00,0,"I know of what you speak Rapala14....I think this is why...Generally, Canadians don't target panfish.....Americans do....after all they taste so darn good.Generally, Canadians don't keep every Panfish they catch....Americans do....after all it's not like they're raping their favorite lake back home.Generally, Canadians are too polite to infringe on someone else's fishing space....Americans don't care....after all they're on vacation!!Generally speaking, this does not to apply to everybody....just the majority....after all society teaches us ""every man for himself"".Just some observations....please don't be offended my American brothers if what I type is true."
525128,Guest,2002-10-28 18:05:00,0,"I guess thats why the fish in the U.S.A ,because even a school of wormy panfish gets every boat in the lake there now!Last year a group of boats swarmed me for an afternoon,they didn't even know that there was a no stringer law on the lake.They took off after they seen us catch 20 fish to there 1 under slot,that they put on a stringer.I like to say that they were nice guys,that got overwhelmed with good fishing that they cant help themselves.Its nice to be a local!"
525109,Guest,2002-10-23 21:34:00,0,"Hey Blue, is that a promise?? Get lost and never come back...boy. And you know where you can stick your George Washingtons!! As if your measley few bucks has any impact on our booming economy whatsoever. Your arrogance is so typical. Compare them my friend, and you shall see, that it is not Canada who are spinning their wheels in the mud...boy. Remember, stick to your words and never come to Canada again. And now I'd say it's time to go out and get yourself a new catfish rig...boy."
525110,Guest,2002-10-24 04:04:00,0,"It's a shame to see people talking bad about both our countries when it's the individual causing the problems, I have been in the U.S Military for almost 13 years and have served next to Canadian Soldiers in Haiti and Afganastan and have nothing but the highest respect for them, And I am one of those Americans that goes up North to fish when ever he gets the chance, And I have always been treated with the greatest respect from any canadian, And I will always give that respect back in return, As a American I would give my life for Canada as would many other Canadian soldiers do for America in return . As we have seen thru out the war on Terror many Canadian and American soldiers have fought and died together . Thank you for your support (one team one fight) Sgt Flip"
525111,Walleye Wacker,2002-10-24 06:21:00,6,"We were on Lac Seul after a 1000 mile trip form the states and fishing on a ""Hot Spot"". There was not a boat in sight for several hours and than suddenly a cabin cruiser pulled up to within ten feet of us and started fishing . They announced they were from Dryden, EH. They were casting all around us and being very annoying ,but we shared our pop and sandwichs with them and even gave them a few Leechs. At one point one of them got in our boat and asked me if I could tie on his jig. I of course did and even gave him a handfull of extra jigs. I guess this proves that us USA boys believe in being friendly and shareing with our good friends from Canada. After all there are plenty of fish for everybody and being friendly is better than being a Pirate. We even send those Dryden boys birthday cards every year and a big smoked Ham for xmas."
525112,Guest,2002-10-24 07:17:00,0,I agree with every one. What is the need to get so close to someone else when its a huge lake?I would think the proper and respectfull thing to do is leave everyone some room to enjoy themselves.Good thing he wasn't hunting and had this happen!It's a big lake.
525113,Guest,2002-10-24 09:42:00,0,"People can be so ignorant sometimes!! When I'm fishing and a guy pulls up beside me and asks if I've had any luck I give him my standard answer......no. When I've told the truth, I've had the bozo drop his anchor 2 feet off my bow and he starts fishing my spot. That is why I don't share anymore. Zero etiquette, low class parasites are the worst. Find your own fish and leave me alone.Even worse is when I have one on and some loser pulls up right beside me and starts asking me things like, what you got there?...and, what are you using?...and, what technique are you using?...and, what kind of fish is that?....All I can say to jerks like that is, get lost a$$hole."
525117,Waliwz,2002-10-24 10:20:00,23,Hey JoeThanks for your post...the sound of reason....echoes off the the barren landscape of ignorance!It is not about spelling or money or nationality...it is about humanity and friendship and honor.neither country has a monopoly on ignorance or hospitality.I would hate to be held accountable to the lowest Canadian...just because he is Canadian!courtesy and manners go a long way towards being a welcome guest ...it also applies to being a good host!Good fishing and hunting. pass it on ...take a youngster
525118,Lundman 1700,2002-10-25 00:02:00,65,"I hear what you're saying. Be courteious to others and give them some room. But on the other hand, speaking as the Devil's advocate, what makes you think you own that part of the lake, just because you were there first? You speak as if you own those fish when you say let him find his own fish. Maybe I'm just used to fishing in heavy traffic, but I've met some very nice people while fishing in close proximity to other boats. As long as everyone pays attention to what they're doing there aren't any problems. There will always be some boneheads, you will never be free of them. Besides ,it makes me feel good when I'm slamming walleyes and people want to know what Im doing and they're not."
525119,duffy,2002-10-25 05:38:00,49,"For as long as I have been posting on this board i have always asked the same question. Why would anyone want to go through the hassels of going to Canada to compete for fishing spots? We can do that here. I go to Canada to fish untouched wilderness lakes where I never see another boat except for the guys I am with. To me, it's what makes Canada special in my heart. A beautiful, tranqual, untouched wilderness fishing experieince. I can't wait for next spring!!! Just me two cents.duffy"
525120,eyewitness,2002-10-25 08:37:00,680,"Hi Sean, I agree. Unfortunately when fishing drive to's like Lac Seul you are going to run into other folks quite a bit. A lot of times they are on ""your"" spot too. The thing that kills me most though is that even with half a brain and no electronics, a guy can go catch plenty of walleyes without fishing next to, or on top of someone. Lac Seul has an infinite number of spot on the spots. You couldn't possibly know them all in a lifetime. I think if inexperienced fisher folk approached the situation honestly and respectfully it would make a huge difference in their outcome. For instance, if a boat pulled up and said to me ""hey, we don't have a clue what we're doing, and we don't intend to fish by you, but could you give us some tips and point us in the right direction?"" I'd be more than happy to share some insight. It's amazing how many camp owners don't help their customers out with the hows and whys of where they send them to fish. Of course guided trips are different, but half the fun is learning ""why"" you caught fish where you did and then finding similar spots to fish. It's too bad so many ""visiters"" don't get that perspective from their experiences."

525101,Boots,2002-10-23 16:34:00,19,I will be going to Lac Seul for the first time next year with about 10 others. I will tell them to look for the boat with the pirate flag and if any of us spot your flag to radio the rest of us. If you are there it has to be a good spot. We wont need a guide. We will watch for you Bill. See you in late July

525104,River_eye,2002-10-23 17:03:00,1486,"I agree with you about the space thing, it's rediculous to think that we drive out to the other side of the lake just to have some jerk who can't find fish pull up beside you.Thing is though, I have this problem most on Crowduck lake, and it's mostly Canadians that do it there. There are Jacka$$'s on either side of the border."
525105,Guest,2002-10-23 18:33:00,0,Another good reason for Americans to not bother fishing Canada. Let's keep our ugly money on our side of the border. Do some traveling in the states where the people appreciate the tourism dollars.
