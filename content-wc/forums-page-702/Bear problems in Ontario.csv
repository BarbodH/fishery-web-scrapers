557638,Crappie Kid,2006-05-24 15:19:00,1581,My friend had to put down a menacing bear at some outpost in Ontario last year. The owner gave them a gun to have at the outpost cabin because of previous complaints about this bear. How likely is it to encounter such a creature and has one ever ruined your trip?
557642,Guest,2006-05-24 16:10:00,0,I spend more time then on average camping in the area . In my 38 years I never had one problem that couldn't be handled easly. We have had them break into the cottage while we were down. That poor bear had to be destroyed simply because people don't take care of there garbage or fish remains. But he could smell food through the screen window we left open. I'm sure the Ontario consevatoin office has a booklet that will have information on what to do if a situation should happen
557645,MoWalleyeguy,2006-05-24 16:44:00,409,"Thats it exactly... People are not smart sometimes about how they store there food or trash. Once they get a taste they will be back and will get very bold. We dont see bears every year but we do see them more then not. So far never a problem, but we sure watch out for them. Most black bears are small compared to other types, but still big enough to put a man down pretty easy I think."
557646,Guest,2006-05-24 18:09:00,0,"Bear proof your area. No food or garbage in easy access. I've spent a lot of time in the bush and have only had to destroy one bear and that was preventable had ""others"" looked after their area. We clean our fish up the lake and take extreme care with the garbage. OMNR takes a dim view of guns in the bush in the summer . Good luck...."

We had to look out windows to make sure there were no bears around before we left the cabin.The owners said they were ""dump bears"".The older bears would get kicked out of the dump by younger bears.The older bears would look for garbage in camp, houses etc.The C.O. would put a trailer baited with food and wait, the bear would walk in, the gate would come down traping the bear, then the C.O. would hook up the trailer and relocate the bear.The bears would get three chances to get trapped,after that the bears would would be shot on sight, they say the bears are to smart for their own good.It was great eating breakfast while watching bears sniff around the cabin.I guess that is one of the reasons I love going to Canada every year.You don't see that kind of wildlife in Chicago.Except the freaking rabbits, we are over run with them."

557675,Guest,2006-05-25 09:48:00,0,We had a Bear sitting on our porch the first day we were at a Outpost several years ago. He stayed in Camp all week and tore one of the boats up the last day. Every time we went outside he would be there and stay within 30 feet of you. We could run him off but he would be back in a few minutes. He had to be put down by the camp owner next week because he would't leave. I'm sure that the group or one of the groups before us had been careless with their garbage and it ended up costing the Bear. To me this is a big a waste of natures gifts as it is to clean slot fish.
557687,Guest,2006-05-25 12:59:00,0,"We had a bear get into our cabin last year - three times. The first time we were not there, we came back to the cabin and the front screened-in porch had a rather large hole in it and the front door was open. The second time, was about midnight and we were home. We heard noise on the porch and looked out the window to see a bear on the porch. We yelled, stomped our feet, and pounded on the door and it ran off. The third time was about an hour later. Our cabin had the refrigerator on the front porch and Yogi (our nickname for him) had figured out how to open it. We tried the yelling, stomping and pounding but he must have been hungry because he didn't leave until the refrigerator was empty. Good thing we only had one more night in camp. The next morning we told the camp owner our story. He was afraid that a bear that was that hard to scare away might be a real problem so he notified the DNR people. The next night he cooked bacon on an open fire and waited for Yogi to return. About sun-up we heard the gun go off. I think the seal on the refrigerator door may have been bad and Yogi simply smelled supper - too bad for him. I wouldn't say this ruined our trip, in fact, we have had a lot of fun telling the story over the past year and we are counting the days, 22 to be exact, until we are back in the same cabin."

I never felt threatened by these bears , and are easly scared off short term. For those very bears I have a old 30/30 at the lake for when you never know . Bears seem to be far more dangerous up here just before they den when food is scarce and they are trying to fatten up. I have foud that most problem bears are runts and get there #### kicked out of everywhere they go. We generally have large bears walk through our yard without a care in the world. Their just passing by. It's when they are on your deck looking in when you have a #### disturber. A sling shot to the #### with a bearing has always sent them running ."
557694,Schief79,2006-05-25 15:59:00,11,We were at a fly-in camp last year and the first night a bear broke into the screened fish cleaning house. Guys heard him during the night and kind of enjoyed the excitement. The screen was torn and muddy paw prints on the door. We are careful to tend to our garbage and cleaned the fish house good. We take the fish carcases by boat away from camp and put them on the big rocks for the Gulls. We told the caretaker and he came and sat on the dock the next afternoon with his rifle for a hour and we knew that was a waste of his time. Never did see any bear after that first night. Go Navy
