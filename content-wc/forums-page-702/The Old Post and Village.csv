556158,Billfish,2006-04-11 22:25:00,8,Has anyone been there recently? How good is the walleye and pike fishing? Planning a trip in mid-June and we are looking for some advice. Anything would be great! Good Fishing!
556162,Guest,2006-04-12 01:00:00,0,"Pike fishing is good to great depending on the weather when you go. Walleye volume is good, but not much size compared to some other similar fisheries in the region. The Old Post sails a decent ship . . . I've heard of numerous issues with the owner, but nothing too serious. NWO Fishing Bum"
556167,Guest,2006-04-12 11:06:00,0,"Thanks, Fishing Bum. Are you from NW Ohio? I am from the Toledo Area. What if any issues are you willing to talk about? I truly appreciate any info! Good Fishing"

While we're now reasonably familiar with the lake, have safe routes and lots of good spots in the gps's, and so on, we very much enjoy our guided experience, and the cost is nominal when spread across our group. Great camp. John"

Can you email additional details or words of advice? I have my own 20' Lund Alaskan that I will bring along together with hiring a guided boat too. Do you have any marked-up lake maps that I could pay you to copy and mail to me? I am concerned about bow-busting table rocks. We are 100% catch and release. My email is [email protected]. Thanks, DAVID[email protected]"
557600,pfg1,2006-05-24 00:42:00,52,"Hello John, I hope you are well. I accidentally erased your last email with the waypoints and trail logs of Lake St. Joseph. Any chance you can resend it to me at [email protected] ?? Thanks, DAVID"
557603,Guest,2006-05-24 07:19:00,0,"Hi Dave. I'll try to send them again. A warning - from the plot trails, the reader can't tell if I was zooming across safe water, or inching along at 2 mph, threading my way through navigational hazards. However, when used with caution together with the sonar, lake map (which has general depth contours by shaded color) and common sense, hopefully they'll be of some help. Best of luck for a safe trip. John"
557693,Guest,2006-05-25 15:51:00,0,Have been going to Old post since in opened in the late 80's. A fine camp and well run with excellent guides and a cusine that is exceptional. The owner John is an excellent camp owner and tries his hardest to satisfy your every need. The bad news is that you really need to be every vigilant. Rock shoels and rocks all over the place if you don't know where you are going. A good GPS and a day or so of guidance will give you a trip that is hard to beat.
