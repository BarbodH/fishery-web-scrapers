Canada requires proof that you are insured while in Canada. Some insurance companies do not cover you while in any foreign country, so that little card is not acceptable. A letter from your car insurance agent is acceptable. I've never been asked for this at the border, but if I ever have an accident while there, I'm sure I'll need it. I always call my agent before going to Canada and he issues me a letter stating that my coverage is good in that country. He does not charge me for doing this."

They even increased my Liability, Bodily Injury and Property Damage coverage just in case my policy didn't meet the minimum financial responsibility for the provinces and territories of Canada. This was done at no extra cost. I guess I am in good hands! Joe"
