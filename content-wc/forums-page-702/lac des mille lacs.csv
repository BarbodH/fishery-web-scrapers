557751,Guest,2006-05-26 20:43:00,0,"eyehunter, where do you stay and what part of the lake do you fish? I've been going up there for about 17-18 years now. Usually stay at pine point. We pull crankbaits across from pinepoint and down by the narrows. Usually take a trip to boulton bay too. We are going up July 22"

But they said the fishing was good. I'm headed up 24 June. Hope you do well. If you get a chance let us know how things go."

557848,Guest,2006-05-30 10:13:00,0,"haven't fished lac des miles lacs in a few years. stayed at maki bay resort as well as pine point resort. maki bay (the small bay by the resort) has always been very productive and has a real good evening bite.there are 2 small bays just outside of bolton bay that are usually pretty good as well. any island or point with some wind blowing across it should produce. good luck and would like to see how you did. i know that they instituted a slot or other size restriction that should help this beautiful fishery. will be at snake bay lotw next week and will give a full report, and look forward to yours as well. we usually trolled floating rapalas for most of our fishing at this time of year.gold and silver with black backs are the colors we used. good luck and good fishing. weather looks pretty good for next week.96 hours til we hit the dock!!! bender out"
