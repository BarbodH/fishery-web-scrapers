557763,ksboy2,2006-05-27 07:55:00,38,i am heading to northern ontario in july with showalters outposts. we will be fishing apps lake. here is my question: what are the best colors/sizes/styles of soft plastics to take for these walleye? kirk miller kansas
557767,Guest,2006-05-27 09:28:00,0,The best type of plastic is none at all. Seriously. Tip your bare jig with a minnow. It works best in Shield country.
557773,kbkakes,2006-05-27 12:32:00,49,"Power baits, Yum, or Gulp in shad or twister style baits. Preferably scented 3 or 4 inch. Also Salted minnows. I use either or or both at the same time.. Live bait works best but you do not need it. You could use the money saved to tip your pilot. Good fishin Kevin"
557780,Mr. Walleye,2006-05-27 17:43:00,74,"I really like 4"" bright colored twister tails on a bright colored 1/4 oz. jig head. 3"" are fine, but it seems the bigger walleye like the bigger twisters where we go. We either backtroll or drift most of the time, and get just as many, if not more on the plastics. We don't bother with minnows but do take in some crawlers and a few leeches in cast the weather gets funky. I normally use a twister or a half a crawler on a jig. I don't like to have both on at the same time. Good luck!"
557781,Guest,2006-05-27 19:00:00,0,"Gulp 3"" Black Leeches work great, and the smallies or perch won't rob em'. Rig em' just like a twister tail, don't bother putting it thru the sucker on the Glup Leech. You'll get better action and hook-ups that way. Chuck"
557782,Guest,2006-05-27 19:10:00,0,"We also fly-out with Showalter's (Sand Point). We have had the best luck with leeches. Last year we took crawlers and had some luck, but not noticeably better than the leeches. The problem we had with the crawlers is that we had to buy so many (Cabela's) and then tranport them. BTW...there no better experience than flying out with Ed or Eddie. Good Luck. We will be at South Rapids the 3rd week in June."
