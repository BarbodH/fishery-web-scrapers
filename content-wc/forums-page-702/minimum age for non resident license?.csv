557690,Trailerguy,2006-05-25 14:55:00,1407,[font color=green size=3][b] Non-residents 18 years of age and older must purchase a licence. Non-residents under 18 years of age may fish without a licence if accomanied by an adult who has a valid Ontario fishing licence. Any fish caught are part of the adults catch and possesion limit. Non-residents under 18 yrs. may purchase a licence and any fish they catch applies to the limits of that licence. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby

557702,Guest,2006-05-25 19:35:00,0,What if you are nonresident with your 16 year old and also a 10 year old? Is my license enough? We are C+R only so limits don't matter. eric
