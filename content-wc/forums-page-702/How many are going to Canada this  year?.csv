557770,Tonyo,2006-05-27 10:20:00,212,"Gullrock lake - 5 Lakes Lodge June 3-10th 9 guys 7 days to go. As for the gas issue, why would anyone give up a trip to the great white north for an extra $100."
557833,MRLUNKER,2006-05-29 18:47:00,8,My Grandson is making his first trip to Canada this summer with my Wife and I. I am really looking forward to this trip! We go to Berthelot Lake Lodge in Quebec and fly in to an outpost lake. Fishing is great! I realize the trip will cost more this year but the memories with him and my wife will be priceless.
557843,Guest,2006-05-30 08:44:00,0,"Gas is of concern to us as well. We have 8 going up to Ignace on June 10th, and we are from St. Louis. Looks like we'll have to pinch our pennies just to fill our tanks. Neal"
556923,waleht,2006-05-05 18:32:00,132,"Well I hope you don't take a trip anywhere then. I asssume tha gas prices will be the same where ever you go. Also my resort owner is from the US and always has only accepted U.S. Funds so the value of the dollar don't mean much for me. Oh I forgot about breakfast on the way up.....um I don't think it will break me. Waleht ""A man has to know his limitations!""."

These trips are for building memories, lifelong friendships, and taking time to relax. That was hit home last week. We will toast to our friend with a tall Wiser's and thank the fishing god's for allowing us to be a small part."

556467,LeeHawk,2006-04-24 20:12:00,12,"Dear Friends, I am 60, 61 in September. Will retire Dec. 31, 2006. I have type 2 diabetes, had a malignant skin cancer spot removed from my face this spring, and have spent quite a few years in a high pressure professional position. I am going to Canada for three weeks this summer (Wabaskang, Long-Legged Lake, and one undecided). Last summer I was there for three weeks. I have rented a log cabin in northern Arkansas for the entire month of April of 2007. I will fish the White River, Bull Shoals, and/or Norfork Lake. I have my own fishing boat. I have season tickets for Iowa Hawkeye football and basketball. I will follow Iowa to a football bowl game for the 4th year in a row. I will be pheasant hunting with my Brittany, Daisy, in South Dakota and Iowa this fall/winter. I will spend time with grandkids (7) and likely travel to the mountains again soon. My advice: Don't let $3.00 per gallon gasoline or other minor issues deter you. And remember... Nobody ever, on his/her death bed, said, ""I sure wish I had worked longer and more hours."" Sincerely, Dr. Lee"
