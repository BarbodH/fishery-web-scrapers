557820,Guest,2006-05-29 11:12:00,0,A conservation license allows you to keep two fish daily(per species) and bring home two each. A regular 8 day is 4 fish per person. some camps will pay for your conservation.
557830,EyeBanger,2006-05-29 17:23:00,23,"Isn't the cost of the 8 day licenses up about $3 from the past few years? I realize that you are now getting an extra day, but since most camps are on a 7-day cycle, most people won't get the benefit of the 8th day."
