Roll walleye in sesame seeds and fry until just done. Use oil sparingly or even dry fry as the sesame seeds have lots of oil in them. Serve with Wasabi if you like it.

Would anyone be willing to share some of their favorite ways to cook walleye and pike. Thanks in advance!"

Fry to a golden brown in just enough olive oil to puddle on the bottom of the pan. You'll think this is ""uptown"" restaurant stuff...... Bon Apetite' Lunk"

557686,Guest,2006-05-25 12:38:00,0,"Hmmm... I could never tire from a fresh walleye bake (or beers for that matter). Anyhow, here's my crowd favorite, a milk and egg batter, and if you have any fast food connections, battered in KFC original recipe flour and fried in a combination of margerine and vegetable oil! can't tell you the secret ingredience, but if you can get a hold of a little flour from your local KFC, then you're laughing."

Garlic can be added as well, but too much will drown out all the other flavors. Fresh spices work a little better, but can be inconvenient. Dried/powdered is okay too. If they are big enough, and you have a grill with a grate small enough, grill them after sprinkling with lemon pepper. Be sure to get them off as soon as they're done so they don't fall in the fire. Can leave the skin on to help hold them together or use aluminum foil over the grill Bring a light broth soup starter mix and a little before the stuff is cooked, add chunks of fish. Simmer until the fish is cooked. Great with some wild rice added, but the rice takes a while to cook. But my favorite by far is the plain old fried in beer batter."

Cover with aluminum foil and bake 20-25 minutes on the grill depending on the thickness of the fillets. This can be done for shore lunch, back at the cabin or at home. This is one of my favorite, quick recepies."

557756,FISHNBOWLJOE,2006-05-27 00:14:00,80,"Try using a Japanes style bread crumb called Panko. It might be a little hard to find. Use it as you normally would or use the directions on the back of the bag. My friend told me to try it using a miture of egg/milk/salt/pepper (plus any added spices or seasoning you prefer) dip in mixture, then roll in panko and fry in skillet with BUTTER. Not oil or shotening, gotta be butter. Gonna try this one myself up in Canada in 2 weeks. Good Fishing! Joe"
