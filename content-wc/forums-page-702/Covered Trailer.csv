557712,bevy8,2006-05-25 22:56:00,8,Group of us are heading up north this summer and wanting to know if anyone has crossed the border with a Feather Lite trailer or any covered trailer and how that went crossing the border? Is there anything that I need to know before I take one up with the group this summer?? Thanks.....

Only got searched once, but it was a pretty thorough search, so wasted a lot of time and kind of a hassle carefully repacking everything. Anytime you pull a trailer long distances whether it's it's a boat or a cargo trailer it's just that many more things to hassle with, but I wouldn't say the border crossing would be a major concern."

Its not like the interstates of the USA where that is not as important. Here you will be on primarily two lane highways with vehicles attempting to pass . etc etc. Just a thought tommy"

It makes it easier to pack other items into the boat that creates extra dry storage in case of rain on the trip. 2. It makes it harder for somewone just strolling by to ""borrow"" your electronics, rods/reels, tackle boxes, because they can't ""window shop"" and know what they want to take from your rig just by looking in. 3. I made a trip to the river, about and hour drive, and when I got there, I found a cigarette butt (I don't smoke) that someone had thrown out the window stuck in one of my boats seats and had melteda a hole in the seat and back rest. The cover helps keep my carpet and seats intact."
