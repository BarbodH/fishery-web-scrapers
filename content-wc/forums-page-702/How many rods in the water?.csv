557002,Guest,2006-05-08 18:07:00,0,"I had no idea, no one ever said anything. I have fished the northern Ottowa River for the last 5 years and prior to that a few camps north of North Bay and also for years north of Lac St Jean in Quebec. And honestly no one ever said anything. I gotta start being smarter it seems. I guess no one here in Jersey says anything about two rods so we just kept up the tradition. This lawbreaker thanks you for your input."
557125,Guest,2006-05-11 11:28:00,0,"So what's the verdict? One or two rods? I have asked around a lot and hear both answers. On Lac Suel, is it 1 or 2? Any links to the correct answer?"
557126,Jimmy Jig,2006-05-11 11:43:00,1905,Its one!
557127,Guest,2006-05-11 11:43:00,0,"Read the rules. Get a fishing regulations brochure (they give them eith licenses, usually) and read the rules."
557745,Guest,2006-05-26 18:36:00,0,why would you want MORE than one is what gets me here.
557765,north_alabama,2006-05-27 08:59:00,172,"The regs I got off the internet for Ontario last year specify one line per person. I question regarding 3-way rigs (e.g., using a 3-way swivel with a diving crankbait on a leader coming off one eye and a spinner or spoon off a leader from the other). I wasn't sure if the multiple leaders constituted additional ""lines"". I called the MNR who forwarded me to an officer from the Thunder Bay District (the district I was headed to) who clarified the regs. In essense, you can have one line coming out of the water (implies one rod/reel for the way most people fish). It's okay to split the line under water as long as it is retrieved as one line, but you must comply with the hook limit regulation (it was 4 hooks last year, I haven't checked for changes in 2006 yet). If you tie treble hooks to your line beware they count as three hooks, not one. I was fishing ""inland"" and don't know one way or the other about special regulations on the Great Lakes. you can probably just google ""ontario fishing regualtions"", they are available for free download in PDF format."
556940,Guest,2006-05-06 19:41:00,0,I have been going north of the boarder for 12 years now and have never been told how many rods we can have in the water at one time. A guy I just met told me that he read in Canada you can only have one rod per person in the water. Is this new. I have always had a few rods per person in the water as we trolled. just curious to know if Me and the gang I fish with are lawbreakers
556941,Guest,2006-05-06 20:40:00,0,"In Ontario you would be breaking the law, one per person"
556942,skeeter 1880,2006-05-06 20:45:00,157,One only in Saskatchewan.
556949,grt1,2006-05-07 08:50:00,259,"rules have changed and the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources have changed the regulations to allow 2 rods per person when fishing on the Great Lakes, (Ontario, Erie, Huron, Superior)this was to be consistent with US regulations, other than that the law is 1 rod per person."
556950,Flip Silverlake,2006-05-07 16:37:00,645,It's been one rod per person as far back as I can remember. Who ever fishes or hunts up there needs to get a copy of the regs and read them before going out. A mistake like that could cost a lot of money. I've fished in Ont. since 1961.
556953,manitobawalleye,2006-05-08 05:27:00,885,"manitoba is also 1 per person manitoba .... a 100,000 lakes how many walleyes ???? i will never have enough time...."
556954,jigman 2003,2006-05-08 07:01:00,981,I can tell you that it has been one per person for at least 15 years. Probably longer. If you don't get a copy of the regs with your license you should ask for one. Nothing like being informed.
556956,lacywbosu,2006-05-08 07:43:00,171,Quebec it has been one rod since I have been going dating back to 1972.
556961,Guest,2006-05-08 11:08:00,0,Better do the right thing and turn yourself in.
556963,Guest,2006-05-08 11:48:00,0,One rod per person except in the Greayt Lakes OR ice fishing. NWO Fishing Bum
