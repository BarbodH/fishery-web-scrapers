Sunny but a little cool. Fishing was very good. I started in the swallows and went deeper. The walleyes seem to be sitting at 16-18ft deep. Caught some nice size also, one 26 inch, 24, 23 and a few 19-21 and alot of smaller fish... I tried a few new places and some old spots. I think most people did well out there. Looks like the fish are a little deeper this year at this point. We had people swimming at the docks today...Water Temp is much warmer. Tomorrows forecast is hot hot hot. 22C, 70F... See ya out there. Mista W"

557557,millerltman,2006-05-23 11:49:00,12,Can't wait to get up there...24 days to go! Sounds like the weather has been warmer up there than it is down here in Indiana.
557562,Guest,2006-05-23 12:49:00,0,"Well, those quality fish should still be waiting for you when you get here. I released all the ones over 20 inches. Actually my daughter caught the biggest one... Misty Walleye is a chip off the old block..hehehe We are getting ready for the Angler Young Angler Tournament next weekend.... Still looking for that 28 incher... Mista W"
557655,grt1,2006-05-24 21:13:00,259,I thought the limit was 18 inches not 20
557701,Guest,2006-05-25 19:24:00,0,"Easy there GRT. He said he was fishin' Red Lake. If he and his daughter are liscense holders they are able to keep 1 walleye each over 18"" as part of their possesion limit of 4. This doesn't make it right however it is not illegal. These are the same limits enforced down by you on Gullrock. Region 19? The only difference being the Gullrock Resort Owners Association policy that states only fish under 18"" will be cleaned in camp while staying at any of their facilities. You are still allowed to keep a legitimate trophy walleye or pike as long as it is frozen whole for the taxidermist. I have heard the owners strongly recommend taking a picture and along with some good measurments encourage people to have a replica made of that once in a lifetime fish. This I beleive is an excellent policy and has turned Gullrock and ajoining lakes into a first class fishery. Bud or Lee, maybe you could give us your take."
557710,Pikeslayer,2006-05-25 21:08:00,3,"I have to agree with Red Laker....I've been fishing in the Red Lake area for almost 20 years and I've seen more trophy Northern and Walleye pulled out of the frigid waters of Gullrock in the past 8 - 10 years than I've ever seen in my life. I believe this is a direct result of the policy enforced by the Gullrock camp owners. So hats off to all you guys....we are incredibly fortunate to have such a rich resource so close to home and it's even more important to preserve this remarkable resource for our own kids and grandkids. Good luck and good fishin' Slayer ""Everybody needs something to believe in - I believe I'll have another beer."""
557749,Guest,2006-05-26 20:03:00,0,"Yes, Wouldn't want anyone to think I keep the big ones. I'm a true conservationist. I believe that throwing the big ones back is very important in keeping the lakes plentiful for everyone. I enjoy my tournament fishing therefore I throw the big ones and the ones just under 18 inches. The rest is fair game.. And sometimes I just enjoy getting out there and catching and releasing... That's cause I'm too lazy to clean them... It's nothing to catch 50+ fish a day. So why would you want to keep those fat bellies anyway.. I've taking many people out and in my boat anything over 20 inchs goes back in the drink. If you want to keep a nineteen incher... go ahead your only aloud one... That's my policy.. I sort of gotten attached to those big ones. I catch em so often that I've started to give them names... So please leave my big pets alone! You can play with them but please release them after your done... Mista W"
