557821,ksboy2,2006-05-29 11:19:00,38,"i have fished the can. side of rainy twice. both times we stayed at coppen's camp. near bear pass. we did very good on smallmouth and pike. walleye were slow. it is a great place to fish. for smallmouth we hit windy points with rattle traps, spinnerbaits."
557679,Guest,2006-05-25 10:38:00,0,"I've fished numerous areas in NW Ontario for smallmouth, including LOTW and Rainy many times. The best smallmouth fishing in my opinion is currently on Rainy --> the North Arm of Rainy which is on the far Canadian side of the lake. The largest and most number of smallies are currently being caught there right now. The area doesn't get much fishing pressure due to it's remoteness. There are really only 2 resorts on that part of the lake (it's a long boat ride from the next closest resorts). The owners of the resorts cater mostly to smallmouth fishermen, although walleye is starting to also pick-up again in that part of the lake. They encourgage strictly catch and release, and know the true treasure that they have on that fishery--nice smallies. LOTW is pretty steady for smallmouth, but the North Arm of Rainy has become quite a treasure for them over the past few years. ....smallmouth are my passion! Chuck"
557684,Guest,2006-05-25 11:49:00,0,"Chuck, Can you tell me the names of the resorts. We are catch/release bass fishermen(although we like to eat walleye/panfish)who have the same passion as yourself...smallmouth's."

557707,Guest,2006-05-25 20:47:00,0,"Yep, LaBelles and the other is Camp Narrows. LaBelles is right at the boat ramp on Hwy 613. To get to Camp Narrows, you go to the ramp and launch your boat, and then head east by water for about 7 miles--it is right in the middle of the North Arm. LaBelles is more convient if you periodically need to go into Ft. Francis. But Camp Narrows is closest to the best smallie fishing, and saves considerable time going back and forth each day. In fact, some of the best smallie fishing is only 4 miles or so by water from Camp Narrows--down by the series of islands south east of there. Like LOTW, the North Arm can get pretty rough at times, so keep an eye on the wind/weather. A southerly wind will run right down the middle of the arm, while east-west winds run on the section between LaBelles and Camp Narrows. Owners at both resorts are very friendly. Chuck"
557708,Guest,2006-05-25 20:49:00,0,"The link for Camp Narrows is:http://www.campnarrows.ca/ You'll need to book early, because both resorts fill up about a year ahead of time! Chuck"
557714,Guest,2006-05-26 05:56:00,0,"Chuck, Thank You, I found them and sent them a request for literature for a possible fall trip and a trip the 1st part of June 07."
557744,Guest,2006-05-26 18:28:00,0,"Best Ive ever found was The Labrynith Bays, Shoal Lake Narrows on Lake of the Woods. The Western Peninsula. There are a few resorts that service this area. Ash Rapids Lodge http://www.ashrapidslodge.com Shoal Lake Lodge http://www.shoallakelodge.net/ and North West Outfitters. http://www.lakeofthewoodsoutfitters.com/ This area has more superb smallmouth fishing than any other part of LOTW. Both Lg and Smallmouth but smallmouth rules. Catches of 80 per day are NOT uncommon, weights can be close to 5lb but average 2. Top water is on now until Mid June, and after that it's off the points If you can find better, I will eat my shirt."
557746,Guest,2006-05-26 18:38:00,0,"I agree, the Western Penn on LOTW is probably the best we've seen on LOTW. I've been there a couple of times in the past 4 years, and have always had nice smallmouth action. The 80 per day in the previous post is ""per person."" Decent walleye fishing for eaters too. Chuck"
557761,Guest,2006-05-27 06:42:00,0,"Thanks for mentioning that. 80 per day is certainly possible. In fact my best has/was a 5 day trip. We caught and release over 100 per day. Now remember here a bass was a bass. But they people I too caught them on top, sub surface, fly rod, name it. It was a blast. and happens reasonably often and Lg Mouth too will even show up for something different. I guided that area for 20 years and I know right now, I could go out tomorrow and pretty well catch an easy 80 smallies. Mind you, a ruddy storm just passed threw here so give it a few days now. A good Storm too. Tight Lines gents. Do have a good day on the water."
557791,Guest,2006-05-28 04:37:00,0,"shoal lake narrows, Do you work for a lodge or indpependent? My own thoughts are 80/day per person is pretty darn good. I would like to hear more."
557665,Guest,2006-05-25 07:46:00,0,Would like opinions on what your thoughts are for the best smallmouth in Canada? We typically go in June and was wondering about 2007? Thanks.
557666,Guest,2006-05-25 08:02:00,0,The best smallmouth fishing in Canada is found on smaller fly in lakes but if I were going to go to one of the bigger well known lakes to fish for them it would be Rainy Lake without a doubt.
557667,Guest,2006-05-25 08:06:00,0,"Wondering...also, if your interested in a couple really good fly-ins let me know, I've been to many over the years fishing specificaly for smallmouth."
557669,Guest,2006-05-25 08:38:00,0,Aaron: I am interested in the fly-in but it wouldn't be this year. I have also never been on Rainy but have fished LOTW.If you would rather me email just give me your email and I can reply.

557673,Guest,2006-05-25 09:04:00,0,"LOL, I'd never pass on a carp."
557676,Guest,2006-05-25 09:54:00,0,HMMMMM Having spent a week in Illinois one day I assume you work for the tourism dept?
557677,Guest,2006-05-25 10:18:00,0,"Hoosier, You got it. Good Luck with the Smallies."
557678,Guest,2006-05-25 10:24:00,0,"HMMMM Thx,I will give you an update when we return."
