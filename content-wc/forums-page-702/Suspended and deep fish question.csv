Overall, the walleye seemed to be in a neutral-to-negative mood. The area we fish is mostly moderate depth, with the deepest water being a couple isolated and fairly small holes of 30-35'. I noticed on the sonar that there were often a lot of fish near these deeper pockets. Some were suspended at 15-20' down over 30', others were grouped near the bottom in 30'. We spent a little time trying to get these fish, but had very modest success. We got an occasional fish trolling crawler rigs around 10-15ft over the deeper water, trolling crankbaits yielded none. Tried vertical jigging and lindy rigs on the deeper fish (which appeared to be larger) but no luck. We were able to get fair numbers of ""eaters"" in more structure-oriented spots (points, narrows, islands, etc.) in shallower water. But nothing > 24 inches. Anyone have ideas on effective ways to target these suspended/bottom hugging fish when they're grouped in small, isolated spots?"

The fish on the bottom looked pretty large: how big do whitefish get? They also could have been pike lying in cooler water, the surface temp was in the mid-to-high sixties."
