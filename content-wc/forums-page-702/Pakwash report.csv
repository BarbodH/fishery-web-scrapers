Walleye bite was steady had to move around alot. Lots of 15 to 17. Our last day we finally got into some nice 18+ biggest being 26"". We switched to old school hook, splitshot, bobber with a minnow casting in towards shore. Biggest pike for us was 36"". Caught lots of nice pike while walleye fishing. No problems at the border either way. They had one road block on 105. They had me roll down the windows they peaked in the car, walked to the back of the boat and said thank you."
