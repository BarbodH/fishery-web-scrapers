556909,WillieB,2006-05-05 10:50:00,292,"Judge rules against Minaki developer Failure to carry fire insurance cited in ruling By Mike Aiken Kenora Daily Miner and News Wednesday May 03, 2006 Justice Peter Jarvis has finally released his ruling on the ill-fated Minaki resort, and it goes against controversial developer Phil Archer. In his ruling, Jarvis criticized Archer for his lack of financial statements, failure to comply with an undertaking to produce records, as well as Archer's lack of fire insurance on the property. During a week-long civil trial last August, lawyers for a group of local contractors argued the mortgage on the resort wasn't valid, since it was held by another one of Archer's companies, Celestine. In his 10-page decision, the judge agreed with the plaintiffs. In summary, I find that Archer cared nothing for the lien claimants and decided that they should bear the risk of fire loss by failing to have Celestine insist on the placement of insurance, wrote the judge. The Jewel of the North burnt on Thanksgiving weekend in 2003. The historic main lodge was left a burnt out shell while the bedroom wing, built in the 1980s and several outbuildings and cabins remain. It has taken close to three years to sort out the ensuing legal tangle. During last summer's sensational trial, where Phil Archer testified in his own defence, Celestine was claiming first right of payment for its $5.9 million mortgage of the $7.1 million owing on the property, with contractors trying to reclaim the remaining $1.2 million. Principal claimant Vern Poschner of Parkland Plumbing in Kenora, who is owed $176,000, was pleased with the decision, but he was also quick to say it wasn't over, since they hadn't received any money from Archer. The good news is it's almost over, he said. For sure, I'll do whatever I have to in order to make sure lien claimants get their money, he added, noting further liens and the possibility of foreclosing on the property are still possibilities. Despite having financial troubles before the blaze gutted the main lodge and forced him into bankruptcy, Archer managed to buy back the property from the receiver last January. Terms of the transaction are confidential, and they have not been disclosed. At the time, Archer said he was handing the property over to former employees, because he didn't have the heart to return and manage the property. He was also serving a 60-day sentence at the time, and he was under house arrest, after he was convicted of breaching terms of his 15-year securities ban issued in 1991. Both the restaurant and golf course were scheduled to re-open this summer under new ownership. Former Archer employees Rod Wharram and golf pro Doug Johnston, who were unavailable for comment. The lawyer for the claimants, Jim Hook of Kenora, said the completion of the sale to Archer was imminent, but he wasn't able to elaborate on a closing date, terms of sale or amount paid."
