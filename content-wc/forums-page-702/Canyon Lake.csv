As far as the fishing goes, we caught very few walleye but a ton of nice bass and pike. The musky's were all over as well. They would come up to our trolling motor but wouldn't bite. Good Luck"

Great muskie fishing. Has smallmouth bass, but we seldom fish for them so can't comment on that. Not sure where the previous poster got the pike from because there aren't any in the lake. Let me know if you need more info."
557757,Guest,2006-05-27 00:28:00,0,I've been going to canyon for 5 years now. I won't let you bash John over at McIntosh. He runs a tight ship and a clean camp. There are 2 other lodges on the lake as well. One just sold and the other is run by a real grump. Canyon is a great lake for big Walleyes. Three of my top 8 personal bests have come from that lake. All 3 were over nine pounds. You can fish in the community holes and catch eaters or think outside the box and have a morning like we did a couple of years ago--With 8 fish in a 4 hr period between 25-29 inches. headed back the last week of june good luck B
