557734,Guest,2006-05-26 15:00:00,0,"Yes, Yes, Yes I am the son of a military member who did 2 tours at the local radar base and we use to fish Lac Seul regularly. Instead of putting in at deception travel farther north to mile 23 and put in. Fishing is great all the way down to the main lake. I have fished mainly on the Sioux Lookout and Hudson end of the lake. Minnows on a jig 'n grub worked wonders as did a minnow on a spinner. Just remeber to respect the lake as it can turn nasty on a moments notice."
557737,Guest,2006-05-26 15:29:00,0,Anybody who has to travel over 5 miles on Lac Seul to have great Walleye fishing is not a Walleye Fisherman.
557740,Guest,2006-05-26 17:08:00,0,"hmmmm, you are right to a point. i fish the other end of the lake at ear falls. i can catch tons of walleye within a couple of miles of camp. i do , however seem to catch nicer fish 7 miles away and know that the odds of my catching that elusive 30 incher improve after a 12 mile boat ride."
557743,Guest,2006-05-26 18:09:00,0,"Whit, I have fished the Ear Falls area for two weeks ...caught 2 30""+ fish within two miles of the railroad bridge. They are there if you look for them and fish structure that has a better chance of holding bigger fish."
557750,Guest,2006-05-26 20:25:00,0,"Could you give us some idea where you caught these? by the stumps past the bridge? Could I e-mail you? or you me- going up the 23 of June, staying at Evergreen. [email protected]"
556380,michigan eyes,2006-04-21 11:56:00,7,"Broad & Sunlight lakes are south of ghost narrows to the southeast, You have to go through Altimeter Creek a 1/4 mile or so till you connect into Broad Lake then towards the east of broad lake it connect to Sunlight Lake which is narrower and more shapely than Broad Lake (as the name implies). If I recall they used to keep a couple houseboats docked nearby the entrance cove to Altimeter creek but that was many years ago and We have not fished Broad/Sunlight for 5 yrs. or so. We stay up at McKenzie Bay and don't need to go much past the Sanbanks of the main lake. Hope that helps. Good Luck"
556382,Guest,2006-04-21 12:38:00,0,Thanks for the info. It is probably unlikely that we would make the trip all the way to Sunlight since we are staying up by Ear Falls - that would be quite a haul.

We call it ""houseboat cove"""
556457,reddog,2006-04-24 17:38:00,2158,"We used to daily go to Sunlight and Broad from Ear Falls. One day per trip, we usually ran to Vaughn Lake also. One of the funnest days fishing I had, was sitting on the bank at Altimeter creek/Broad Lake catching big suckers. They're about like catching redfish, and really put up a fight."
556497,Mike Kansas,2006-04-25 11:44:00,1463,We have always been able to find plenty of good Walleye fishing within short distance of where we stay on Lac Seul. We have stayed at several different resorts over the years and they all are more than eager to direct you to areas close that will produce excellent fishing. On occasion we do make some longer runs but its only because we want to have a day with a shore lunch and fish an area that we don't normally fish. Lac Seul is a Walleye factory and when you find the pattern that is working it can be a fishing frenzy. The majority of our fish are taken with jig/minnow.
556664,Guest,2006-04-27 15:48:00,0,Is the fishing really better at Chamberlain? That sure is a long ways.
556710,schick,2006-04-29 14:03:00,35,I fished Chamberlain Narrows for 2 years and then moved west on the lake. I do not know how the walleye fishing could be any better anywhere than in that current flowing through Chamberlain Narrows.
557661,Guest,2006-05-25 06:01:00,0,we r located near vauhan lake we r at the mouth of it it is not a long haul from dryden 807 582 9622 or 807 582 3903 Brian Jack we are 142 on the canadain fishing map give us a call first year in business

556347,FlyBoy,2006-04-19 21:27:00,631,Yes. Rent a house boat! -John
556349,tly,2006-04-19 21:48:00,1900,"With the expected gas prices a houseboat is not a real simple solution They are not cheap to run or rent. They sure are alot of fun though. The up side is you ccan bring your stuff in vans, etc without the added expense of the boat (we have always taken our boats though) so you coculd potentially save some $$$ there. You spend 1st day going to ..... You spend you r last day going to base You just got cheated out of 2 days fishing. What we have done is desinate two losers, one to drive outm the other to return. The rest of the group ccan fish and motor to Hudson or ccatch up. The down side there is that they are using gas per boat as well as the big boat. It is all fun TLY"
556350,orchard frank,2006-04-19 23:31:00,1900,"There are a lot of fish between the landing and Sen Bay. Some people are more comfortable with the long runs to get to familiar spots, or enjoy the sights, but good fishing is available in many places that most people just bomb right by. When we first started going in the early 90's, I did a lot of running. 10 years later I would barely get out of sight of camp most days, unless I felt like a ride. Different times of the year are going to affect fish locations, but one thing I think is under used is shallow patterns for walleye, SAND, weeds, and timber. On flat calm, bright sunny days, try fishing as shallow as 2-3'down to 8-10'or so, it can change your thinking. Good Luck"
556361,michigan eyes,2006-04-20 13:57:00,7,We boat- in Outpost on NW sect. of Lac Seul. No need to look for fish when your 1-1/12 hr. away from any resorts/launches etc. Only the nicer days we see people fishing by us but we go back and nap during the day and fish early morn & till dusk mostly. I'd say the same groups we see every year if the weather is nice but if its nasty out people don't make the long full-day trips 20-30 miles. After out-posting the last 9 yrs. I don't think I'd really want to go if we didn't stay so far out of the way of towns/resorts. People drive a long way to come up just to fish If the waters up like last year.
556362,Guest,2006-04-20 14:08:00,0,"You can find many threads on this topic if you search. The first year I went to Lac Seul we did the same thing, put-in at Deception, drove to Sen Bay. Being a newbie I couldn't understand why we were wasting so much time traveling. Especially since I was in a 14 ft aluminum with a 15 on it. (took us a loooonnggg time) Basically it was my In-laws trip and they used to camp in Sen Bay so that is the area they were most familiar with. We now stay at a resort on the water near Vaughan Lake so traveling isn't an issue. Personally I don't feel that much travel is necessary on a lake like that. Regards,"
556366,Guest,2006-04-20 18:35:00,0,"I always think the fishing is better on the other side of the lake..but in this lake, the fish are just about everywhere. We fish the NW side too and take our daily run about 20 miles. The ride and view are half the fun. I just wish we could still camp on the lake."
556367,180FH,2006-04-20 19:05:00,444,orchard frank makes a lot of sense.....
556376,Guest,2006-04-21 09:11:00,0,"My first time at Lac Seul we fished 45 minutes minumum, and several days over an hour to get to Sunlight Lake to fish. We were staying at Scout Lake and several days into the trip it looked like a lightning storm was going to head our way so we just stayed in Scout Lake and worked the weed edges. Caught a ton of fish 100 yards from the dock/ I like Sunlight and Broad lake, the big sandbanks and big island, my favorite shorelunch spot being the island on Sunlight, but I do not think it is necessary to go an hour+ to find fish."
556379,Guest,2006-04-21 11:22:00,0,Where is Sunlight Lake? My maps aren't showing it (I only have the NW and SW sections)
