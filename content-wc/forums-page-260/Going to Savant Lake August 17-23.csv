4098689,DrJim,2015-08-03 12:47:00,1,I'm going to Savant Lake for the first time august 17-23 and could use any advice from the vets who go there. I talked to the camp manager a couple days ago so have some idea of what the lake is like. Some questions I have are : Is the narrows a reliable evening walleye producer. Is the lake worth fishing south of the narrows for pike and lakers or is all the action north of there. I'm taking some down riggers to go for lakers and wondering how deep they would be in mid august. Thanks for all the help guys. DrJim

Have never had a reason to fish further north. Would like to see that part of the lake someday though.If you are staying at Wildewood there is a lot of good fishing from Pine Island south. It takes forty five minutes from WW to get to the north end of ""the wall"". At this time of year we spend a lot of time from the narrows north to Pine Island and the islands north of the wall towards Bear Paw. Evenings we tend to fish from Big Sandy to the south and south of the narrows.Cliff and Roma's or Cat Track are located in the most convenient spot to reach both ends of the lake. That said, if you are staying at Wildewood, don't feel you need to travel north to get into fish. Our last day was Thursday and Rick (bobo on WC) and Doc caught and released 138 walleye by fishing north of Big Sandy in the morning and not far from the Wildewood Bay entrance in the evening. They put over fifty fish in the boat in a couple hours that evening and were only ten minutes from camp. (Not in the narrows area) Not a bad day in anyone's book. I've never done that in one day.Unless things have changed by the time DrJim gets on the lake, don't waste too much time fishing the bays. Fish the more open water areas around islands, points, humps. As long as there is deep water available nearby there should be fish in the area somewhere.We jigged more than usual this trip and I've never seen so many fish caught that initially were invisible on the depth finder. The fish were flat on the bottom within the rocks and invisible. Numerous times I thought the area was devoid of fish only to drop a jig down and see walleye ""appear"" out of nowhere to take the jig. It was like watching a video game. Once a fish was hooked it stirred up the school and we suddenly had marks all over the screen. The fish were absolutely there and you just had to give them a chance to show themselves. That's where experience on the water helps immensely. Just to know in your mind that there should be fish there and have the nads to stay there and move around until you find them or prove to yourself that they are not there before moving on to the next spot.I fish Savant for usually two weeks a year and make two trips to Lac Seul each year. I'm convinced that Savant is a miniature Lac Seul. Both are the best lakes I've ever fished in Canada, but they fish very differently. Fish size and numbers are similar.Have a good trip and sorry for the lengthy reply.Pooch"

Probably not any better than the stuff we had 10 minutes from camp, but it's always fun marking new hot spots!"
