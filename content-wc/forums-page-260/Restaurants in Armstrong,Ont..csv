4116721,phishfearme,2015-08-10 13:46:00,1242,we had dinner and breakfast at Gail's on July 16/17 and had pretty good food and just fine service. prices were reasonable and they took credit cards - MUCH better than dirtying and cleaning up our cabin at Mattice. your choice phish
4116793,Walleyeski,2015-08-10 14:09:00,40,"The last two fall trips have been to the Armstrong area. We have dined at Gail's each time, very good food and service. Our group likes the old pictures on the walls. Last year we got there early enough to drive around in the old air base."
4116825,adempsey,2015-08-10 14:23:00,963,I did some armchair research on Armstrong a little while back and this is all I found:Gail's Grill and Bakery 5 King Street 807-583-1212 E&J Restaurant and Lounge 46 Queen Street 807-583-1265 Chateau North Grill 15-16 King Street 807-583-2000Not sure what's open though.
4118321,Ogoki,2015-08-11 04:08:00,291,"Thanks Mike and Pikeslayer. Will report back but I can't write like Mike . We had a good breakfast at Gails in Armstrong last trip up, about three weeks ago. Chateau North had a closed sign on the door . Checked again when I came out. There was a pay phone there that I used while bear hunting to call home. Was checking on that. But now there is cell service in the Armstrong area. So for $30 a month i can get Verizon cell service . 1000 minutes and unlimited text. Early on I made the mistake of making a cell call from somewhere above Lake Superior and the roaming charges were unreal. With Verizon dial *611 , from here in the States , the day before your trip for the coverage"
4118425,Whopper,2015-08-11 05:33:00,340,"Sounds like a great trip Keith, good luck! We probably should touch base after you return To the OP, our group usually takes grill food and prepares right at the cabin. After a 20 hour drive the food is great and the beer tastes better."
4118585,Jeler,2015-08-11 06:41:00,92,"I agree, we'll probably spend the evening by the grill and a few cold ones.Have a safe trip Keith, sounds like quite the adventure.We're flying out Saturday morning.Jeff"
4119369,Ogoki,2015-08-11 10:06:00,291,"Jeff, I am nosey , what lake you going to ?"
4119441,Jeler,2015-08-11 10:36:00,92,Pringle for 5 days!
4120929,Ogoki,2015-08-11 19:19:00,291,"Phil, I will phone you when I get back."
4115201,Jeler,2015-08-10 05:07:00,92,"We'll be spending an evening in Armstrong prior to flying out with MLO.It's been quite a few years since I've been up there and am wonderingif anyone might have a recommendation on a restaurant. Tried doing a search and ""possibly"" found a couple places that offer food, but I'm not positive they are still operating.ThanksJeff"
4115321,phishfearme,2015-08-10 05:41:00,1242,there's really only one place to eat - Gail's on the left as you get into town. phish
4115673,jveri,2015-08-10 07:43:00,70,"Eat in thunder bay before heading north LOL, we ate once in armstrong and its nothing to write home about."
4115801,Mike Borger,2015-08-10 08:44:00,1554,Are you staying in one of Don's cabins on Mattice Lake the night before? If so you can always bring something to throw on the bbq and cook yourself.
4115937,Jeler,2015-08-10 09:46:00,92,"Hi MikeYes we are staying in one of MLO's cabin the evening before.Had given some thought to bringing something along to cook up thereand by the sounds of it, that may be the way to go.I hope you're having a great summer and thanks againfor all your helpJeff"
4116097,lightning rod,2015-08-10 10:36:00,15,"It’s been 20 years or more but the last time I tried to east breakfast in Armstrong we could not get anyone to take our order. Only 3 groups in the restaurant and they seemed to only take orders from locals. We finally got food but we did not feel welcome. On the way home we stopped at the only gas station, if you could call it that, between Armstrong and the highway and wouldn’t you know it the bathrooms were “broke”. So we decided our wallets were broke too. That was a long time ago, and yes we were being polite visitors except when we decided to not spend about $60 on snacks and sodas. I also learned on that trip to never fly with a pilot whose nickname is Cowboy. All other experiences over the years in Canada have been great."
4116385,Pikeslayer8,2015-08-10 12:12:00,1460,We had pretty good bush food here at the Chateu North. I loved the experience. Ya just got to appreciate being there. I remember the time I pulled into Armstrong. I musta looked like a Japanese tourist with my camera clicking at everything. I was as happy to be there as a young kid under the Christmas tree.
4116401,Ogoki,2015-08-10 12:14:00,291,"I second Mike's thoughts on cooking something yourself at MLO guest cabis . We even pack a cooler with food and snacks for the trip up. We come thru the Soo and have had poor , expensive meals along the way. My wife even pcks some cheese , summer sausage and crackers fir the drive home. Now we also stop at Tim Hortons at the Soo, Wawa and at Nipigon. I even take along a thermos for Tim' s coffee. Getting packed to head up to Armstrong this Saturday. 1150 mile trip by myself. Going to be bear hunting and fishing east of Armstrong out the logging roads. If you get real hungry for a good breakfast , I plan to eat blueberry pancakes and bacon every morning. Walleye for supper after the evening hunt. Come look me up . Then to Quetico for 10 days of canoeing and fishing . 3 1/2 weeks out of 4 , I will be in northern Ontario. Life is GOOD"
4116457,Pikeslayer8,2015-08-10 12:24:00,1460,"Dang Keith, that sounds like a crazy awesome adventure.... Sure would like to hear how it went. I tell you what, if I had the chance to share a campfire with Ogoki, I'd be jumpin on that."
4116625,Mike Borger,2015-08-10 13:21:00,1554,"Sounds like a lot of fun Keith, enjoy your trips and stay safe!"
