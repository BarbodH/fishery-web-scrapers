4122401,LoDo,2015-08-12 11:41:00,721,If you plan to fish 20' to 35' of water for walleyes and assume little wind what size jig would you recommend? Is 1/4 to 3/8 enough? Do you need to get to 1/2?
4122457,Golden Eagle,2015-08-12 12:13:00,2642,I suggest using the lightest jig that will get to the bottom.

4122793,fish007,2015-08-12 14:47:00,120,The more vertical your presentation the less snags and also the easiest to feel a bite. It all depends on drift speed of course. 3/8 oz should work most of the time and if you can anchor 1/4 should be fine. I keep some 1/2 oz jigs in my box but don't need to go that heavy very often. I don't like to fish a medium weight rod but you almost have to going that deep with heavier jigs
4122921,camp chef,2015-08-12 15:11:00,915,My fishing partner and I have been fishing together for over 40 years. He prefers the lightest jig he can get away with and I prefer the heaviest jig I can get away with in any given situation. In most cases our jigs are 1/8 oz different. Over the years there has been no discernible difference in the number or size of the Walleyes we catch.(Don't tell him I said that). The point is I think it best to fish with what you are most comfortable with given the conditions and fishes desires on any particular day.
4124713,deadhead1,2015-08-13 09:33:00,193,I used to use 3/8 but bought some 1/4 by mistake and don't see much difference. Heavier is better if windy. I have never had a need for 1/2 oz. If you like to cast and drag back then the 1/4 probably has less snags but less distance.
4124849,BornToFish,2015-08-13 10:37:00,1224,"As mentioned above, I always the lightest jig that allows me to feel bottom. I am presently fishing in NW Ontario in 28-30 fow with 1/16 ounce jigs. I may switch to 1/8 ounce jigs in September when the wind blows. I can't recall the last time that I used 1/4 ounce jigs or heavier, but am sure that it would have been over rocks as I don't care if I lose such heavy jigs. In my opinion, anglers that regularly fish with heavy jigs to feel bottom (under the conditions set forth in the originating post) are probably missing bites due to too heavy a power of rod and/or too heavy fishing line. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4125209,jimirjr,2015-08-13 12:38:00,1149,"Same here.... 1/8 oz. is THE STANDARD for me when Walleye fishing... I use the BOAT to present My jigs by backtrolling.... Of course, my partners usually utilize heavier jigs..."
4125729,lassh,2015-08-13 16:32:00,553,"I've found that the fish in lakes above and below the one you fish usually prefer the jig right on the bottom. The more vertical your line is, the more fish you'll hook. If there are light winds a 1/8 to 1/4 will be fine down to 32 feet. If the winds are strong however, as they usually are up there, you will have trouble keeping the jig down while maintaining any semblance of vertical. I'd bring maybe 10 3/8 oz and maybe 4 or 5 1/2 oz. jigs. I haven't fished that area in August, but did fish Hammerhead in a hot July once. Very hot, bright skies and the best bite was in shallow rocks (3 to 6 feet) at 1 PM. Go figure! If you fish the Donald Falls area, a 1/8 oz jig on light line cast across land retrieved just above the bottom was very effective. Its a timing thing to not get snagged in the rocks. We actually quit going down there because the fishing was too easy. Another great bait that sometimes outproduces jigs is the Mepps Syclops spoon with twister trailer. Have a great trip!"
