4103985,SinOrSwim,2015-08-05 06:41:00,1528,"Ask if they do check flights? Ours always did a couple check flights. If we thought we needed something, there was a dry erase board we could write on and they would bring us what we requested. The other thing to do is split what you take up by the days you are there. Take that first amount out the first day. If you burn through it, definitely see if the outfitter can bring you more. If not, you can be confident you will make it through the trip."
4119297,sweeperq,2015-08-11 09:51:00,21,"Thanks for all the feedback guys. Just got back from D'Alton. 1 lb of leeches and 8 doz crawlers would have been close, but the couple heading out had extras that they gave us Was my first time to Canada and it was a blast. Almost every spot we pulled up to produced a couple of fish (either walleye or pike). But there were definitely a couple honey holes where the fish were just stacked up. I've never seen anything like it, except for maybe catching small panfish off the end of a pier. The main difference was that instead of 4-6"" bluegill it was 16-19"" walleye with many 20""+ fish mixed in. Will definitely have to do that again"

4120881,Blades-n-Beads,2015-08-11 18:50:00,484,"Sweep, take a full flat if your going for 7 days, last thing you want to do is run out of bait."
4100865,sweeperq,2015-08-04 08:01:00,21,Will be doing my first fly in to Northwestern Ontario here in a couple days. Wondering what the bait quantity recommendations are for 4 guys and 4 days of fishing for walleye? One of the guys in the group pre-ordered 1 lb or leaches and 8 dozen crawlers. Thoughts?
4101097,ftfarms,2015-08-04 08:58:00,444,We always take a flat of worms for 4 guys. (A flat is 40 dozen) and we have gulp alive artifical minnows and artificial leeches from northland tackle. It all works out well for us.
4101129,sweeperq,2015-08-04 09:09:00,21,"Is that flat for a 4 day trip, or a week? Thanks for the feedback."
4101281,ftfarms,2015-08-04 10:01:00,444,Sorry that's for a week. I would say five dozen per man would be sufficient. Maybe four with a pound of leeches. cant depend on leeches staying alive enless you got a live bait cooler with aerator
4101289,pjshorthorn,2015-08-04 10:03:00,5654,We just returned from a 7 day trip with 4 guys in the group. We took a 1/2 flat ( 250 crawlers ) and had plenty. PjShorthorn
4101649,sweeperq,2015-08-04 11:41:00,21,"Thanks for the advice fellas. Sounds like we should probably double our order, or get a 1/2 flat."
4101737,SinOrSwim,2015-08-04 12:15:00,1528,"Try to figure it out and then add about 25 to 50% to what you think. The price of extra bait is a small price compared to the cost of the trip. There are a couple things you don't want to run out of on a fly-in. Bait and beer. We have had experience with both. Then, if you WAY over did it, adjust on your next trip. not sure if you take minnows but we always took a mesh collapsible minnow bucket. put minnows in there, put a rock in it and sink it off the end of the dock. They will stay alive really well. We had trips where minnows were the key! We got tot he point we would take the skanky floaters out and lay them on the boat seat to dry out so we could use them."

4103137,pan-man,2015-08-04 18:32:00,299,"I do a five day trip by myself pulling spinners with crawlers. I go between 250-400 crawlers. I catch anywhere from 75 to 125 fish a day. Sometime I catch 3-4 walleyes per worm and sometimes it takes 3 worms to catch 1. I would over buy vs under buy. Worms are cheap!! Always can give excess bait to next group coming in. Also gulp 6"" crawlers and pork 7"" crawlers work good (75% as good as crawlers)."
4103225,jkaup,2015-08-04 18:54:00,56,"What lake and outfitter are you going with? We always have better luck on minnows. Once you figure the walleye out, cut each into 3 or 4 pieces and use a bare jig with a piece of minnow. Minnows out fish worms and leaches for us 3 to 1. Have fun!"
