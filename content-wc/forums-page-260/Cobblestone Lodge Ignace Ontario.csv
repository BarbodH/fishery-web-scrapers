4126737,reidcb,2015-08-14 06:55:00,24,"I found the keel sinker method to work and was glad to add a tool in the tool box. However, the bottom bouncers caught 20% more fish. We did not troll any plugs. We also used jig and minnow. Cliff assured us that this would not work. We caught fish. I was glad that I had read about Cliff first. He really didn't bother me like he did some others on this site. I wish we would have had some better weather. I generally go to Ignace on the third week of September. The weather was good for several years. Then we had two bad years. So we are going to start going earlier. Next year we may go the last week of August. It will depend on my brother-in-law's schedule."
4026546,toja9801,2015-07-06 19:56:00,6,"Anyone out there have recent experience with Cobblestone Lodge near Ignace? A buddy and I are heading up in about a month. I've seem some other feedback from a few years back that was interesting to say the least so wondering if anyone has been there since and what kind of experience they had. Any info on the lakes, resort, etc are greatly appreciated!"
4027409,HeHooksHimself,2015-07-07 07:23:00,725,"My BIL fishing buddy and I go to different places in the fall to gain different experiences. In 2011 we went to Cobblestone in September. We had been warned that Cliff was a little ""different"" and we found that to be the case. That being said, we enjoyed our experience. First of all, the lake the lodge is on has only trout. He is set up for trout fishing, but we chose to fish a different lake every day. He has caches of boats on a variety of lakes. Once you get to the lake you are fishing, his equipment is adequate and in good repair, but the roads to these lakes we found to be pretty hard on our vehicle plus you spend quite a bit on gas. Cliff is very adamant that you fish only with a keel sinker and a spinner that he rigs up and sells you pretty much at cost. He has disdain for jig fishing and is not afraid to tell you that. In his defense, he wants you to catch fish and is quite convinced that his rig backtrolled is the only way to fish and any other method is a waste of time. We complied and used his method with reasonable success. We enjoyed fishing a different lake every day but obviously some of the day is spent exploring. He will let you know where to fish but hey, nothing is guaranteed. When we returned each day Cliff was there to talk about our experience and insisted upon cleaning our fish, which he did very well. As you might suspect, he is quite convinced that his method of cleaning fish was the the only way to do it and any other method of fish cleaning is a waste of time. We were fine with that since he did a great job. We found the camp itself to be clean and well kept, but the cabins are very close together and you can't really ever feel like you are remote. The camp is close enough to the highway that you can hear the drone of trucks through the night. While Cliff is pretty intense we would consider trying it again except for the beating my vehicle took (Nissan Frontier 4WD that I have since traded in). The access roads do not belong to Cliff (he seems to think they do) and he insists that you travel fast on them in order to smooth them out, but it is dangerous since they are single lane and there are many blind corners and hills. I guess at my age I prefer to get to the camp and work from there instead of my truck. In any case, just enjoy the experience and don't let Cliff annoy you, just find the humor in it. Fish On! Hooks"
4027609,toja9801,2015-07-07 08:15:00,6,"Thanks for the detailed review, Hooks! Sounds like the travel to/from the lakes will be an adventure in itself. Also sounds like smile and nod is the name of the game. Did you chase anything but walleye? Any of the lakes that you would rank as a ""must fish"" over the others? Any special equipment (lets call rods and typical tackle a given) you would make sure to bring?This will be my first of hopefully many trips north of the border...very much looking forward to it!"
4028457,HeHooksHimself,2015-07-07 12:30:00,725,"If this is your first trip I guarantee it won't be your last. Don't be afraid to experiment. You cannot fish a Canadian lake without catching some pike and we caught a few of them. We fished for trout in Hawk Lake but couldn't seem to scare them up with the spoons we were using. I can't remember catching any smallmouth that trip, but they seem to be in most lakes these days. We did not fish on Raleigh Lake (Lake trout only) but Arethusa and Kukusus have boat ramps and others, mostly locals, fish there. We also fished Sally Lake and caught a few. We did like the solitude of Hawk Lake and did well on the 2nd lake. We did have our stringer untie itself from our boat here (I swear, I tied it myself) so we lost our carefully chosen walleye to the depths. So if you pull up a stinger with skeletons on it, that is ours!. Fish On! Hooks"
4030169,toja9801,2015-07-08 06:39:00,6,Really appreciate the insights on the lakes you fished! Will let you know if we snag a stringer!
4117809,reidcb,2015-08-10 19:48:00,24,"We just got back from Cobblestone. We stayed at the outpost. It was fun. It has solar lights and propane for the frig, stove, hot water, etc. It sits up in the woods. There is about a 10 minute walk to Kakukus and a 5 minute walk to Godden. You cannot see the lakes from the outpost. The boats and motors were good. I rented the depth finder for $10 for the week. They would not allow us to check in before 4pm on Saturday. We found bottom bouncers to work better than the keel sinkers recommended by Cliff. He is a little different. It rained on the check out day. Therefore, we had to unload the cottage and drive the boat and jeep out in the rain. It caused a delay and we didn't make it back to the lodge by the 10 am check out time. Cliff blew his top. I was expecting it due to what I had read here. However, the whole experience was awesome. We saw a minimum of 5 boats a day on Kakukus. Therefore, it is not as remote as they lead you to believe. I hope you have a great trip."
4122601,toja9801,2015-08-12 13:06:00,6,"Thanks for sharing reid...thinking we may have been one of the other boats you saw on Kukukus last Monday 8/3. Got back from our trip late last week. Overall had a lot of fun on the trip. Fished 4 of the lakes that Cobblestone has boats on. ..Hawk, Kukuskus, Raleigh, and Sally. Had the best luck on Hawk and Kukuskus. As suspected we found numerous traditional methods of walleye fishing to work. Cliff's keel sinker and spinner setup did catch fish but certainly not the only method for success. The drive out to the lakes does take longer than anticipated and the roads are rough...drink your coffee before the drive or you'll be wearing it. The lodging was fine...a place to drink a few few beers and rest your head at night. Wish they had a microwave in the kitchen but we certainly didn't go hungry. Biggest disappointment was that the reports on the resort owner (Cliff) were spot on. His way or the highway is the best way to sum up any interactions with him. Also wish he was more realistic in setting expectations when sending us out to the lakes. I didn't expect to catch 40+ fish per hour but that is what he says will happen if you're doing things right. Then when we told him what we caught he acted like we were the worst fisherman he'd ever had at the resort. I'm no pro but I know we fished hard and know what we're doing so it's almost maddening to get that reaction...even if you know he's of his rocker. Bottom line we caught fish and had fun. Will be checking out other accommodations on our next trip."
4122769,HeHooksHimself,2015-08-12 14:42:00,725,"I must say, Cliff is great at cleaning fish. Of course, if you clean fish any other way than his way, you are doing it all wrong. Glad you had fun, we came away with about the same attitude as you, which I read as ""Well, that was interesting...I mean I am glad I went but I will probably look elsewhere next year...."""
4126585,Skywagon,2015-08-14 05:40:00,1106,"Toja9801, did you fish the second lake at Hawk or just the first?"
4126689,toja9801,2015-08-14 06:39:00,6,We fished both lakes at Hawk. Had great luck early in the day in the first deep bay as you're heading out from the first lake...the weed line along the north shore and the rocky point directly to the south of that. On the second lake took us a while to find the fish. Tried Cliff's hot spots first without much luck then figured we'd try the other side of the lake (downwind) and got in to a lot of fish. We had the best luck on the SE side of second lake with a fairly stiff wind out of the NW...just be careful down there as we found that to be one of the rockiest shores and fish were definitely relating to the boulders there.
