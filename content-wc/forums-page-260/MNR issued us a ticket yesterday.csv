The adults could have used that opportunity to point out that LEO's have some compassion and they are not all just out to give out tickets/collect money for their government. It could have and should have been expressed that the officers ""could"" have fined them, but didn't. I think the message would have still gotten across to the kids and it would have stuck with them.."
4107177,Mike Kansas,2015-08-06 09:33:00,1463,I agree 100%. You handled this the way it should have been done and it will be a good lesson for all of the fisherman with you and all of us who read your post. I have been stopped on Lac Seul 3 times in 33 years and all was good each time. We did have two guys with us once who brought into camp several Smallmouth before it was open season. They made an honest mistake because believe it or not they thought they were Walleye. It was two new guys and they took a lot of raspberries from the rest of us and they felt pretty stupid. If they had been stopped by MNR I'm sure the MNR would have looked at them with amazement when they told him they thought they had Walleye. Mike Kansas
4110369,emma17,2015-08-07 14:21:00,436,"bthomas I do understand the business angle you are taking on this, in that you believe tourism would be negatively impacted by overly strict enforcement. In your example of Vegas, I agree with your position. However, when it comes to Canada/Ontario fishing, I think the impact would be opposite of your scenario, and here is why: One of the main reasons I'm willing to travel 12-16 hours (and I know many others travel much further than that) is because I feel I'm much less likely to have a full week of bad fishing. The primary reason I'm confident I won't have a full bad week of fishing is because I believe Canada/Ontario has made a full commitment to protecting the fishery. In fact, if it became common knowledge that the MNR folks were letting people ""off the hook"" for violations, I'd be less likely to make the trip and spend the money. I want that fishery protected."

4114257,LLewellin,2015-08-09 14:36:00,1790,Some are saying what a great teachable moment.... I agree kind of...... But could it also have been a great teachable moment for the MNR officers as representatives of the Canadian government/people and showing they are happy that you are there visiting and bringing tourism dollars to a place come January that is all but closed up? Maybe put on your salesman's hat and point out the infraction and look at the boys and tell them that this WILL cost you or your Dad's $185 next time you do not take care when measuring your fish??? Are we glad they put the fear of Law enforcement into those kids? Just saying there are more than one way to skin a cat
4114585,BreezyPoint,2015-08-09 16:49:00,1581,I think the teachable moment here on Walleye Central has more impact.Frank

Every time I encounter an officer of the law weather its the highway patrol, local sheriffs Dept or a game warden its a teachable moment and being that the officers are a public servant they should but don't always look at it that way. IMHO"
4114729,mikdor,2015-08-09 18:28:00,1,Very good attitude although it was an honest mistake its still against the law. I hope the rest of Your trip made You forget about the mistake.
4116393,LOW1,2015-08-10 12:13:00,2828,"In my view, law enforcement functions best when it achieves the desired result while at the same time inflicting the least amount of retribution/punishment necessary. In the situation of the OP. where there clearly was no intent to violate the law, the issuance of a warning would have been just as effective. The officer, although clearly within his authority to issue a ticket, should and could have performed his job more effectively by issuing a warning. This is not Canada bashing, just constructive criticism."

And yes, fish do shrink when put on ice. The larger the fish the larger the unit of measurement it can shrink. A warden recruit in my area tested this theory on varying sizes of walleyes and that is what his experiment concluded. It was an eye opener to many CO's"
4103905,bigwalleye1,2015-08-05 06:09:00,2632,"You did the right thing, and a good lesson for the younger anglers in the party.

4104281,3M TA3,2015-08-05 08:03:00,2846,"This was an interesting comment so I went out to the boat to check. 5 years ago I got one of those vinyl ones but cut off all the advertising that left only the ruler portion. I stuck it on the bottom portion of the gunnel track on my Lund. It's always out and available. Anyway. It measures the same as my metal yoyo tape. As much as I use that I should probably compare it to another tape just in case it too has stretched. Back on topic, stretching just an 1/8 of an inch in 18 inches doesn't seem like much but as the OP stated, an 1/8 of an inch is actually a lot, $185 a lot.. Definitely worth a check to make sure."
4104721,bthomas3333,2015-08-05 10:16:00,465,I'm pretty sure they have 'j' walking rules in MN too. Maybe they should be writing tickets if someone's toe is 1/8 inch over the curb before or after the walk sign changes. Thanks for insulting 2 million people. Great way to have an intelligent conversation.

4104793,MrSimon,2015-08-05 10:42:00,922,Are we really even discussing the comparison between J walking in Vegas to keeping walleye in northern Ontario? I couldn't think of two more unrelated subjects. The internet never ceases to amaze me.

4105953,MorganMan,2015-08-05 19:41:00,341,"I think it's the thought process in the land up north. Yes, it is against the rules to keep a fish too big. Can't be upset if caught. But, at the border, it's up to an agent's mood to see if you get in? No rules, just a judgment call if the person trying to enter has a dui in the states which is felony in Canada? My take, I'm in a foreign country, just say yes or no to questions and let them decide what rules they will enforce to the fullest extent of the law and which ones they won't. It's a different expectation for a service industry there in my 20+ years of travel. I have seen extremely hospitable service and rude arrogance that we were lucky to have been able to pay them money for our use of their service/facilites. Our problem is that we typically go at the end of the season....maybe tired of dealing with Americans? Ha."

You are allowed one fish over the slot. Most of us expand this slot range to 17.5 to 21.5 on our own so that there is less chance of a fish being stretched, shrunk or mis-measured into the ""you just got busted slot size."""

Why would we give these officers a hard time - especially when we had our kids with us, we don't want to do anything that would have us not allowed back into the country next year, and the officer did show us his wooden measuring device with tape measure on the inside.

4101905,bthomas3333,2015-08-04 12:58:00,465,A law was broken. No serious crime was committed. I think it is exactly the same as a 'J' walking offense. We just choose to be a little more forgiving when it comes to a crime that is just a simple mistake. Like I said. If you are polite and respectful of the officer. You didn't intentionally break the law (the 26 inch fish over) I don't think someone should be fined. That is my opinion. It might help our tax revenue in the short term by writing tickets for j walking but the longer term impact is potentially not what you are looking for. B-
4101929,tv4fish,2015-08-04 13:05:00,2694,"OH --- It's pretty darn impressive. The last time we were checked, they pulled out a V-trough thing made out of wood with a metal ruler attached to the inside of it. I don't think you would want to argue about whether it was accurate or not.............."
4101985,SinOrSwim,2015-08-04 13:16:00,1528,"I would have asked them to measure on the ruler I was using. If it was only 1/8 over, what if my ruler was off?

Just a little food for thought, an 18"" walleye would be 144 one eight's of an inch long. This fish was 145 one eight's of an inch. What does that amount too? About 3/4 of one percent over the limit? Kinda like a cop giving you a ticket for traveling 70.25 MPH in a 70 MPH zone. I don't think even Buford T. Justice of Smokey and the Bandit fame would bust someone for .25 MPH over. Sure the fish was over the limit and illegal. Justice is done. Less than 1 % over, I think the DNR fellow was having a bad day. By the way, this is no reflection of my thought's on Canada or their people, in the states we have lot's of folks worse."

But, to use the speeding analogy if I got pulled over and got a ticket for going 57mph in a 55 but I thought I was going 54, it would be nice to know moving forward if my stuff was accurate compared to theirs. it seems pretty simple that you could measure the fish on their ruler and then have them measure it on yours.

Over the last 5 years Canadians have booked more than 2 million hotel nights in Las Vegas casinos. Our city is one of the foremost tourist destinations in the world. Last year we had 40M+ visitors.Now on a regular average Saturday night I can't drive down certain streets because of hundreds of 'J' walkers illegally crossing the street. In some cases it can take an hour to drive one mile down the strip because of walkers who can't follow a street walk/dont walk sign. I usually just build the extra travel time in, but it can be frustrating. I have NEVER seen a single ticket written for anyone not blatantly walking down the middle of the street. We don't want to hassle our guests over minor infections.What would happen to our tourist business if our police started writing tickets to people who left the curb one second after the light started flashing? I see this 1/8 inch ticket as a similar case.If you treated the officers with respect. If you weren't obviously abusing the law (a 26 in fish over). I just don't see writing a ticket for an obvious minor mistake. If you were rude or mistreated the officer in any way sure throw the book at you. To me it is bad business. Treating a tourist badly who is spending a lot of money to have fun is just bad business. That 1/8 inch fish could turn into 10s of thousands of dollars lost.Just my two cents.B-"

As the captain of my boat, anything that goes in my live well gets the final measurement by me. If I think it's to close to call it swims. If we get stopped and a fish is considered over, it's my fine as I have the last call. Been checked a handful of times with no problems with fines or from fishing partners. But still try to get as close as possible."

The officers explained their position and issued a ticket to my buddy who was driving the boat that day. As it was likely that one of the two boys in the boat measured the fish while it was not completely flat in the measuring tool, I told him that I'd share the cost of the ticket with him. Ticket was $185 which we paid on the spot with a credit card. Officers said they have never had a person pay at the time of a ticket being issued. We were all quite relieved to hear these tickets are viewed the same as a speeding ticket and will not prohibit us from coming up next year. We were in the wrong with regards to having a fish in the slot on our boat. I just want to ""warn"" everyone else to be careful when it comes to watching the size of the fish you keep. There is no margin for error on this issue."

We said we din't know, but were under the 18"".They said always measure every fish kept, then asked what we used to measure fish. We showed them the measuring scale, don't remember what brand it was. They said OK, then inspected our fish, and showed us how to measure while the mouth and tail were pushed together. We were legal, as we knew we were. The wardens were professional in their interface, and we learned to pay more attention to not guessing at length. As a result of the experience, using a magic marker, I marked off rough calibrations on the inside of my live well lid. This helps in getting a ballpark idea of length, and those close to size restriction can then be measured accurately on the commercial measuring stick. Bill"

The CO has never checked us but I don't want any problems. I took a group of five to fish there and I thought I was going to have to beat them over the head to listen to me.
