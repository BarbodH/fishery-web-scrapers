We took some advice from a WC member and spent Friday night at La Place Rendevous in Fort Frances. We had to wait a total of 10 minutes to cross the border as there were 2 cars ahead of us at 4PM in the afternoon. It took me about the same amount of time to go in and pay the duty on the extra beer and liquor that we brought with us. (FYI- we took 9 cases of beer and 3- 1.75L bottles of liquor and 2-1L bottles of liquor with us. We put 4 cases of beer in one vehicle so they would be legal and the rest went into my vehicle so only one of us would have to go in and pay the duty. They charged us duty on the beer and it came out to be $37.61 USD total.) La Place Rendevous worked out great for us. We had waterfront rooms which were somewhat dated but clean and functional. The best part was that everthing was right there for us. After driving 11 hours to get there,the last thing anybody wanted to do was drive to a restaurant/bar. The lounge is nice.We were in there pretty quick after we got settled into the rooms. They have outdoor seating by the lake and the food was pretty good. Service was awesome both for dinner and breakfast the next morning before we left. The blueberry pancakes are killer.We stopped at Rainy Lake Sports to pick up our crawlers. We pulled up and the place was packed with people headed north. I thought for sure we would be tied up there for quite some time but we were out of there in 15-20 minutes.Fishermans Cove is as good as I remember. We haven't been there since 2003. The cabin, boats ,motors and grounds are well maintained. Dan, Betty and their son Devon really take pride in their place and it shows.The fishing was pretty good for the most part. The week started off with Sat., Sun.,Mon. and Tues. in the mid to upper 80's with hardly any breeze until Tues. afternoon. We slayed them Tues evening before we went in just north of the green can at Poplar Narrows. The wind had picked up considerably from the southeast and we would motor up to about 20fow and drift with spinner rigs and would catch 2-3 fish on each drift. We fished mostly the west side of Big Island. We caught numerous fish in the mid 20's. Our biggest for the trip was a 27"" that my brother caught. He also had what he thinks was a 30""+ fish but lost it at the net. Wednesday brought strong west winds at 20-30 mph. Boat control was an issue and we got some decent rainstorms too. We still caught fish but seemed like we had to work harder for them.Thursday we decided to run to South Inlet to escape the wind. We found a spot that we pulled some nice fish from but not a lot of them. We caught 3 fish at 25""+ within an hour and several 21-22"" fish. After lunch we tried a few other spots but fishing was spotty as thunderstorms were moving in and we got pelted pretty bad on the way in.Friday we still had a pretty heavy west wind but decided to go fish the east side of Big Island. We caught a lot of fish but the largest was only 23'. The day turned out pretty nice. Had a nice shorelunch on a beach there but again the thunderstorms rolled in at about 4pm making for another miserable ride back to camp.All in all the fishing was pretty good considering the weather that we had to fight and the fact that we had three newbies with us. I think all but one guy caught at least a 24"" walleye on the trip. Our biggest pike was 36 1/2"" We also caught two smallies. My nephew caught a 17 1/2"" and I caught one around 14"".One bad thing did happen to us. On Wed. we came back closer to camp and fished around an island in the Bay of islands to get out of the wind. One of our boats which my brother-in-law and a friend were in (both 70 years old)decided to go in a little earlier than us. We weren't that far from camp and he assured me that he knew the way. It turns out that he got turned around in the wind and the rain and ended up heading to Rat Bay instead of Scout Bay. So when I got back to camp and seen that their boat wasn't there I knew we had to go back out to find them. My brother and I were just about to go back out when a very nice 21' Lund with a 300hp Merc pulls in and he overhears our conversation. At this point it's about5-5:30pm-windy and rainy. He asked what boat we were taking and we said a camp boat. Without hesitation he said hop in we'll go in mine. I showed him on his map where I thought they might have went and told him they would probably try to back track once they realized they went the wrong way. So by this time I find out their names are Mark and Bob and Mark says we'll take his route to Farewell Bay. It seemed like we were back out on the lake within 5mins and started heading that way and came around an island and spot Ed and Dave up against a very small island with the motor up. It turns out that Ed did try to back track and when he turned around he hit a reef at about half throttle disabling the motor. Without hesitation Mark manuvers his Lund to the lee side of the island and we tie it up to a tree. We walk around the island and walk Ed's boat around to the lee side of the island and secure it there for the camp to recover the next day. At this point we get back into Mark's pristine Lund with mud and whatever on our shoes and pretty much trash his boat. All I can say is I don't know if we would have found them with a camp boat that night given the weather conditions. So again thanks to Mark and Bob for helping out a couple of stranded fisherman on Lac Seul.Moral of the story is that I should have never let them go in by themselves in that kind of weather even though we were within a mile of Scout Bay.Given their ages and the weather it could have easily turned into a very bad situation if we didn't find them that evening. The next day we find out that the lower unit is completely trashed and the powerhead would have to be removed to get the broken piece of drive shaft out of the spline. Cost: $2800-OUCH!!Other than that we had a great time, caught a lot of fish, had a lot of laughs, drank some beer and came back with a couple of stories to tell.Can't wait for the next trip!"
4115153,pjshorthorn,2015-08-10 00:59:00,5654,Wow !!!! You fellas sure did have an adventure. Glad everyone ended up being safe and sound. It is very easy to get turned around on Lac Seul. It sounds like the weather was exactly the same for you as it was for us on Eagle lake that week. PjShorthorn
4116745,Aspencreek,2015-08-10 13:56:00,2911,Bstar....did you hit any of the spots I sent you?
4117129,Bstar,2015-08-10 15:49:00,564,Aspen...sent you a PM
4118761,tv4fish,2015-08-11 07:38:00,2694,"Bstar: I sure hope you thanked Mark and Bob profusely (I'm sure you did) Your situation could have ended a lot worse, just very glad that it didn't. If those two guys are members here - Good on'ya guys."
4118857,Bstar,2015-08-11 07:54:00,564,We definitely thanked them profusely. Ed went over to their cabin and thanked them personally and gave them a case of beer. Thanks again to Mark and Bob if you are on WC!
4119913,dan the fishing guy,2015-08-11 12:56:00,1,"If on this forum, I would like to extend a BIG thank you to our US friends (the boys from Brainard MN) from the LSFL houseboat parked on Taylor Island early week of August 3rd. Your gift of ketchup was much appreciated. Chase me down in TBay if I can return the good-will. A week of camping with the wife and no ketchup would be a hardship no man should bare. I hope those who discovered our forgotten tote bin of rum, wine and of course ketchup left at the landing at Deception Bay landing Aug 3, I hope we left you a smile and you toasted my forgetfulness and our misfortune. . As to a fishing report, the first 4 days of east wind and rain everyday made for tough fishing. Weather broke and winds shifted from NW and fishing exploded. Double headers were the norm for the two of us. Nothing big (20"") but non-stop action."
4120033,tv4fish,2015-08-11 13:09:00,2694,Darn it Dan -- You really set yourself up for a bad week.
4120233,Guest,2015-08-11 14:03:00,0,"""You really set yourself up for a bad week"", .... thanks tv4fish .... no choice, the wife had to come. (lol) Yup, so brave I am when the wife doesn't read this forum. The way I looked at it was a hard week fishing will always be better than a good week in the office. Much like Bstar's appreciation, good will & help extended on (any) lake is very much appreciated and respected. Hope to pay it fwd."
