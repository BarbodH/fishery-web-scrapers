Yes' could go in strictly fishing, I guess, but I do more jig fishing in Canada, so here goes: We're pretty stictly jig fishermen in Canada, and I sometimes note a HUGE amount of line twist, either in mono or in braid. I know how to get rid of most of it, but the real question is this: Do short shanked hooks cause more twist than standard hooks? My dad fished a long shnked hook jig all day long, until I finally ran out of them, and we switched him to shot shanks, and within a short period of time, it seemed like he was getting a lot of twist. We untwisted, changed color and style to a long shanked jig again, and seemed like he was fine the rest of the day. What say you? With the jigging motion, does shank length cause or reduce line twist? Observations? Also, BTW, we fish mostly minnows, but some plastic or crawlers mixed in."
4120313,Bill Krejca,2015-08-11 14:28:00,6107,"It could be that the increased resistance of the longer hook impedes the spinning of the bait more than a shorter one, never thought of it that way before. It could maybe increase the spin, though, if the jig is allowed to drop quickly. My guess is that it maybe depends more on what is attached to the hook - some ""stuff"" just spins more than other ""stuff"". I have gone almost completely to a several foot leader with a swivel at the top end for jigs - this reduces twist considerably, I think, however, I still get some. Bill"
4120337,1jigfish2,2015-08-11 14:36:00,110,"We jig all day up there, using long shanked hooks all of the time. We do not have a problem with line twist, but we always use a swivel about 2 feet up the line, from the hook. Not sure if you use one, but they work."
4120393,Algoma Guy,2015-08-11 15:10:00,48,Yes a barrel swivel 2ft above your jig and your problems are eliminated!! Use 15lb or 20lb fluorocarbon for lead line to avoid pike bite offs. I ALWAYS do this for guests as well as myself.
4120601,Thumpr50,2015-08-11 17:20:00,139,I too have gone the route of a swivel and flouro leader have no issues with line twist and makes re-tying a new jig easier.
4120617,Habitual Eyer,2015-08-11 17:27:00,144,"we have had issues when fishing bigger baits (sucker minnows, big Dace') on jigs. Most always related to less then perfect alignment when putting jig hook through minnow. If off center even a little, the jig /minnow may twirl on way down. Also spin when jigging (lifting and dropping). This puts the twist in the line I think. Have also encountered it using standard fat heads. If your off center even a little...jig will twirl while fishing. I think this to be the case...can't find any other way line would get that much twist."
4122545,Mike Kansas,2015-08-12 12:40:00,1463,"Yes, the swivel is the answer. I don't believe it reduces the feel for the bite especially if you focus on not having slack in your line and always staying ""In Touch"" with that jig. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
