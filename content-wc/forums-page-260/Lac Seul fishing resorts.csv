Rod, Lorita and all the other help are very friendly and accomodating. I have been going to Lac Seul Lodge for over fifteen years and I have yet to hear any guest complain about the accomodations, boats, equipment, or staff in that time. I can't speak to White Wing, as I have never stayed there but I can tell you that I would be very surprised if did not enjoy a stay at Lac Seul Lodge. Steve Ediger"
4109017,dan lollar,2015-08-07 07:03:00,10,"Yes, that was me at your cabin. Once again, thanks for letting her take me through. I have pretty much decided to go to Lac Suel Camp next year. I don't expect people to hold my hand, but some help for a first time visitor is appreciated. We stopped back by on Saturday and the family like the camp and the owners took more of their time to show my wife some cabins. There is a reason these camps are full."
4109681,maddogg,2015-08-07 10:17:00,178,I've noticed most camps offer 50 or 60 hp outboards with a 30 gal. limit on gas. I was wondering how much gas is needed for 6 days of fishing.I realize it depends on how far you go.On the average is it enough to last the week or should I expect to purchase more?
4109785,Steve Ediger,2015-08-07 11:03:00,97,"Yea, I thought I saw you with your family. If there is anything I can do to help you out, let me know. Hope to see you up north. Steve"
4111762,dan lollar,2015-08-08 10:04:00,10,"Maddog The camp we were at had 40 and 60 HP motors. We opted for the 40. The motor had plenty of power and zipped around quite nicely at a very good speed. We had a 20 gallon of gas allowance and used probably 12-15 gallons. We also had a 20 dozen minnow limit but did not use them all. They were generous on the minnow count in your bucket. 4 dozen was probably close to 100. We did not make long runs since I didn't know the area well and the weather did not cooperate. There are areas withing a mile you can catch walleye. If from the camp we stayed at you went to Steamboat Narrows every day, you would go over your allotment of gas. It is easy to get 4-6 miles from camp. just tooling around."
4111778,dan lollar,2015-08-08 10:10:00,10,"Steve Is there a time you think is the best time to go up? I normally like to go up the July 4th weekend, but time constraints did not allow it this year. Late May and early June seems to be dicey on the weather and August tends to be hot. Most lodge owners will say anytime the have an empty cabin is a great time to come up. The fishing was off when we were there with the odd weather. When do you think the best time period is. Wouldn't mind being up when your group is, I enjoy meeting new folks who know how to have an enjoyable time."
4116257,Steve Ediger,2015-08-10 11:36:00,97,"Dan, I usually go up 2 weeks in the middle of June with my family, one week at the end of July with the guys, and one week at the end of September with a few guys. I like the June trip because I enjoy being away with my family AND the smallmouth are usually on their beds and are easy to catch. I really enjoy the smallmouth since we don't have many here in Kansas where I live. I like the end of July trip because I enjoy hanging out with the guys and fishing the main lake humps and structure for big walleye. The weather can be hot that time of year (which I get plenty of in Kansas) so that is a drawback but it is usually nice and enjoyable. I like the end of September because the leaves are turning and it is beautiful. The mornings are cool and crisp and the afternoons are usually perfect in my books, highs in the low 60's. The fish are very aggressive that time of year getting ready for winter and you have the lake pretty much to yourself and a few moose hunters. The days are quite short which leaves plenty of time for a cocktail in the evening and a leisurely breakfast in the morning. So, I guess I like it whenever I am up there, but for different reasons. September may be my favorite because of the weather and trees. Pick a time, I know you will enjoy it. Steve"

528820,rebelrn2001,2003-05-07 22:03:00,1563,I am joining my cousins this year for my first trip to LS. Last year Jeff told me they caught over 1100 walleyes in 6 days for 6 guys. Resort is: http://www.fishermanscoveontario.com/. I am not familiar w/the lake but all I know is I am looking forward to learning it a bit. We are going up on June 14. I am also going with the wife to Wabigoon for our annual trip on 5/31. Darn...I will be in Canada 2 out of 3 weeks in June. Can any one match that????
528821,Tom,2003-05-08 08:15:00,1063,"At this stage of the game, being so late, I would try the Trip Finder at http://www.justfishontario.com/trip_finder.htm it is about the best chance you have of getting a slot. Good luck."

528822,Guest,2003-05-09 05:14:00,0,"I have fished Lac Seul since 1980. I stayed at Scout lake camp for a few years, but now I stay at Onaway Lodge, which is far superior to S.L.C.Onaway has excellent boat packages at a resonable price. The resort owners are very nice people who are very accomodating. I would not keep going back year after year if they were not.Good Luck!Onaway Lodge 1-888-662-9291http://www.worldwidefishing.com/ontario/b735"
528823,Guest,2003-05-09 12:45:00,0,Send me your email addr as I may have to cancel a June Lac Suel tripand maybe we can arrange to take our booking.
4102017,dan lollar,2015-08-04 13:33:00,10,"Having just come back from Canada at White Wing Lodge this week, I just wanted to let people know our experience. First, the good. The cabins and boats are great. The cabins are modern and clean. The had satellite TV, which we did not use, since we brought DVD's. The web site said that the cabins had DVD players, but ours didn't, when we asked, we got one, but not with enough cables to watch television and movies.The help: Holly was VERY attentive to the cabins and kept the boat supplies up to the minute. No complaints about her or the equipment. Thomas, who was a pilot and sort of grounds man was helpful also. Secondly, the bad. Dave, the lodge owner, was mostly not involved and worked around the camp. His help finding fish was to say to fish around the islands and green buoy marker, and some guys had some luck at Steamboat Narrows. Also got a not too accurate map of the area. Basically, no help what-so-ever in putting you on fish. He seemed very distant and not caring about if you got fish. One would think, when spending $2400.00 for the camp, plus travel expenses and coming 1150 miles, the camp owner would be a bit more involved. We go to Canada for one thing, to fish. Some returning guests were kind enough to point out some places to fish. The part of the lake we were on was about 100 square miles, not counting the area past Steamboat Pass, a lot of open, big water. This could be why his camp was only one third full, when two camps down the road were booked solid, with a waiting list for next year, which is what I am going to do. I know this is a generalization and don't wish to offend anyone, but we stopped at least 8 other camps, and quite bluntly, the ones run and owned by the Americans were the busiest, treated us very well and had the nicest people. The guests there had nothing but praise for the camp and the owners. The Canadian owned camps were unfriendly and not helpful to me planning a trip for next year. It's is the little things that count, like a smile and how to find fish. As much as I like the camp and help, I will not be coming back here."
528805,BWLCwalleyeguy,2003-03-18 12:37:00,26,"Alright guys, I need everyones opinions on lodges on Lac Seul. I am looking for a lodge that isnt too costly and is located on a part of the lake that is close to good fishing. The lodge doesnt have to be fancy, I just need a place to cook, shower, and sleep after a long day in the boat. Any suggestions would be very helpful. I am looking at going up in late June. Thanks guys."
528806,Guest,2003-03-18 13:40:00,0,"some cabins are alittle older but is close to great fishing it aslo has great service fairly cheap and not far from ear falls.. here is there site not much on it but anyway http://www.nwconx.net/~goldpine/ ,thats gold pines camp Im going back there for the season opener"
528807,Guest,2003-03-18 14:01:00,0,There are some great Lac Seul lodges listed on http://www.justfishontario.com/lac_seul.htmI found this site and also filled out their Trip Finder http://www.justfishontario.com/trip_finder.htmand got just the trip I was looking for. I don't want to push any lodge but it was one of those on the site. Good luck and hope this helps.
528808,Guest,2003-03-25 10:53:00,0,"There are a lot of camps on Lac Seul that will fit the needs of what you are looking for, but if you think that you will find a June date open you will probably be disappointed.Most camps on LS book full for the month of June very early,you may get lucky if someone has a cancellation.Get on the phone and start calling.Good luck."

528810,NateW,2003-03-28 20:41:00,96,"We've always enjoiyed staying at Lac Seul's Scout Lake Resort...try www.fishlacseul.comWe'll be there July 12 - 19, this will be our fourth trip. Fishing is great, rates are moderate."
528811,Guest,2003-03-30 12:27:00,0,I have stayed at Goose Bay Camp and it sounds like what you are looking for. I am going back again and was very satisfied. I have also heard good things about Evergreen Resort. Both are in the Ear Falls area. June is very busy so I would call asap. Maybe you will get lucky with a cancellation or something. I hope this helps.
528812,Guest,2003-04-01 12:23:00,0,"Anyone know anything about Lost Island Lodge. Last year we stayed at Mahkwa Lodge and the fishing was great but the cabins were so-so at best.Your opinions are appreciated,Chuck"
528813,david,2003-04-01 18:27:00,0,"Hey if ur camp was around the ear falls area. I would suggest going to White Wing Resort. The cabins are awesome, and the prices are below average, no docking fees. The resort has an awesome restraunt and bar. This also has some games for the kids and a big screen. The docks are great. I would reccomend this before all the other lodges. Dave"
