4123201,scar,2015-08-12 17:31:00,196,See if Colin Gosse aka Lac Seul Guide or Ben Beatie are available. They guide out of Moose Horn Lodge but do private if not booked. They will put you on big fish day one and you can keep returning to spots all week. We hired Colin last year and it was the best fishing we ever had. Went back to those spots a few times that week and pounded them. No one was available this year when we were up last week so we were on our own and caught lots of fish but on the small side. fished out of Hudson one day and out of deception bay up to Bear narrows the 2nd.

We have fished the area several times and my parents and nephew are finishing up a week up there right now. we will be headed back in a couple weeks her so I thought I would put some of their information with a couple other reports. Try and narrow down the search a bit."
