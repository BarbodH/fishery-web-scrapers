It is a good news....bad news balance, with a lot of work to keep everything running smoothly. I bet those youngsters would rather be in camp instead of starting school. PjShorthorn"
4118961,Bakefish,2015-08-11 08:27:00,1077,"I read on here how the lodge owners get excited at the beginning of each spring, looking forward to the upcoming season. Just wondering, do you look toward the end of the season with the same anticipation? I know you guys work your butts off from week to week in the unending cycle, but I would guess that you are certainly looking forward to some respite. What say you?"
4119105,v-bay gord,2015-08-11 08:55:00,3168,"I think most lodge owners are like crack junkies.....they live for their next fix of overstimulation. While I look forward to the Fall and a slower pace, I often find I miss the action from previous busy months. Then there's always the Fall projects and maintenance issues to look forward to. Here's what I'm planning for this winter (perhaps PJ and Breezy would like to come back and go for a ""ride""?) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAMA...ature=youtu.be"

Leave it up to you crackheads to figure that stuff out during your downtime. I do think it would be appropriate to have some broomstick ponies available for the carousel ride. PjShorthorn"
4119337,Larbo,2015-08-11 10:01:00,231,Carousel trolling is the new big thing? Hmmm... I guess I will start carving my wooden horse to accept a hummingbird depth finder...
4119401,pjshorthorn,2015-08-11 10:20:00,5654,Will the horse include downside imaging ? PjShorthorn
4119529,tv4fish,2015-08-11 11:07:00,2694,I have ONE thing (Ok - 2 things) to say about this: 1) SOMEBODY has waaaay too much time on their hands and 2) That's pretty darn cool!!!!!!!!
4119665,BreezyPoint,2015-08-11 11:54:00,1581,"I'm up for a ride, but I am concerned they may attempt to throw us in as punishment for our bad behavior this summer.Frank"
4119729,wallydave,2015-08-11 12:08:00,2151,What are the Canadian statute of limitations for a case like this? Depending on the limitations you may want to pass on this!
4119905,fishpoop,2015-08-11 12:55:00,630,That's one of the craziest things I think I've ever seen. lol
4121969,Obabikon,2015-08-12 08:57:00,2370,"My wife and kids left a few days ago. So, being up here without them for a couple months... the camp just isn't quite as much fun. I still love it, but there's something about having your two little kids laughing and giggling that makes it even better. I know I'll miss it when I leave, but I'll be so excited to see them, it won't phase me one bit. This summer has been the busiest summer I've experienced in 9 years, and I'm pretty exhausted. Looking forward to a slower September to do some work."
