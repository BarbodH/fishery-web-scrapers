There are also opportunities for crappie and perch if you are interested. We taken our own boats and used camp boats, either option is fine. The only issue is that there is an hour boat ride from Totem to the lodge and it could be rough when they take you across the open water. Been there and done that.... it can be a really beautiful ride or a very lump one. I however, have not been there in September. I'm told that the fall fishing there for musky is tremendous. I've only been there in June and July. My experience is that there is great musky fishing close to the camp, I've caught several mid 40's fish, but have a friend who caught a 52 and another that has a 50. The camp is very nice, the food is good as well. Are you taking your own boat or using a camp boat? DJ the camp manager is a great people person and will be glad to point you in the right direction. There are some good musky guides at the lodge and the chef is an avid musky fisherman. Shoot me a PM if you have more questions. Jim"
