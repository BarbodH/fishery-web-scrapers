Just so much unspoiled wilderness & things they never get to see in our 9-5 workday world...........it was a real eye opener for them, we've been back home just a week & they already want to know when we're going back.Not all is lost with the I-phone generation just yet !Fish"
4114401,Ogoki,2015-08-09 15:32:00,291,"The second above post is right on. If I was in my 30's or 40's with a young family , house payment etc, I would not leave the family at home and spend $1500 to $2000 and go on a fishing trip with the guys. My first fly in trip I was 16 . It got in my blood and I desperatly wanted to go again. I spent the next 14 years working a full time job ( aversged 58 hours a week ) and truck farmed 5 acres . Bought 6 acres , built my barn and built my house with the free labor from my Dad . I didn't hire a cintractor to build it . Once I got it built and was living alone in a new brick home , only then did I go on another fly in. Yes 14 years later. Met my wife and we took our honeymoon on a fly in trip. She had been on 30 fly ins as of this past July . I recently had vericose vein surgery on both legs , knee surgery and low back disc issues. Not many people now days have the grit to work that hard to get ahead. I can still out work most anybody I know . I may have went a little overboard working that hard . My Mom had always worked hard until the past few years . She is 96 and doing more than most people in their 70's . ."
4114441,Catch 22,2015-08-09 15:45:00,417,"It is really a matter of the evolving family life, the job market and expectations that people have for fishing. Tons of studies on demographics by business/ tourism groups have the numbers.Families have more 'going on"" now. It complicates schedules....not like the ""Happy Days"" /""Dirty Dancing"" era. Do you remember the owner of the Adirondack camp lamenting that he didn't understand what was happening to his returning customer count each year????? Schools now let out the 2nd week of June and start the 1st or 2nd week of August. Summer programs and athletics shorten that even more. Private camps for music, sports, religion, dance etc, cut in also.A few decades ago, household income was mainly from the male. The housewife was available to vacation any time the male got his scheduled vacation time from the ""shop"". Vacation was set in stone and planned to give ""pop"" his break for the year. Now, with pop working a couple of jobs and mom working also, vacation schedules are not easy. Often a long weekend is the best they can put together.If you want a vacation with out care for what mother nature can toss at your family, you book into the ""waterpark"" accommodation so the kids can play and have 4G poolside while mom shops and pop plays a couple of rounds of golf or visits the sports bar. I live in the WI northwoods and know for a fact that the Dells and other waterpark destination stays have ""short stopped"" a huge amount of traffic from Illinois and Southern Wisconsin.The further decline of ""the faithful"" comes as those of us that grew up outdoors simply get older. Most of the guys my age are done fishing for various reasons.....I have downsized my rig to be able to enjoy solo fishing now.OH....and now the rest of the story.....fishing for me often does not have to include catching to be enjoyable. For too many, if they do not catch or fill the freezer,....they lose interest in going again.....the numbers decline..........inevitable eh???"
4116465,Sportfisher,2015-08-10 12:27:00,47,"For those of you that hunt, next time you go out, see how many 20 somethings are in the field. Our group started in their 20's and now 40 years later the same group goes, along with kids and grandkids. But that is an exception me thinks. Sportfisher"
4116817,LoDo,2015-08-10 14:15:00,721,"In reading these posts, the common theme seems to be PTO and money with a side order of ""lack of interest"". Lack of interest is an excuse for those that don't get to Canada or lakes in MN and WI that produce. The issue with getting to Canada or lakes that produce is money and time off. This all goes hand in hand. The game of golf is in trouble too. Super expensive, 5-6hr rounds and the interest level is only there if you started at a young age and are somewhat competitive. I can't imagine there are many folks in there 30s, 40s, etc... that go to Canada for the first time. Id bet that most folks go to Canada in their youth and hopefully get hooked and continue the tradition in their later years."
4117921,WowMarie,2015-08-10 20:33:00,19,"On the other hand, I go to Canada every year with a group of women...youngest is 52...the rest of us are over 60. Our husbands think we are nuts, but they know how much we love our trip. Hauling the boat...staying on an island (resort...must have a few amenities). Walleye and Muskie fishing...eating Shore Lunch...it just doesn't get any better. My 2 daughters are not interested in fishing (or golf which I used to play a lot until back surgery) but I have 3 grandsons...their father hunts but Grandma hopes to instill my love of fishing in their hearts...I think the 3 year old is catching on...you know the old saying ""Take a kid fishing"""
4117993,Nimstug,2015-08-10 21:02:00,2605,"I really didn't start fishing until I was in my 40's. I did some as a 10-12 year old as my grandfather had a cottage near a lake in Wisconsin by Lake Geneva. That was for a couple weeks or so a year and certainly was not something that I was raised with. Back then it was basball, football, hockey, and even some basketball that kept me occupied."
4118537,kzoofisher,2015-08-11 06:19:00,5144,"The lowest price trips are pretty close to a weeks gross pay for a median income family. A lot if young people aren't at the median yet so it's a big investment. Add in the long drive and not everyone is that into fishing and you have a problem. I'm going with my younger son, the older likes fishing but not enough for 20 hours of driving. We just got back from a family trip to Gettysburg and I'm lucky enough to be able to afford both, if I couldn't there would have been a decision to be made. The future economy will be the driver of camps surviving and if wages don't start to increase I don't see much hope for a lot of places. Somebody like me will go as long as there are some camps and I haven't gone bust."
4118969,HeHooksHimself,2015-08-11 08:28:00,725,"I started going fishing ""up north"" in the late 90s with trips three years in a row to Minnesota. My first trip to Canada was in 2000. I was 48. My fishing and partner and I talked about going to Canada since we were in our early 20s but couldnt seem to pull it off until our kids were grown and on their own. I have taken both of my grown sons to Canada and my youngest enjoyed it but did not get bit by the Canada bug. My older one did and now is committed to going every year while his dad is still kicking. My youngest one is somewhat interested, but is living life hand to mouth like many 30 somethings. My son-in-law also has gone a few times and really loves it, but is finding it harder as his kids grow and become more active. I think there are many passionate young people out there that would love to go to Canada once or twice a year but just have to balance life and can't afford it. As for me, I am going twice a year as long as it is possible and the Lord chooses to give me breath. As I tell my lovely bride of 42 years, ""Well, the budget starts with Canada. Then comes the mortgage and other bills..."" Fish On! Hooks"
4119393,Old Timer,2015-08-11 10:15:00,255,"I have a friend whose business depended heavily on the Ontario fishing business. He hired a big marketing company to explore the future of Ontario's fishing industry. He learned the following:1. There is very little recruitment to the fishing business. Mostly, tourist camps are trading the same folks back and forth, with few new folks entering the market.2. The average age for customers is getting higher every year.3. The cost of fishing is becoming too expensive for most families. By way of comparison, the cost of a turnkey Florida vacation is cheaper than most do-it-yourself outpost camps.4. If Gramps or Dad quits paying for the fishing trip, the younger generation quits going. They may like fishing, but not well enough to pay their own way.There may have been a few other items he learned, but I can't remember them here. By the way, he sold his business. This was ten years ago. I know, as I handled the sale."
4119617,Pikeslayer8,2015-08-11 11:41:00,1460,"Used to be that Ft Francis was just filled with fishermen much more so than present. Groups of fishermen everywhere! Didn't matter if you're at the salad bar of a restaurant, aisle of grocery store or at the gas pumps....inevitable someone mutters ""comin or goin"" and then you give the nod It is customary to then recieve the nod back often accomanied by a tip of cap. Often times information is exchanged such as ""Chartruse is on fire"" or ""rained only once on us"". Miss those days"
4118985,Bakefish,2015-08-11 08:33:00,1077,"I've been going to Canada on a regular basis since the early 70's. I've seen a lot of kids come and go over the years. One thing I've noticed is that when a young man comes into his own he tends to take a hiatus from the trips to Canada. I think it has something to do with that stuff that doesn't wash off to easily, if you know what I mean. But once he gets married he tends to make a reappearance."
4113250,fishron,2015-08-09 06:04:00,317,"Having fished many years in the U.S., Canada, even Costa Rica, I've noticed that the vast majority of fisherman are what's known as the baby-boomers or older. The same seems to be happening to the sport of golf. I started fishing Canada and the Jersey shore as soon as I got my first vehicle. We've had large groups including our children on trips through the years but what I don't see is the enthusiasm for fishing that I had in my younger years. Maybe it has to do the fact that often both husband and wife have to work to make ends meet these days. Maybe the pressure we see on the freshwater fishing stocks today will self correct in the coming years. Unfortunately, the same will not be true for the oceans which are being depleted by commercial fishing. What do you think?"
4113266,Obabikon,2015-08-09 06:31:00,2370,"Golf and fishing have always been that way. There are young people who do them, but the vast majority are people who are retired. You have to have money and time for both of those hobbies, and young people don't have much of either. While I agree that fishing (overall) might be down a little bit, I feel perfectly comfortable that we have enough youth interested to continue the sport. It has more to do with people in their 30's and 40's are too busy raising families and working."

All of us are from the midwest and currently live in downtown Denver, CO. This is year 25 ish for me. I can't remember a day growing up in Minnesota, ND, Wisconsin and Iowa not going to Canada every summer w/ my father. However on the flip side we never did Disney Land and beach type trips with our family during my youth. Knowing what I know today, i'm so thankful we stuck to the lakes rather than the beaches. The boys I fish with that are 35 ish are all from the midwest and did the same with their fathers. My family will continue the tradition of Canadian adventures, camps, fishing poles, etc...."

4113841,retire55,2015-08-09 12:11:00,1029,"I concur that the majority of fishermen I see tend to be 45 years of age and older. And within that group, the biggest portion is fishermen over 55 years of age. As to why, I suggest it has a lot to do with whether or not a person develops a passion for fishing. In the late 40s, when I was 8 years old and my brother was 7 years old, our father brought us both along on his occasional day fishing trips to Lake St. Clair, the Detroit River or the western basin of Lake Erie. During the second summer after our fishing education commenced, my brother started to decline any invitation to accompany us fishing. While I cherished every opportunity to get out on the water, my brother did not. My brother hasn't fished since then while I on the other hand have enjoyed every chance I got to go fishing during the intervening years (64 of them). Parents play a large role in the development of a passion for fishing and I don't mean forcing kids to fish. Rather I think of the many Mike Borger videos many of us have been fortunate enough to watch. From my perspective, Mike's son Brendan has already developed a healthy passion for fishing. Occasionally, I get out with my two grandsons, 8 and 6, to spend maybe 15 minutes pan fishing. By then their attention span starts to wane. Will they ever develop a passion for fishing  I don't know. All I can do is provide love and access to the sport. I suspect that the majority of youth today have developed and/or are developing passions for a myriad of interests. There's so much information that is so readily available."
4114169,Ogoki,2015-08-09 14:04:00,291,"At one point in the '90s there were over 30 guys from our church who did fly in trips , some twice a summer. I can remember 8 of their sons gping at various times . NONE of the sons go now . Just a VERY few of the older guys now go. Age and health along with many deceased. Two of my freinds sons are going with us to Quetico on a canoe / fishing trip. These guys are really not passonate like their Dads . Mainly going to be with the group and of course there Dads . At the ranger station last September at Quetico , I asked the ranger if there was many younger people doing these trips. She said the vast majority are from 55 to 75 years old. I don't doubt there are young guys like the one above, that are passonate about doing trips to northwestern Ontario. But as a whole i don't see that may younger guys going . I even asked that question to Don Elliot from Mattice and he quickly agreed that there was not many young guys showing up at his dock to fly in. I personally would not like to be an outfitter relying on the large amount of younger people wanting to do these trips. I really hate to see that. I am presently packing g for a bear hunt / fishing trip. Driving the 1150 miles solo. I even told a couple guys they could go along and help drive and just fish. Trying to spark some interest . My September trip will be with 6 other people canoeing , camping and a little fishing . These guys are more into canoeing than fishing ."
4114289,bthomas3333,2015-08-09 14:49:00,465,"I think the biggest issue is the 'selfish' nature of doing these guys only trips. Younger guys have a hard time leaving the kids with the wife for a week. Then burning several thousand dollars and 1 of 2 or 3 weeks of vacation to leave the family at home alone.The only way to pull in the younger people is to appeal to 'family' trips where everyone can come and enjoy. The issue there is many younger women feel a vacation should be more family oriented place. No cooking for the family. Someone else cleaning up. Little danger of kids around water. I know there are camps like this, but bring a family of 4 to somewhere can run into Disney/Hawaii prices...which is a tough sell.Personally I did Canada guy only trips thru my 30s but I am thinking back to the 'objections' I heard about going. If the family issue isn't solved I don't think we will have too many camps left in 20 more years.I hope I am wrong. I know we all love going.B-"
