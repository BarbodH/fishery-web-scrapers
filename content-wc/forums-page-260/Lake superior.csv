4092665,justin99,2015-07-31 15:07:00,126,I travel up to lake superior provincial park typically every may/june targeting rainbows and lake trout. This year however we are going up the last week of August. We launch the boat at Sinclair Cove and camp near gargantua harbor meanwhile fishing anywhere within 20 miles either direction.My question is should we expect to catch any king salmon while trolling? Any chance they may be running the rivers? Coho salmon? anybody have some experience on superior that time of year?
