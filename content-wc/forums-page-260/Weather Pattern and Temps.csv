Are you highs in the 80s, low in the 60s with little rain or perhaps highs in the 60s, low in the 50s type of fisherman? Is there a certain outside temp where you feel fish are more active."
4116369,Guest,2015-08-10 12:05:00,0,stable weather is my preference any time of the year. Good Luck!

4117617,retire55,2015-08-10 18:49:00,1029,"Anytime we can get a south wind blowing at 15-20 mph for 4 or 5 days, catching is going to be very active."
4117721,LoDo,2015-08-10 19:20:00,721,"Leave this Thurs for NW Ontario. We are on the water 6 1/2 days. The weather temps look fairly stable, with highs in the upper 60s and lows in the lower 50s. Two of the 6 1/2 days calls for 50% chance of rain or better. Theres always a ton of beer on this trip! I promise we don't struggle in that dept. I've been doing this trip a lot of years, and like most, a few weeks before our travels we all get dialed into checking weather forecasts daily."
