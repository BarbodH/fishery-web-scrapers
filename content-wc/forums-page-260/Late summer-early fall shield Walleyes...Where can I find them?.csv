4119209,82zman,2015-08-11 09:22:00,1,I had to move my August trip fly in to Crooked Lake ( about 100 miles NW of Red Lake) with Showalters to the second week of September. I have fished these type of lakes with success in spring and summer but have never fished them late summer/early fall. Advice on paterns is appreciated especially from those who have fished these type of lakes during this time frame. Just wondering what to expect in general.

I like trolling large deep diving cranks, find em and jig if you prefer. Bring 1/2 - 3/4 oz jigs. Off rock points and mid water humps is a good place to start. If you BB then bring 3 oz."

That is where I would start....if no luck then start looking deeper.
