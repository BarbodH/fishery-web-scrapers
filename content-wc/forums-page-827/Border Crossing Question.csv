537687,fishinnut,2004-02-24 15:55:00,642,I plan on fishing Rainy Lake this summer and staying on the Canadian side. If I want to fish Minnesota waters must I stop at customs before and after I cross the border. This would be by boat. Would a Remote Border Crossing Permit allow unlimited crosssings without stopping at a Customs office? I will be near Fort Frances/International Falls area. Thanks

If you buy your minnows in Canada, (you can't take them back across the border if you are putting your boat in on the U.S. side and also keep your bait receipt for proof of purchase in Canada) you can fish with live bait in Canada. If you are putting in on the U.S. side, you have to fish with dead minnows or crawlers in bedding. Last year I was on Rainy for the Canadian opener and my buddy and I got checked be the border patrol out on the water, so don't mess around and do it leagle with the RBCP."
