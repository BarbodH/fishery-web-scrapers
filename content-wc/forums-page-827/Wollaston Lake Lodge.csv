537570,Guest,2004-02-19 13:33:00,0,"Depending on ice out the Pike should be moving out of the shallow bays and into the cabbage. Crankbaits should be the ticket this time of year. Don't forget your fly rod! This is a first-class lodge with world-class Pike fishing. The Cochrane river should still be holding Walleye this time of year. Best tip yet: Ask for Kenny as a guide! Have fun, I'm jealous."

First of all the place is awesome: fishing, lodge, cabins, food, service, guides, fishing, etc. etc. Except for a few lightning storms that we had to get out of the boats for, the weather was great. Bring rain gear and warm weather clothes with layers to add if it gets cold, also polarized sun glasses are nice. I would rate the place a 9 out of 10. These things below I would do different next time and they would make it a 10 out 10. I Rented gear from the lodge, it was ok, but very heavy weight average gear and a very limited tackle box. Next time I'll bring my own stuff. I spent one day on the trout cruiser. It was fun, but did just as well (size) or better (numbers) in about an hour trolling for trout with our regular guide in our regular boat at the end of day one. Unless you want a chance to catch a monster laker (and maybe not get a big one) save the day and go for the pike. Also, took a day and went to Cochrane fly in for grayling. It was fun to catch the grayling and get the grand slam, once, but I wouldn't do it again with a group of 6 +3 guides. There wasn't that much room nor time it seemed. The walk/hike to get to the grayling was also arduous, I'm surprised nobody broke an ankle or leg. Bottom line is I cut my trophy pike time in half with these two jaunts - must have been peer pressure. The lake is huge, expect to spend 30-60 minutes each way to get to where the guides want to take you, more if the lake is rough. Add the optional shore lunch (which is awesome) and maybe 3+ hours of your 8 hour fishing day is not spent fishing. Next time I would try to maximize the time I had my line in the water. The guides are with you for 8 hour days (I think) and you get back to the lodge pretty early, unless you pay for overtime. One night (it stays light pretty late) we took out the smaller boats available at the lodge up the cut by the lodge to catch a walleye to complete our slam. In less than 15 minutes 4 of us had walleyes (5 minutes from the lodge) on simple jigs and crawlers. I would spend more time 'after hours' next time fishing that area for walleye without our guides, and maybe try some other closer areas for pike too. One of the guys with us caught a 27"" walleye in there. We used medium/large mepps spinners almost exclusively, the single trebles are a lot easier on the guides. Next time I'd try more rapala and crankbaits. The biggest fish in our group was 43.5"" caught on the last day. I caught two 41""s on the last day too. Our group caught several pike in the 35-40"" inch range and many lunchers. If I had used all four days for pike fishing, I have no doubt I would have landed more, bigger fish. Good luck! I'm jealous, but I am going to try Wiley Point Wilderness Lodge on LOTW this year."

537875,pike nut,2004-03-02 06:10:00,23,First class operation. If I could afford it I would go. The fishing is great for trophy pike but the service and accomdations are what seperates it from the rest. there are two other lodges on the lake that are less expensive but Wollaston lake lodge has all of the extras. If that's what you want go for it. Good luck.
