If fishing is slow on Dogtooth itself, don't be afraid to run into Kilvert. Sometimes things seem to go better up there. Hope for some wind and cloudy conditions. Usually not a big numbers game but you should find some big fish. As for trout, find the deepest water and either vertical jig over marked fish, or troll if your set up for that."
