537748,Guest,2004-02-27 00:37:00,0,i dont really know. All I know is that the fishing below the dam is dam good. We put the fish in the live well and when we had all the limits pulled it out at the launch ramp and there were no dnr people there. we went back to camp and cleaned the fish up and that was it. thats a good question though. i guess they have to take your word for it. i forget but I suppose there must be be some limits. They can see on your license where you bought your license and stayed for the week so it not be unresonable to think that well maybe they did catch these fish below the dam. If we ever go back with our own boat we will make it a point to fish below the dam. It was really great and we used leaches on some really tiny hooks. I would not have believed it if I did not see it first hand.

537660,mp3553,2004-02-23 11:26:00,7,I'll try and leave you all 1 fish to catch!! Can't wait to get back... 16 weeks to go
537662,Guest,2004-02-23 12:55:00,0,How will the DNR know if the fish in or above the slot came from below the dam or out of the lake?
537663,Guest,2004-02-23 14:38:00,0,Do the fish below the Dam have to killed like the ones on the Lake?
537664,Guest,2004-02-23 15:01:00,0,I will be staying at fisherman's Cove north of ear falls I believe. I will see you on the water! Just look for the Rangers.
537666,Guest,2004-02-23 17:39:00,0,"MP3553, Is there a good place in Fort Francis to buy bulk leeches? I bring my own worms but would like to bring some leeches to camp. I was even thinking about bringing up a minnow trap, does anyone know if trapping your own minnows is legal? If you are still at Goosebay Saturday afternoon or Sunday I'd like to buy you a beer and pick your brain about the fish bite while you were up there."
537678,mp3553,2004-02-24 11:07:00,7,"Sorry, can't help you on the leach thing. We cross @ Pembina in ND. Which Sat/Sun are you referring to 19/20th or 26/27th?"
537680,mp3553,2004-02-24 11:12:00,7,Checked past post... We are supposed to leave Sat 7/3. If work gives us Mon as a holiday>will try to stay Sat/Sun to fish if Andrea has space avalible. Hmmmm... lets see... That would be 16 days fishing!!!
537682,mp3553,2004-02-24 11:15:00,7,The walleye below the dam have red eyes. That's how the DNR knows the difference.... LOL!!! Have always wonder that myself.... spot camp checks are not uncommon.
537714,Guest,2004-02-25 20:56:00,0,"I will be arriving on July 3rd, should be somewhere around noon. If your around look for a green Suburban with Wisconsin plates, pulling a white and blue Sylvan Eliminator. I'll trade you a beer for some fishing info. Brax"
537731,mp3553,2004-02-26 10:58:00,7,Your on! If it works out as previously stated... Look for a Green Toyota Tundra/Nebraska plates Catch me Sat night cause I'll be fishin @ noon!
537542,Guest,2004-02-18 13:07:00,0,"A group of six of us are going to Lac Seul this June for the first time ever. Would like to hear what the Lac Seul experts say is the best June presentation for Walleye. It sounds like the Walleye fishing is awesome there but I dont have the slightest idea what is the best bait or what kind of lures to use....Thanks,Jack"
537543,Guest,2004-02-18 13:36:00,0,"I will be up over the 4th of July and was there last year in September. We pretty much use spinners with either lindy weights or bottom bouncers and chubs. Last fall pink and white were unreal. We ran out of pink spinners by day three. Jigs also will do great depending on the areas fished and conditions. Bring lots of tackle because you will lose more than you think to rocks and slimers. I personally tie about 80 spinners for the week that I will be there. You will have a blast, I know I will be going back for many years to come."
537544,Guest,2004-02-18 13:56:00,0,I have been going to Lac Seul for years. I have the most luck in June fishing with my cane pole and my cute little red and white corks baited with waxworms. Last year was my best year ever. I caught 7 fish that week and the big one weighed almost 2 lbs. The guys I fish with let me hold their fish so I can get my picture taken with big fish but they wont let me hold my cane pole for the picture. This year I might take one of my little boys Mickey Mouse rod and reel if I can figure out how to use it.
537545,Guest,2004-02-18 14:29:00,0,I have had the misfortune of having to fish with Euker for years. He does look cute fishing with his cane pole and bobbers and his helicopter beany hat but he will never be able to learn how to use his kids rod and reel. The rest of the guys in our group fish with jig and minnow in June and work windy points for our best results. We also drag cranks on flats in 6 to 10 feet of water and last year that yielded many nice fish.
537546,Guest,2004-02-18 15:32:00,0,"MrBigeyes, I too will be fishing Lac Seul the week of the 4th. I am staying at Goose Bay up near Ear Falls. How about you? Brax"
537555,Guest,2004-02-19 07:00:00,0,"Lac Seul in June is not difficult to catch fish on. Make sure you work the windy points and windy sides of islands. Jigs, Bottom Bouncers, Lindy Rigs will all work. Minnows are the bait of choice for June and dragging cranks works well too. One of our favorite fish finders is to drag cranks and once we locate a fish concentration break out the jig/minnow. A depth finder will be a big help. During June the majority of fish will be shallow 6/12 ft and depending on what time in June they will be moving from spawning areas to main lake."
537561,orchard frank,2004-02-19 11:30:00,1900,"Also try sand and weed edges. Have had some amazing catches that time of year backtrolling bouncers or jigs in sand just deep enough for the bottom to disappear 4-8' depending on water color. Don't worry about motor noise and emerging weedlines can hold huge numbers as shallow as 2', suspending raps and shad raps work great for casting to these shallow fish."
537564,Otts,2004-02-19 12:06:00,119,"Brax, I have fished out of Goose Bay twice, three years ago and last year. Both times we fished early June. Have you fished there before? Otts"
537594,Guest,2004-02-19 23:33:00,0,dont forget to try below the dam. one year we were almost skunked when someone looking for fishing partners asked if we wanted to go below the dam in his boat. In half a day we got our limits of walleye and northers and the slot size does not count below the dam!
537638,Guest,2004-02-21 15:12:00,0,"Otts, I fished Lac Seul only once before about 3 years ago. I have been fishing Lake of the woods the last few years and thought I would give Lac Seul a try again. I stayed at Golden Fawn last time I was there, it's just NW of Goose bay. Last time I was there, the weather was against us so the fishing wasn't that good. A group in the next cabin said they have been going up there for 14 years and that was the first year they had to eat northers because the walleyes just weren't bitting. Along with that, we had our wives and kids with us, so we couldn't fish hard everyday. My wife no longer wants to go to Canada so it's just me and my boy (16 years old) that go every year. Looking forward to the great fishing everyone is talking about. MP3553 (a poster to this board)goes ever year to goose bay. He will be up there the week before me. I asked him about the water level since it was down so much last year and he said it was a little harder to navigate but he thought the fishing was a little better. Kind of same amount of fish less water kind of thing."
