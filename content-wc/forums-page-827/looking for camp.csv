537935,Guest,2004-03-04 19:44:00,0,I would also reccomend 5 lakes lodge. We have going there for 4 years now. Bud an Malinda are great hosts. The leave you alone unless you need something. If you do need something they will go the extra mile to help you out. The camp is clean and well equiped. I have visited all the camps on Gullrock and they have by far the nicest camp and equiment. Bud knows the lake very well and always has a good tip everyday to help you find the fish. The only problem you may have is getting in on the weeks that you want. Most people re-book every year.........so there is a reason for that! Good Luck and hope you find something their.......its is a great lake to fish! we go the second week on June every year........maybe we will see you there sometime Bud......not the camp owner-just the same first name

I've stayed at both Kingfisher, Tallpines and Lundy's. I remember both owners being somewhat young...why did they get out? From your postings, you seem to fish the south and southwest side of the lake...my history has been better on the north side, is it just me or was I using the wrong techniques? Value your opinion! Craig in Urbandale"
537263,Guest,2004-02-09 15:55:00,0,"A great camp to try would be Golden Hook camp on Gullrock. We have fished there many years and have always enjoyed ourselves. The ground is all level so there are no strains on ""old knees"". The owners are very accomadating. Give it a try! I believe they have a web page still."
537264,Trailerguy,2004-02-09 17:07:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Craig, I don't know exactly why they sold. I would guess some people find that a camp is a whole lot of work, and it wears on you. Also like most property, if you make some improvements and own it a few years the equity starts to look pretty good. Yes I fish the SW side a lot because its close for me. The north end is great too, I've gotten a bigger boat this winter so I'll be spending more time up there. Keynote, to the SE, needs more attention as well, so many spots, so little time..... :) :)"
537267,VANT,2004-02-09 18:39:00,68,"Hey Chummer, I have gone to Gullrock with the same bunch of guys for about 6 years now. We go the first week In August. We stay a McEwen's on Two Island Lake. Short boat ride up the river to Gullrock. The thing I like about McEwen's is that if Gullrock is too rough to go out on, you can usually get out on Two Island. We usually go to Gullrock, but have caught some nice eyes on Two Island and in the Chukuni River flowing out of Two Island. They are nice people too. I have talked to Bud at Five Lakes Lodge and looked at his website. Nice looking camp and he seems like a real straight shooter also. VANT"
537272,Guest,2004-02-09 20:29:00,0,Try Ross's Camp its great!
537273,Guest,2004-02-09 20:29:00,0,Try Ross's Camp its great!
537274,Guest,2004-02-09 23:23:00,0,"Have stayed at Tall Pines for the last couple of years, took the family up last July and had a blast. In talking to Pete and Donna they simply wanted to retire, that was the reason for selling. Pete did say he will be sticking around for a while to help the new owners with the transition. I don't think you could find a nicer place to stay. Great cabins, nice boats, nice fishhouse. If you choose Tall Pines I don't think you will be disappointed."
537279,Guest,2004-02-10 07:36:00,0,"Thanks for info on the other camps but like I said we're staying on Gullrock. we've enjoyed it thru the years it's pretty easy to fish plus you have the other lakes to fish if you want. Vant, I called Mcewens and they have sold also. Have you heard anything about the new owner?"
537286,Minnow Man,2004-02-10 09:46:00,85,"Hello Chummer Hugh & Audry left the camp in good hands. Mike & Tina Procyk are local folks from Balmertown. They are young & full of energy. They will be eager to please. Tina worked for Golden Hook Camp on Gullrock Lake for 5 years, so they have some working knowledge of the daily camp operation.They are in it for the long haul, and will do well. Don't be afraid to give them a try. Enjoy your trip."
537389,Guest,2004-02-12 18:31:00,0,"We are planning a trip there the end of July 2004 and will be staying at Lundy's Camp. What can you tell us for fishing advice and what about this particular camp. Thanks in advance, Rich"
537199,Guest,2004-02-07 09:28:00,0,I've been staying at Weaver's on Gullrock Lake for 12yrs. I got a letter saying that they sold the camp. I guess our group is looking at trying another camp on Gullrock. Anybody out there fish Gullrock if so any suggestion on where to look.
537202,Guest,2004-02-07 11:14:00,0,Give 5 Lakes Lodge a look. Bud's a good dude!
537203,Guest,2004-02-07 11:16:00,0,"I have been at Weavers for 15 years. Why change. Give Lee a chance. I have been communicating with him and he bends over backwards to help.It would be the last thing that Mike and Gerri would want is to abandon the camp now. If you still want to fish Gull rock, give Lee a chance."
537215,Guest,2004-02-08 07:48:00,0,"Hump1, our group getting a little older and the walk to the fish cleaning house was taking it toll on us. we like the camp and equipment just need a camp that's more centrally located (docks fishhouse ect.)it's a b#*ch getting old."
537222,Guest,2004-02-08 11:51:00,0,We've spent a lot of time fishing in the Ontario area. We like Lake Wabaskang for fishing and have stayed at a couple of different places. Tall Pines Camp was very nice and accommodating. Going back for a longer stay this summer.
537234,Guest,2004-02-08 21:28:00,0,"We have been going to Tall Pines Camp on Wabasakang Lake for several years and have found that when you make your reservation, you are assigned a specific cabin and the owners have always informed us of the location and layout of the cabin, so that we know exactly what we are getting. You can actually take an online tour of the cabins on the web site."
537237,Trailerguy,2004-02-09 05:56:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Wabaskang is a great lake, but I've been told that Tall Pines has been sold, as was Kingfisher late in the season last year. Rocky Shores on Perrault Lake and Cedar Point down on Cedar Lake also sold this winter."
537239,Guest,2004-02-09 07:01:00,0,"Thanks for info about Tall Pines but we plan on staying on Gullrock. I fished Wabaskang a few years back with some friends we caught some fish, but not like we do on Gullrock."
537242,Guest,2004-02-09 07:58:00,0,I was just recently at the Cedar Rapids Sportshow and met the new owners of Tall Pines and they are from Iowa and seem like really nice people!
537261,Guest,2004-02-09 15:19:00,0,"I second 5 lakes lodge. Bud, Malinda and the boys are great hosts and the facilities are great! All level ground and only 6 or 7 steps up from the docks....great for old knees! Also just a short trip off the main highway which means you can get out and to town (10 minutes away) if you get tired of your own cooking. I'll be up there 3 times this summer."
