537958,michric,2004-03-06 09:04:00,46,"Have gathered over time from many posts that the fishing quality in eastern Ontario does not measure up to western Ontario and seems largely due to fishing pressure and lack of catch and release. My question is that with slot limits and other protective measures do you think the fishing will measurably improve in the near future? Also, is it generally true that eastern Ontario waters lack the forage base that is found in places like Lac Suel, LOTW, etc?"
537967,Trophymuskie,2004-03-07 05:51:00,254,I don't know where your information is coming from but the best muskie fishing is in Eastern Ontario and the bay of Quinty produces countless walleyes over 10 lbs (many over 15) every single year. As well after Simco Eastern Ontario offers the best bass fishing. The only thing Western Ontario has on Eastern Ontario is a tonne more lodges and less population. Keep releasing them all Richard Collinhttp://www.trophymuskiecharters.com
537968,michric,2004-03-07 06:26:00,46,"Sorry, I guess I wasn't specific enough. I was refering to inland waters and more concerned about walleye, bass and pike fishing. I don't have real information but this is a general perception I have picked up reading posts on this site and others. Personally I have only made one trip so far (Spanish River area) and did quite well and considering more. Time constraints prevent the longer travel time to other places. I am curious if the Canadian people think the slot limits and other regulations will significantly help. Here in Michigan most moves by the DNR are not well supported."
537971,bigfish1965,2004-03-07 07:19:00,3210,I don't think the eastern Ontario waters are fairing any worse than places like you describe. They simply get more pressure and are more built-up. It is obviously less of a 'great outdoors' type of adventure. Eastern Ontario is more insulated fromt he border so less Americans visit and therefore you hear less about it. Places like Algonquin are amazing places to fish. EAstern Ontario and southern Ontario are generally far more 'Family friendly'. There's no place anywhere quite like Quinte to catch monster walleye.
537972,michric,2004-03-07 07:29:00,46,"Yeah, I hear what you're saying. All depends what you are looking for. I live 45 minutes from Saginaw bay so I wouldn't come to Canada looking specifically for big walleyes. Appreciate the reply."
537973,RANGER,2004-03-07 11:23:00,4341,"I'm not here to argue but I would have to say that your perceptions and info are pretty accurate. We fish Eastern Ontario inland waters and have witnessed the decline in fishing over the last 30+ years. I am not going to name all of the waters we have fished but it extends from the French River/Nipissing area through the Georgian Bay on to the Trent-Severn and Rideau systems through the Thousand Islands/St. Lawrence and up to the Ottawa area. Simcoe and Quinte are another world entirely. The fishing slowly, and seriously, declined. Arguably, overfishing is the result of the lack of size and creel limits throughout Easteren Ontario. Ontario finally set limits in these areas approximately 9 years ago and I understand that it has helped the fishery tremendously. The reason I say that I ""understand"" is because we haven't been back to the French River/Georgian Bay/Trent-Severn/Rideau areas for about 7 years opting to fish in the Eastern most region of the Province. We would really like to get back to the French River but that is a long drive to get ""skunked"" as has happened prior to our abandonment of that area!"
537975,michric,2004-03-07 17:41:00,46,"Actually I wasn't trying to pit one area against another. Just curious if the protective regulations were perceived by the public as working. And taking into account forage base. I gather from your comments that things are improving with a ways to go from the levels of your previous experience. Our expectations are the most important factor in the ""success"" of any trip. My son and I have made an annual week-long fishing trip every year for the last 12 years and finally made it to Canada last year. Due to job time constraints the next 6-8 years we will be limited to 4-5 hours of driving once we cross the bridge at the Sault. And I am confident that we will enjoy good fishing in a wilderness setting in this part of Ontario. Thanks for your observations."
537976,RANGER,2004-03-07 18:16:00,4341,"michric, The fact that you and your son are going to ""Canada"" is all that is needed. Fishing aside, that time together is the most important thing for the two of you! We absolutely love going there and look forward to it every time. The time spent together with friends and the ""Shield"" are priceless!!!! I did not intend to give you the impression that I was pitting one area against another. Simply trying to give you an idea of how hard we have tried to find that ""Honey Hole"" given the decline in fishing success! We are hoping that the French will come back. We put most of our years up there. Enjoy your trip with your boy!!"
