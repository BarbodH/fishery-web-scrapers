537759,BD,2004-02-27 16:55:00,739,You could try the Winnebago Walleyes / Outdoors First message boards. There are several trips / outings planed by the muskie fishermen. They accept eye guys along on their outings.http://walleye.outdoorsfirst.com/boa...egory-view.asphttp://muskie.outdoorsfirst.com/boar....asp?catlock=1 You might also try to find a FOCAS (Fellowship of Christian Anglers) group in your area. You could get to know some great people and get in on outings or perhaps a trip.http://www.focas.org/http://www.focas.org/chapters.html You could also try getting your own trip together. There are some good fishing camps and lodges that you could go to with only two people (IMHO four to eight people is better) and have a great time.
