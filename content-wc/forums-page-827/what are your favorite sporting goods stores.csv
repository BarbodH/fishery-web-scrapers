However, that doesn't necessarily make them a favourite. They compete very well price wise on what they stock. However, ""what they stock"" can leave a lot to be desired. Consequently, smaller stores compete on the service side by being prepared to get you what you want even though you'll pay more. Ordering via the internet (e.g. Cabela's, Bass Pro Shops, Stamina's), although the process works very well from my own experience, tends to be prohibitively expensive due to duties and shipping costs. According to the Bass Pro Shop web site, Bass Pro Shops has announced it will open an Outdoor World retail store in the new Vaughan Mills mall near Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The mall is scheduled to open late 2004."

537763,bigfish1965,2004-02-27 22:17:00,3210,Cabelas will never get another dime out of me. Canadian Tire or local tackle/bait stores from now on.

537645,Guest,2004-02-21 23:29:00,0,My bad. I didn't see the Canadian aspect of the thread. Canada needs a cabelas or two. I don't think anything can compare to it or a place like Thorne Bros. At least not the places I've visited in Canada.

537651,Guest,2004-02-22 08:22:00,0,"I like Scheels, Flleet Farm , Cbellas, Gander mt. and Bass Pro. Locally it would be Fleet Farm. They have really done a nice job with tackle. i buy rods and reels from Scheels. Great stuff."
537657,Wawajake,2004-02-23 08:01:00,413,"Since you asked for a Canadian fishermans perspective. I myself ussually support the local small type ""fishing tackle"" stores since although they don't have the selection that a Cabela's does they have the selection focused to what works in local waters, and besides they help pay my City taxes. When that fails to have what I need, I go to the local Canadian Tire Store, that ussually has all that I need and at reasonable prices. jake"
