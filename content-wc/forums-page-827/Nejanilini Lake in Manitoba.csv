537777,Guest,2004-02-29 15:07:00,0,"In reply to the question ""if someone had ever fished Nejanilini Lake"" I built Nejanilini Lodge (started building the new lodge in 1986 and finished in late 1987) I sold it in 1994. I built there because it was one of the strongest fisheries know in the remote north and it was one of the few large lakes that had never been commercially fished. It has a very short season but in July and August, it has some of the best fishing for Arctic Graying, Lake Trout and Pike that money can buy. It has some great fly fishing opportunities also."
