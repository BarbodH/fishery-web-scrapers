Get three bills of sale, one for the trailer because it has to be plated, one for the boat because you must get canadian registration numbers. Tell eveyone same old motor had it for years. Since you don't have to register the outboard motor, nobody has to know about it. Except everyone on Walleye Central,& we won't tell."

537871,Guest,2004-03-01 14:26:00,0,"I just bought a used boat this weekend from Michigan and brought it back to Canada with no problems. I had the title for the boat stamped by the sellers bank and a bill of sale for the boat and motor and bill of sale for the trailer. Paid the GST and PST on the boat and motor bill of sale, then the GST on the Trailer, will have the pay the PST on the trailer when registering, also had to pay $182 to register the trailer and will have to have it inspected before putting a plate on it. The customs guys started to ask about the title for the trailer and I indicated that the Registrar only wanted a bill of sale with the VIN on it to ensure it complied with US regulations then it would be admissable in Canada (also made sure the boat and motor where built in the US so I paid no duty). This was a private deal so not sure if the same rules about new boat from a dealer? Hope this helps."

They told me because the trailer I bought had a sticker on it that stated from the manufacturer that this vehicle conforms to all standards under the Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Regulations that I would not have to get it safety checked. One month after I had it plated I received a registered letter stating get a safety check or turn the trailer plates back in. All phone calls fell on deaf ears, Had to get a safety check. It was a good deal and worth the effort."

This is IMHO a ""grab"" to discourage US manufacturers from competing with Canadian manufactures of trailers. It is payable on the spot as is the GST. Beyond that I'm not sure what else might apply. I've been told that Canadians can license ""homemade"" ;) trailers for a minumal fee."

537771,Minnow Man,2004-02-29 07:49:00,85,"Bought a brand new cargo 12 ft trailer in the States last year, had to pay a two hundred dollar import fee, you must pay the gst tax at the border.Then pay your pst at time of registration. You must also take the trailer in for a safety inspection. This fee is suppose to be covered in the $200.00 import fee. Took the trailer into Canadian Tire in Kenora, the shop forman wanted to charge a $65.00 inspection fee. I explained that was double dipping because he would be getting paid twice, Sorry but I lost it and told him to go to ####. Took the trailer to Canadian Tire in Winnipeg, the inspection was done in 10 minutes and no charge to me. this is all required before you can get a trailer license plate. Suggest if you buy a boat to use a customs broker. Good Luck"
