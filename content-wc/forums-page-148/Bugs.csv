6214684,HeHooksHimself,2018-06-28 16:19:00,725,"Ok then, I thought black flies were housefly looking critters that bite you ankles, especially when you wear white socks. All this time I thought I thought they were some type of gnat. Thanks for the info."
6214798,BornToFish,2018-06-28 19:50:00,1224,"Greetings,Based on my understanding, ankle biters and black flies are completely different insects. As Ricky pointed out, black flies are like a fruit fly on steroids. They tend to come in swarms and just swirl around your head, taking turns making their bombing runs. Ankle biters are more like a house fly that bite through shoes and socks. Generally speaking, I believe that ankle biters tend to come out after the black flies are on their way out.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6214872,Skywagon,2018-06-29 05:36:00,1106,"Black flies are totally different creatures than ankle biters, the itchy welts will last for days from these guys. Also beware that they tend to get at you from wherever they can (not just around your head), I have several red welts this morning above my sock line from where they had crawled up my pant leg yesterday. Some locations seem to be worse for them than others."
6225014,hoppy63,2018-07-23 10:47:00,367,"Back from june 23-30 trip out of Nakina. I started this post so figured should update it. As someone else posted, the mosquitoes took it to whole new level. Plenty of black flies too. Was my first trip that early in year and when we got to Nakina, I wondered what I had gotten myself into. Fortunately and oddly (I thought) the bugs did not seem as bad once we flew in, as they were at Nakina. They were still plenty bad, I do t want to be misunderstood. My finances....pretty much the bug sprays worked pretty much the same, and that is to say they worked well. I think most were 30% dete or more. And my first time.e using thermo cells.....I'm.a believer. I will be buying some!"
6225058,Palancar,2018-07-23 11:56:00,52,"Buy 2 loaves of bread. Texas toast size bags. Remove bread. Cut open the closed end of the bag. Pull a bag over your foot and up your calf. Repeat. Put a rubber band around top and bottom of bag pulling bag down as far as possible. Flys won't bite through plastic. They will bite thrugh double socks, thick socks, etc. Not plastic! Cheap, safe, reusable, and it works. Keep two rolled up in your tackle box or boat."
6225780,martinbns,2018-07-25 10:41:00,1520,OR just before you put your shoes on spray your lower legs generously with deep woods off and wear your shorts on the boat. 8-10 hours maybe 1-2 bites
6226774,Aspencreek,2018-07-27 21:25:00,2911,"Thermocell under my boat seat, Permethrin sprayed on the clothing, and for Mosquitoes....I found this stuff from Buggins, really works well. All that and every northern gets a boatside release. Not allowed in the boat, that slime is a attractant for every fly within a 1/2 mile."
6227626,BigRedSmokey,2018-07-30 14:45:00,13,My group is headed to NW Ontario the first week of Sept. Anyone been there during this time frame that can give me a bug report?
6227642,martinbns,2018-07-30 16:38:00,1520,"By the end of September there will essentially be no bugs left. Even today, black flies are long gone, mosquitos are on there way out now, lots of ankle biters (spray your naked legs below the knee with copious amounts of deep woods off, then put your shoes or sandals on), horse flies and deer flies just starting. Spray your hat all over including the inside of the brim, wear an old cruddy one so when it fades you don't care, wear neutral colours like beige or baby blue and wraparound sunglasses so nothing can ever get behind them."
6227686,hoppy63,2018-07-30 18:16:00,367,"I have usually gone in September. Like previous post said, black flies nearly non existent, might run into a few if you portage. Skeeter's can be pretty bad especially at dusk, but after dark they are gone. Makes for beautiful stargazing and beer drinking!!! My favorite time to go."
6211580,PRO-V16,2018-06-21 09:07:00,454,"I just bought another 24oz jug of Sawyer's permethrin for $14. It will treat 8 full outfits of clothes. Hang them up in your garage, spray until moist and let dry. Will work for 40 days. My son says all the linemen in their company uses permethrin and it works great. You can additionally put bug spray on your exposed skin if need be."
6211760,Bill Krejca,2018-06-21 16:10:00,6107,"I'm not aware of a brand name being better than another, could be, but whatever I happen to have seems to work pretty well in stopping the itch, I've used different brands.. Bill"
6214356,DaBirdman,2018-06-27 19:41:00,164,About what time of year do the bugs start to die off? September? Or when there's a foot of snow? Ha
6214374,martinbns,2018-06-27 20:28:00,1520,"Depends on which bug you are talking about. Black flies will be over soon, mosquitos are just getting going and will be around in bunches until august, Horse & Deer flies will be out by the end of July in big numbers. For a time with no bugs at all, November."
6214384,DaBirdman,2018-06-27 20:57:00,164,"Thanks! That pretty much covers the spectrum. Hopefully the noseeums or whatever they are, will be gone by August as well."
6214406,martinbns,2018-06-27 22:35:00,1520,They should be.
6214428,Skywagon,2018-06-28 05:18:00,1106,"Permethrin works better than anything, the Sawyer brand is for clothes, but only spray it on your clothes ahead of time and let them dry like PRO-V16 suggests, it is not to be put on your body. Deer ticks are starting to move into Northwest Ontario, 70% have been found to carry Lime disease, we have found 2 on our property that tested positive for Lime, something to be aware of."
6214560,HeHooksHimself,2018-06-28 10:40:00,725,"We went in on June 8 for a week right when the bugs started showing up. We were swarmed for the week by mosquitoes. As annoying as the skeeters were, what really got me and another guy was these gnats. I had welts all over me and felt like I was full of venom. They are big enough to see so I dont think they are noseeums. It seems like every few years these blood suckers get me but this year was by far the worst. Anybody know what they are?"
6214582,Ricky Spanish,2018-06-28 12:11:00,1298,"Black flies. Looked like a fruit fly on steroids, right? They were pretty bad in Iron County, WI at the end of May."
6214586,BornToFish,2018-06-28 12:18:00,1224,"Greetings,I concur with Ricky.Black flies tend to swarm around my head as they take turns making their bombing run. They tend to focus on biting me under my hat brim at the hairline. Another favorite target is the hairline above my shirt collar. I have also been bitten many times under the band of my wristwatch.It seems to be that they inject an anesthetic before they bite, as I rarely feel the bite. Then, the bite itches like all **** for several days.Black flies love to fly into ears, noses and eye glasses. I am sure it is a purposeful plan to distract me while I am being bitten some where else.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6210182,That Minnesota guy,2018-06-18 15:41:00,8293,With all the Dollar Stores around these days I suggest stocking up on fly swatters. I have several in the boat and it provides entertainment while trolling.
6210192,pjshorthorn,2018-06-18 15:49:00,5654,I have a lotion. Not sure if it is offered in a spray. I haven't had any black fly issues when I use it..... Maybe I just stink enough to keep the flies away. PjShorthorn
6210204,kona77,2018-06-18 16:09:00,236,Our group always takes bug suits (tops and bottoms) on our trips and they work great for any kind of biting insect.. They are also comfortable fishing in on warm days.. They weigh very little and take up hardly in space when packing for a fly-in..
6210272,jaym,2018-06-18 18:47:00,89,"A couple of years ago after reading a Consumer Reports article on Repel lemon eucalyptus insect repellent, which they rated excellent for mosquitos, we tried it out on our Canadian fishing trip. It worked great on mosquitos and black flies. It's all natural and we use it wherever we go. Even got the resort owner using it now."
6210440,HeHooksHimself,2018-06-19 06:25:00,725,We got back over the weekend from a Nakina based flyout. Whatever your defense is for bugs bring it. The mosquitoes last week took it to a level I have never seen before. I am also prone to reactions from gnats. I returned feeling like I was full of venom and one big itch. Cortisone cream helped the itch and traditional sprays worked for a short time. This is why we usually go opening week! Fish On! Hooks
6210592,Bill Krejca,2018-06-19 09:48:00,6107,Chap Sick (or some similar type) seems to work pretty well for relieving itching of bites. Bill
6210906,hoppy63,2018-06-20 05:44:00,367,Can this be put on clothes that will be against your skin ???
6210908,hoppy63,2018-06-20 05:45:00,367,Chap stick for itch???? First I've heard of that. Any certain type??
6210910,hoppy63,2018-06-20 05:48:00,367,"Thanks for all of the replies......lot of great ideas. I will try several and see what seems to work best for me. By the sounds on the bug situation, it will be quite a test!!! Leave Thursday night for Nakina!"
6211578,BCNeal,2018-06-21 08:59:00,19,Permethrin can be used against the skin once it's dried on your clothing. We use it on Boundary Waters canoe trips. The stuff works.
6202892,SterlingArcher,2018-06-01 08:21:00,92,"Long-sleeved shirts, a buff for your neck, and pants. There are lots of options made of really light, breathable material so you can cover up and be comfortable even if it's hot out. I usually don't even use bug spray any more once I figured out that the best defense is to not give them anything to bite. Plus it keeps the melanoma boogeyman at bay."
6202904,pjshorthorn,2018-06-01 08:33:00,5654,"I do pretty much the same thing. Lightweight pants ( beige and olive green colors ) that can be unzipped at the thigh to make them into shorts if you want. Long sleeve shirts that have UV protection and moisture wicking properties........all in bright colors........you'll never be mistaken which boat I'm in. I haven't gone to a buff yet,but I do lather up my neck ,face,nose and ears pretty good with Coppertone Sport spf 30 or 50 which also helps with black fly control. As far as skeeters.....I just pee on them , they get drunk and then they fly into hard surfaces and die. Too bad,so sad for the skeeters. PjShorthorn"
6202996,prov1800,2018-06-01 11:56:00,5010,Would like to thank all you guys for coming up here to Canada and feeding our bugs.seems to be helping as there not very hungry so far.please keep coming up.your doing a great job.
6203048,martinbns,2018-06-01 13:50:00,1520,"Best post on the threadI lived in Ft McMurray for a number of years at the 57* of Lat, that far north each species never really burns off they stuck around all summer. I distinctly remember going to Edmonton for a meeting and deciding to take a walk thinking how nice it was there was no bugs, then went back to my hotel room and the lead story on the news was Edmonton being overun with aggresive mosquitos.Perspective..."

6204454,wallydave,2018-06-05 04:37:00,2151,A good cigar will keep the bugs away! Repeat as needed!
6205190,prov1900,2018-06-06 07:27:00,544,Bufff headwear all the way. I use it for sun protection mainly after getting some skin cancer removed earlier this year (not fun in the least). They really help with the bugs too. Black flies love the behind the ear area and the Buff keeps them out.
6207126,hoppy63,2018-06-10 19:28:00,367,"Appreciate all the replies. Have good repellent, head net, and cover. Will use surgical gloves on hands if needed. Thinking about the thermocell. As long as the eyes are biting,we'll be OK! Good luck to all!"
6208974,BlueJayBert,2018-06-15 10:26:00,15,Is the Coppertone Sport SPF 30 a spray or a lotion? Does it work on Black Flies? Thanks for the info.
6210062,martinbns,2018-06-18 11:44:00,1520,"Notice to our Bugfeeding American friends. Black flies are officially out, we were out yesterday on Lake of the Woods in the Northern half and anywhere near shore they were pretty bad by our standards. Deep Woods Off worked like a charm, sprayed our hats and exposed legs and they became very bearable."
6202276,hoppy63,2018-05-30 20:43:00,367,"I'm going to post a question that I know is asked every year. I know I can ""search"" and find plenty of info, but I like to see if there are any new ideas. What is everyone's best defense on black flies.....lotions, repellents, do therma cells work, etc.....interested in your input."
6202280,That Minnesota guy,2018-05-30 20:46:00,8293,Thermo Cells in the cabin and boat. Coils in the outhouse and in front of the cabin door on the outside. 2 pairs of socks for the biting flies.
6202294,Golden Eagle,2018-05-30 21:02:00,2642,"I returned Sunday from fishing 9 days on Little Vermilion Lake in NW Ontario. Zero bug bites. Spraying my cap with Deet kept early black flies from doing damage. Tilling my garden and cutting my grass Tuesday I got 2 mosquito bites and picked up 1 tick.I packed 2 fly swatters, to kill ankle biters on my July 14 week at same lake."
6202336,DaBirdman,2018-05-31 04:03:00,164,"We use an insect repellent called BuggSpray and it works fantastic. Repels biting flies, mosquitoes and ticks. Don't know if it comes in big bottles, but we find it in small brown bottles and bring 4 of them on our trips up north. Use it mostly for biting flies. Just spray from the knees on down and no worries! Otherwise for mosquitoes we just use a Deep Woods Off with a high concentration of deet."
6202362,big popi,2018-05-31 05:59:00,635,"The best spray I have found is Coppertone 30 Sport SPF 30, does a good job keeping the flies off my legs (if it's hot I wear shorts) and keeps me from burning."
6202388,BornToFish,2018-05-31 07:03:00,1224,"Greetings,I found that most of the bug sprays work pretty much the same. I keep a head-net over my hat when they get particularly bothersome. I keep it over my ears and neck all the time. I pull it over my face when they get bad enough.Someone once posted on a similar thread that nothing seems to work as well as September. I think there is merit to his idea.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6202602,PRO-V16,2018-05-31 14:46:00,454,Buy Permethrin and spray down all your clothes ahead of time. Do it in your garage or outside if not windy. Spray until damp and let dry. Will last for weeks. Have thought about spraying on the boat carpet but keep forgetting.
6202694,martinbns,2018-05-31 18:29:00,1520,"Wear light coloured clothes like beige and light blue, spray over top with deet based fly dope, spray your hat liberally including under the bill and lastly where wraparound sunglasses that fit tight to your head. If you can't see them or have them get in behind your glasses I find I barely notice them. I was out tuesday fishing shallow bays with 50 yards of shore most of the day and barely noticed them. I was wearing shorts with a longsleeved fishing tshirt."
6202712,Live to jig,2018-05-31 19:22:00,159,"Going to give this a shot this year for sitting on the deck at camp and even while fishing the night bite when it is dead calm, this is a bigger unit and I think it should work well. The smaller unit makes early season deer hunting bearable here in the south. https://www.thermacell.com/products/backpacker-repeller"
6202872,tv4fish,2018-06-01 07:51:00,2694,"I think the best use of the Thermacell is on a calm day/night when you are sitting outside on a deck or other unenclosed area. It will work for your boat, of course, but if it's windy - not so much."
