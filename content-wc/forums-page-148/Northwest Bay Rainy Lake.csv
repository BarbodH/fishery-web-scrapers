Sounds like they caught only a few pike, lots of bass, and ONLY 10 walleyes! That is very unusual.... almost backwards between bass and walleyes. Last year I was up there and it was tough, but we got some walleyes in Northwest Bay. This year, 10 is almost like goose egging over the course of a week. Our family has been going there for over 40 years, but it's been 30 years since the walleye fishing was that tough. I don't know if the numbers of bass are having a negative impact on the walleye population or what. It's a bit discerning. Last year I had to boat some 12-20 miles from camp to get on the real good numbers. Just odd."

6224816,DaBirdman,2018-07-22 19:58:00,164,"Thanks! My folks got home yesterday and we visited a bit about their trip. Daytime water temps are up around 78 and on Friday morning they did find a few walleyes along the weeds. But they never fished deeper than 12ft... which unfortunately is fishing memories. Most of the time you can catch a lot of fish in 8-12ft, but water temps that warm, they probably should've been looking in 15-25ft during the daytime. I know what you're saying though about the fishing up around Manitou and Ash. Last year when I took my family with, I ventured out in my boat 12-20 miles from camp and had excellent fishing. I tried to convince my folks to go out that far to where I found them last year, but I don't think they feel comfortable doing that and prefer to stay closer to camp. We always go to LaBelle's and even Dale told them that Northwest Bay has been real slow this year. And when he says that, means it's awfully tough fishing. My dad talked to some guys in the fish cleaning shack and they were having success a long way from camp as well. Nobody did well in Northwest Bay I guess. Good thing for my dad.... he'll have a chance to more than make up for it when we do our fly-in trip in 2 weeks!"
6224818,CoryV,2018-07-22 20:10:00,32,"I was at Camp Narrows. I had to run far as well. NW Bay was super slow from what I was told. All that middle lake stuff (woodchuck area) where the water doesn’t get very deep was slow. You’re dead right, water was too warm in those areas."
6224834,DaBirdman,2018-07-22 20:38:00,164,"Yeah last year we did well around the Cherry Island area. Nothing huge, but loads of eaters. I've been up to the Cascade and up into Paddy before, but never really fished them much. Fishing Ash is definitely on my to-do list though. Have heard there's some real hogs around there. Water is noticeably deeper and clearer up there."
6224982,CoryV,2018-07-23 09:43:00,32,I did well on the big water and ash was good too. Ash is worth going to just because of how pretty it is. absolutely incredible. Rainy Lake is a very special place...
