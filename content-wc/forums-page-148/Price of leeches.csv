6225176,Guest,2018-07-23 15:32:00,0,$60 a pound in Kenora
6225212,Guest,2018-07-23 18:27:00,0,Holy Crapola! I paid only $45cad in Sioux Lookout for a pound.
6225214,Guest,2018-07-23 18:30:00,0,Although I had to order ahead from my fly in outfitter. This time of year they are having a hard time getting leeches from their trapper they say. I'm happy they pulled through for me.
6225218,Obabikon,2018-07-23 19:07:00,2370,Price is probably going up as they get later in the season too. It's been pretty hard to find leeches the past few weeks in our area.
6225246,Bstar,2018-07-23 20:46:00,564,You're talking about Queen Street Laundromat. Give them a call or email them. They are good people to deal with. You can pre-order too. http://www.qsltackle.ca/
