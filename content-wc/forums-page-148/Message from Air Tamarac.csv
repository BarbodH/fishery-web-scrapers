5903706,Andre (wallyandre),2017-12-19 11:15:00,2274,"From their Facebook page: Dear sportsmen and friends, Once again we find ourselves at the end of another successful year and, into the spirit of the Holiday Season, we wish to extend our heartfelt gratitude to all our customers who, for the last 23 years, have trusted us. We thank you for your support and wish you Happy Holidays and a year filled with health, peace, love and happiness. 2017 IN REVIEW Spring 2017 will be remembered, as one of the latest ice out we've ever experienced. But unlike the year before, the situation did not slow down the harvest of larger walleyes and, at the end, the season was great at both Lake Hébert and Gouin Réservoir. 2017 was the second year of implementation of the 13-18,5 inches slot limit for walleye at Gouin Reservoir and we already reap the benefits! We have always encouraged this measure. Air Tamarac is a leader and pioneer in the field, having imposed such a rule at Lake Hébert 15 years ago. Furthermore, our northern pike fishing experience towards the end of the season is back to where it belongs with many trophy pikes caught and released in late August and early September, especially on Gouin Reservoir. Check out some great catches at www.tamarac.ca. In terms of projects and renovations, the season has been very busy with, among other things, the replacement of several docks, the addition of slow combustion wood stoves in all our cottages and new mattresses for each and every cabin on Lake Hébert; but also a crazy year with two major projects: the acquisition of Air Melançon in the spring and then the construction at the end of the season of a staff house in Clova. With excellent fishing quality, refurbished cabins, aluminum boats with new outboards, satellite phones at each camp and a young, reliable and courteous team, Air Tamarac intends to remain a must for anglers and hunters. Now with brook trout fishing and moose hunting, Air Tamarac has it all! THE ACQUISITION OF AIR MELANÇON AND OTHER NEWS FOR 2018 Thus, Air Tamarac acquired a seaplane base in the Mont-Laurier region and takes control of Sauterelle Outfitter, a territory with exclusive hunting and fishing rights located only 35 minutes north of Ste- Anne-du-Lac as the crow flies. Air Tamarac is therefore taking a turn in its services by adding brook trout fishing and moose hunting. Sauterelle Lake is 7 km long and is part of a chain of lakes with 3 chalets on the main lake and 2 others on isolated lakes. This territory of 60 km2 has been well preserved by the Melançon Family since 1957 and, faithful to its reputation, Air Tamarac intends to offer it to you in top condition. With this transaction Air Tamarac adds two more Beavers seaplanes to its existing fleet of 4 aircraft to ensure reliable and safe service at each base. The expansion of the activities allows Air Tamarac to become a must for avid outdoorsmen and to remain a leader in fishing and hunting in Quebec for several years to come; this achievement at Air Tamarac having been planned in concert with our next generation! Proud of the quality of improvements made over the last 23 years, the work that has begun will continue so that all of our territories offer the same level of service that Air Tamarac has accustomed you to. For example, we have just acquired 8 Princecraft Yukon 15 boats and new mattresses for Lac de la Sauterelle and will also be carrying out several renovations of docks and boardwalks at Sauterelle, Gouin and Lac Hébert to complete what was started in 2017. We are constantly improving and looking for new grounds so stay tuned on our page as we may very well announce a new pike, walleye and moose hunting private lake in a near future! Please note that, for the duration of your stay, Air Médic protection for emergency medical evacuation by helicopter remains included in our packages. A big plus when booking with Air Tamarac!

5906050,fishron,2017-12-20 14:52:00,317,It's good to hear that Air Tam is expanding their operation. They know how to provide a great trip and the addition of an airbase reachable on hardtop roads is a plus. I was pleased and surprised to find my photo holding one of many good walleyes taken on my trips to Hebert on this years brochure. I've got a lot of questions to ask them at the Harrisburg show in 2018.
