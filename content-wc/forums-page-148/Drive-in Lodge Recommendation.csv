6226660,Krieghoff,2018-07-27 15:12:00,3,"My wife and I are looking for a drive in or boat in lodge with an American plan for 2019. We are an older couple and getting in the boat is not the easiest anymore. We are not crippled but not as agile as we once were. We have looked at Bow Narrows but have not heard much about them. Need comfortable boats and we don't like big water. Not necessarily specicies specific other than walleye & northern. Price range is $1,000 to $1,200 per person for the week. Thank you for your recommendation"
6226672,Bstar,2018-07-27 15:22:00,564,"Check out Stormer Lake Lodge. Smaller water, nice boats and American plan. It's in your price range especially in September. https://redlakeontariofishing.com/"
6226698,Hawker,2018-07-27 16:39:00,3967,"Check out Young's Wilderness Camp (youngswildernesscamp.com). Its a drive to, boat in lodge, very nice & comfortable boats, excellent food, excellent staff, very nice modern yet rustic cabins, GREAT owners who care about their guests."
6226718,BornToFish,2018-07-27 18:06:00,1224,"Greetings,I second the recommendation for Stormer Lake Lodge. There is a current thread going on this forum with several independent trip reports - just scroll down a page or two to find it.The lodge staff will likely take you, your wife and your gear to/from your cabin from/to the dock in a golf cart, if need be. They will assist you into and from the boat. There is even a designated ""handicapped"" courtesy drop off point at the shorelunch spot!Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6226764,ManitowishWaters,2018-07-27 21:00:00,39,"It would be silly to look anywhere else but Stormer Lake Lodge. Go and never go elsewhere again. 619 eyes in 5 days last year 38 and 42"" pike. Only gonna keep track of over 20"" eyes this year. Can't wait till Aug 11!"
6226902,Obabikon,2018-07-28 10:09:00,2370,"If go to Stormer Lake Lodge in the fall, you can be in your price range. Sounds like a pretty good option."
6226920,BornToFish,2018-07-28 11:18:00,1224,"Greetings,I just checked in on this thread to see how it was going. I noticed that the original poster goes by the name ""Krieghoff"". That name resonated with me as I shoot a K-80 midgrade for skeet and sporting clays. Good fishing, Tight Lines and Good Shooting!!"
6226956,Krieghoff,2018-07-28 14:58:00,3,"Thank you very much for the recommendations. I will check each of them out. I've never been to Canada in September, is the fishing good?"
6226960,Obabikon,2018-07-28 15:16:00,2370,"my favorite month of the year. Almost no bugs, schooled up fishing, cooler weather... love September!"
6226970,BornToFish,2018-07-28 15:56:00,1224,"Greetings,September is also my favorite time of the season to fish in NW Ontario. Obabikon cited several excellent reasons for this choice. Nothing works quite as well as September to address bugs. The fish are schooled up on structure. You know where they all are if you can find one fish. There are fewer boats on most lakes as many families have their children in school. Many outdoorsman are preoccupied with things back home such as archery deer season, bear and waterfowl hunting.The one down side of fishing in September can be the weather. The weather on any given day can be the best of the season or the worst of the season. You might have both in the same day.There is one key thing about fishing for walleyes. It's important to select a lake with the size and numbers of fish that you want to target. If you choose such a lake, the fishing will be excellent in each week/month of the season. How and where on the lake you fish for these fish is what might change during each week/month of the season. Fishing in spring is very different than fishing during September.If you pick a lake that doesn't have the fish that you want to target, it doesn't matter where on the lake or when you fish there.In my opinion, Stormer and Kirkness Lakes boast a world-class population of walleyes in terms of size and numbers. The northern pike fishery is very good. My opinion is based on having fished these lakes for about twenty weeks.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
