This will be the second year we have gone to an American plan lodge last year it was Watson's Kaby Lodge a terrific camp great food incredible owners my wife and kids loved it and I was able to spend about 4 hrs a day fishing so when my wife asked to go again Lodge 88 looked like a nice fit. Never have too much trouble finding fish but with limited time if anyone would care to share a few way points close to camp just to get me started would sure appreciate it since I have limited time to figure the system out. I really don't have time for a guide never liked the idea. Has anyone ever just ask and paid for a map from a guide I would go for that. If you have any gps way points near Lodge 88 I'd be thankful. Making another video this year here is last years trip to Watson's Kaby Lodge I would probably go there again but the wife enjoys new lakes she really doesn't fish but loves the solitude

I'd just book the lake I want to fish to maximize the minimal time and be able to be productive. If she doesn't really fish, get on water that will deliver what YOU are looking for! I would never take my wife to Canada. She would hate it from the first 5 minutes there until we where home. Now I do have to send her on a girls trip somewhere in exchange. I get it if the only way you can go to Canada to fish is to bring her, but she needs to be flexible on what lake you want to fish. Hire a guide! The lakes up there are mostly massive, and a good guide for a day can set you up for years to come. I've done it twice in 16 years. Both on Lac Seul. Massive lake and now I have a TON of spots to hit on my own. Even the suggestion with the $100 and a beer is worth more than $100. Don't feel like you are stooping low to hire a guide. Every fishing book and magazine encourage it, and the guys that write the books and articles are pros, but don't know new bodies of water either. The pros hire guides, and so should all of us!"

I used the word ""usually"" as not all guides are equal in their knowledge of fish, knowledge of the body of water, fishing skills and ability to teach fishing.I would expect the lodge owner to mark up a map for you, at the minimum. After all, it's in his/her best interest for you and your family to have a good time fishing from his/her fishing lodge. However, not all lodge owners are equal in terms of their ability to fish or knowledge of their body of water.The original poster might want to get to know other anglers at the dining room or dock. Many anglers are willing to help others, especially first-timers at the lodge.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

I would buy a subscription to his online magazine and give him a call. I believe there is a nice write up by him on that lake. If by chance you get all the way down the lake most open water rock shoals were marked with milk jugs and we did real well on walleyes there. lots of quality eyes, its about a 13-15 mile ride to the far end. Good luck walleye warrior.... Halfmoon"
