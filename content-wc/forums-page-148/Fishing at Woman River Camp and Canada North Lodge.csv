I have not been up to Ontario fishing for about 7 years so I am beyond excited to head back up north for a week of beautiful scenery and fishing. The last time I went to Ontario we fished Sturgeon Lake and it was in July. Since this will be my first time at Woman River Camp. I was wondering if anybody who has stayed at Woman River Camp or Canada North Lodge could give me some pointers or reports on how the fishing has been so far this season or in the past. I mostly prefer vertical jigging or casting for walleye and pike, but want to make sure that I cover my basis and bring the right gear for fishing in August when I assume the fish will be deeper. Any tips or advice on the main lakes/portage lake or August fishing techniques would be so much appreciated."

I understand they are deeper this time of year, it'll be my first year in the fall. Minnows are always the best, but crawlers worked for the guys last year. We stay at the Outpost, where are you staying? Check in with HeHooksHimself, he's got a ton of knowledge for WRC."

6226590,wooglin,2018-07-27 12:06:00,371,At the resort or the Outpost?
6226594,redhawkbb20,2018-07-27 12:08:00,4,At the main camp/resort
6226596,wooglin,2018-07-27 12:14:00,371,"Gotcha. The outpost is about 16 miles up system, if I remember correctly. I understand that boats head north from the resort and was pretty common from what my group said at last Sept trip, so expect to put some miles on. I haven't heard much from this year other than the WRC newsletter they send out. I also hear the water is down quite a bit, but it was down last year too."
6227030,HeHooksHimself,2018-07-28 21:11:00,725,"Hello Red, I have been to WRC a few times through the years. We have always had a great experience with Paul and Debbie. I really like how they do things- no BS, no nickle and dimeing. Paul will put you on fish. He has begun to furnish depth finders and that really helps. The system is large with lots of opportunity. Most recently (last Sept.) we stayed at the outpost. It is closer to our preferred fishing spots. Bring a cigar or two for Bruce and he will hook you up. We always use minnows, but have had some success with plastics. I caught a 42"" pike there a few years back. Best walleyes in the summer are at the saddle and in Big Woman. Try some of the portages for a change of pace. We like Narrow lake. Snakeweed is worth the effort. We have also fished Spot Lake and Corliss and did well at all of them. Ask Paul and he will tell you what is hot. Let me know if you have any questions. Fish On! Hooks"
