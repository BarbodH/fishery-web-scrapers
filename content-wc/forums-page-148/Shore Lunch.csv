6226236,mjayn,2018-07-26 11:03:00,1188,"My grandfather ate bacon every morning until he was in his 50s and still ate it occasionally after that. My grandmother used bacon grease constantly to cook everything else. He lived to 90. and was in good health until the last few months when his marrow stopped producing red blood cells. I had a problem with my heart rhythm and got switched between 3 cardiologists at a top 10 cardio hospital in the US. I was eating only vegetable oil, mostly peanut and canola. All three cardiologist said most vegetable oils were far worse then any animal fat and caused inflammation on many levels. Olive oil, Saturated fats and especially medium chain fats(coconut oil) were the best. Check it out, don't take my word for it. Its tough changing thought process after me and my cousins spend decades yelling at my grampa to stop the bacon grease all those years ago. He knew better."
6226778,Aspencreek,2018-07-27 21:39:00,2911,"Typical farm breakfast and grandma and grandpa's farm. Big plate of bacon, eggs fried in bacon grease, donuts fried in same bacon grease then rolled in a bowl of sugar, sugar for the coffee that would remove rust from tools, and a glass of orange juice because it was good for you. Oh, and the milk came right from the bulk tank in the milk house, and by the time I made it back to the house with the pitcher it had started to separate and grandma would skim off the top for whip cream. For lunch, sandwiches made from home made bread with Lard with, head cheese, liver sausage, blood sausage or tongue and a stiff full grain mustard. Nothing from that cow was wasted. Most cardiologists and nutritionists would have a ""grabber"" just thinking about it, both made it into their 90's. I miss them terribly."
6226804,pjshorthorn,2018-07-28 06:24:00,5654,"Boy, did your post ever remind me of my summers spent with my grandparents in Mauston,WI. Oh ,and the homemade pies where the crust was specifically made with Tenderflake Lard from Canada. They were the best ever!!!! I occasionally cook fish in Tenderflake......that is if the wife will give up some of her pie crust lard stash. It does a nice job and the fish does not come out too greasy. PjShorthorn"
6226832,jimirjr,2018-07-28 07:32:00,1149,"I still utilize LARD when I make My pies....Oh Yeah, I ALSO add 2 TB of BACON FAT to the flour....Makes a GREAT CRUST for APPLE and Rhubarb pies !!AND... maybe once or twice a year I use 50% lard and 50% peanut oil to fry fish..."
6226852,pjshorthorn,2018-07-28 08:13:00,5654,Oh my goodness.....rhubarb pies. I'll email you a receipe for strawberry rhubarb pie that came from my grandmother. Another favorite !!!!! PjShorthorn
6224984,Guest,2018-07-23 09:58:00,0,Gentlemen Peanut oil greases my skids a little too much. What type of oil do you guys use for frying fish. Is there any alternative to peanut oil or does everything else have too low of a smoke point. Do you throw the who fish in the oil or just the filets?
6225004,The tank,2018-07-23 10:31:00,340,Canola oil
6225008,lawson2343,2018-07-23 10:40:00,459,X2. We've tried many oils and our favorite is Canola.
6225060,bigwalleye1,2018-07-23 12:13:00,2632,"For a single use, one and done, dump it in the woods after shore lunch, I use crisco shortening. Doesn't leak in the boat. Cheap. High enough smoke point for frying fish. I've gotten to the point where i can heat it, and adjust flame based on the way a few drops of water sizzle in the oil. In a cast iron dutch oven, I can keep dropping breaded fillets in til the pan is full without any noticeable temp loss, but that's the cast, not the oil.In the cabin, frying in a pan on the stove, canola or peanut oil."
6225128,mjayn,2018-07-23 14:24:00,1188,"Lard works great, high smoke point, tastes better and is alot healthier then those vegetable oils."
6225148,Stringbean,2018-07-23 14:55:00,279,Canola oil here. I don't need any more clogged arteries.
6225268,btyreprich,2018-07-23 21:09:00,1067,"When out on the lake and it's time for shorelunch, vegetable shortening is our go to item. Use it once and dump the shortening into the fire when you are done cooking fish. O mess in the boat and it tatstss great!"
6225442,Lake Wisconsin,2018-07-24 12:48:00,1960,"Another option, and healthier, is use a very good non-stick pan, and just a table spoon or so of olive oil. You are not deep frying, but pan frying. Not good if you also do fries, but IMHO, taste better, healthier and don't have to dispose of any oil."
6225770,outdoorsron,2018-07-25 10:20:00,843,Hello ogoki: I find it hard to believe that cooking with bacon grease in Canada for a week a year would cause any ill effects. Just my opinion. For something different we would wrap fillets in foil with butter and any other spices you like. Cook on the bbq. grill for 10 to 15 minutes. Good Luck . O - R
