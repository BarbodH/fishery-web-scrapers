6222994,Low4fish,2018-07-18 14:25:00,37,In reference to this recent article where a visiting fisherman was charged $1500 for importing hidden minnows into Canada. That's a hefty price to pay for 35$ worth of minnows. https://www.kenoraonline.com/local/i...leads-to-fines We have lots of good bait shops that can help out with your needs.

6223068,That Minnesota guy,2018-07-18 17:49:00,8293,Just shows that athletes who smoke dope a day before their drug test aren't the only idiots in the world. Guy from Minnesota............hope he gets banned from fishing Canada for life. Found in a hidden compartment indicates he knew the law and was willing to break it. Glad they got 'em.
6223086,martinbns,2018-07-18 18:22:00,1520,"I will never understand why we don't ban people with violations like that for life. That guy that went home with hundreds of Walleye last year to Michigan only got three years. I watched an interview with a US immigration lawyer from the US the other day, apparently since pot is about to become legal in Canada US Customs has started asking Canadians if they have ever smoked cannabis. Even answering sure when I was young results in a lifetime ban on entry to the US. His advice was to lie to US customs."

6223146,martinbns,2018-07-18 20:29:00,1520,"Wow, we were there on Friday/Saturday and Sunshine Baits had lots. They have the best live bait in Kenora IMHO."
6223186,Obabikon,2018-07-19 04:41:00,2370,"They had none in Ft. Francis... almost nothing in Morson. The dealers were selling them by the dozen, but they didn't have enough to sell to resorts."

6224962,ChuckD,2018-07-23 09:22:00,1581,Just returned from fishing Ontario for 8 days. Never had any live bait. Salted minnows in a bag worked fantastic. For the first time in a long time we found frozen minnows at a bait shop; mixture of fatheads and rainbow minnows. They didn't hold a candle to any kind of silver shiner looking minnow.Many walleyes caught with just a jig and mister twister. There are Lunkerbaits plastics that work fantastic too.I experimented with jigging raps and caught the largest fish of the trip. There are oodles of options to avoid dealing with live bait and catch plenty.
