We focused our walleye fishing early in the week towards near-shore structure in the 14-18 fow range. We were mostly catching 14-18 ""eater"" size walleyes.As the week progressed, we noticed that fish were showing up in good numbers and size on off-shore rock humps. We found our best walleye fishing at the end of the week was in 25+ fow. These locations and depths were showing many walleyes in the 18-22 inch range. Overall, our best depth for most of the week was 18-23 fow.Jigs with any type of ""bait"" worked great - leeches, crawlers, or frozen minnows. The most consistent producing jig colors were gold glitter, chartreuse glitter and blue glitter.We encountered several days with much-needed rain. A severe thunderstorm chased us off the lakes on Wednesday afternoon. After the storms departed, very high winds (30-50 mph) confined us to hiding in bays and behind islands on Wednesday evening and most of Thursday. The surface temperature of Kirkness Lake fell from 71 degrees F. to 67 degrees F. while were there. Despite the adverse weather, my wife and I boated about 700 walleyes from Saturday afternoon through Thursday evening.Pike were found casting the edges of weeds along shore, as well as fishing the off-shore rock humps. Nice pike were caught casting weed edges with bucktails and spoons. My wife caught her ""personal best"" pike this way. Nice pike were also caught on jigs+bait by off-shore rock humps. I boated a heavy 39 inch pike on a jig+minnow in this manner, from 28 fow.Overall, I rated the walleye and northern pike fishing as being ""normal"" for this point in the season. The fish were clearly establishing themselves in summer patterns.David and Linda Becker, and their entire staff (Kenny, Dawn, Mike the Guide, and Kendra) were terrific hosts. My wife and I are already looking forward to our next trip to Stormer and Kirkness Lakes.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

Last year we found some small pieces of structure that were not on the map and jigged up fish for hours. I will let you know how we did.

Our numbers and sizes of walleyes matched up with BTF's previous report except the fish slid down a bit deeper to 22-28 fow. The jig presentation was the main ticket. Jig color did not matter as we tried black, chartreuse, red, white all were effective. Also experimented with bait vs plastics on jig. I fished some plastics and had no trouble keeping up with my brother fishing bait and in fact out fished him for periods. Jigs with bait are definitely the easier way to catch fish. Kirkness is a tremendous walleye lake for numbers of 15""-22"" fish. An amazing experience."

The walleye fishing was exceptional as usual, with 11 triples the first day. We didn't bother trying to count fish after that. Frozen minnows were the go to bait, but Gulp and even Jigging Raps had their moments. Fish were very tight to structure in 18-25 FOW on calm days and scattered over the tops of reefs as shallow as 3 FOW when the wind kicked up. We could actually sight fish for wallyes in shallow rocks while trying to bass fish. Picked up a alot of fish in the reeds and cabbage while pike fishing with large spinner baits and spoons. Jigs from 1/16th to 3/16th in all colors worked. The bites were agressive most days and we could keep the jig moving pretty fast. After a cold front moved through the bite was a little tenative, but with light jigs and a stinger hook just hammered them. We didn't do any trolling with spinners or crankbaits. I doubt I will even bring that gear up next year. The pike were very active on the reefs as well as the deep cabbage. Pretty much every weed bed gave up a few pike but the bigger fish were out on the rocks. The smallmouth we caught were all in areas that had a sandy bottom but others did well on rocky points. There were times we would have a school of bass under the boat but could not get a bite. During the week I went from fishing in shorts to wearing every piece of clothing I packed with out any change in the action. There were some evenings where the fishing left all of us speechless. I think Dave and Kenny got tired of me saying"" this was the best day I have ever had fishing"" every night at the dock. Crazy amount of bait fish this year. Booked for 2019"
