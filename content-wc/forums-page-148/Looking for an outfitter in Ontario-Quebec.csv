My group and I are looking into taking our first fly in trip but we see a lot of choices out there in regards to lakes and accommodations. Can anyone point us in the right direction for a suitable lake with accommodations for 10-12 people? We are mostly just looking for great Walleye and Pike fishing. Also is mid to late June a good time to go? Thanks"

Another option for you on Lake St. Joseph is the Winoga Lodge outpost cabin. It sleeps 10. I doubt if it's available in June, but you can always check with them if another time slot works for you. It's a boat-in cabin rather than fly-in, but it's just as isolated and the fishing is great. http://www.winoga.com/outposts.html"
6227138,bthomas3333,2018-07-29 11:38:00,465,Hey - Can you give us an idea of your price range? Do you want to cook yourself or have a full service lodge? Define great walleye fishing? Do you want 100 walleyes a day with most being 16-23 or lower numbers and bigger fish? Same goes for pike? Size vs Quality?Mid June is generally the busiest time of the year so many guys feel this is the best time of the year to go. IMHO the fishing changes from June to Sept but you cant say one time is the 'best' time to go.B-

You fly from Thunderbay, ON into Weagamow Lake and from there it is a 10 minute float plane ride into North Caribou Lake.There are three sleeper cabins, each with 2 bedrooms, and a central kitchen facility/washrooms at the main camp. About a 5 minute walk down a path there is another cabin, fully equipped and self-sustaining, that sleeps 4-6. You could have the whole place to yourself with 12 guys. Staple foods are included in the rates as well. So you only need perishable foods, with the exception of onions and potatoes as they are provided.There are two camp attendants as well, so you don't need to worry about much.One of the best deals in Ontario IMO.A trip report from September 2017 - https://www.canadafishingguide.net/g...-caribou-lake/Some videos:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-fHVHMqhkQhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NU9c_O3xoc4https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lv7...CSW99fORzHB-XUhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQF4...xE5I21kxxa8_SAhttp://www.northcaribou.com/index.html"
