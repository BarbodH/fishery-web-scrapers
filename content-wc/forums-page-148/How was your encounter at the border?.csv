6225372,Lovetofish,2018-07-24 08:52:00,458,My wife and I crossed at IF on 7/13 about 1:45PM. Not a vehicle in front of us. Standard questions but he did ask how many salted minnows in a 1/2 gallon. Not sure I said about 24 dozen and away we went. Even had an extra bottle of wine along and he let us by with that. Crossed back at Pigeon River. Had one agent ask the standard questions and another looked through one of our coolers and that was it. Nothing mentioned about food at either crossing.

Way back around age 21 or so, coming back across Blue Water Bridge into USA, returning from a 7 day fly in, we had sampled some Canadian beer, liked it, so decided to bring some home, some booze also, no idea about duty etc. Came to the booth, lady officer asks us if we have any alcohol, answered yes, 4 cases of beer and 4 bottles of liquor. She looked at us and said ""You don't have a clue do you? No, what? Told us to go on,get out of here, but read the rules if we decide to go to Canada again. Many decades later, crossing into USA at the Soo, guard asks where I live, --Wilson, Michigan, he says, in the UP?, Yes, He says I've been all over the UP, never heard of that one. I said it is such a small town, we can't afford a town drunk, so we all have to take turns (old joke, I know), he got a big kick out of that and waved us through."

Even if we are only a case or 2 over, I am sure to let them know exactly what is in our possession. I have never been waved through with a ""have a nice trip!"".. and that is just fine by me.

Very first trip after buying my cabin. 9 trucks with at least 2 in every truck. Brand new quads, boats, trucks..... Pulling up to the Peace bridge and I'm flagged over by the ATF, American border patrol. I was first in line and everyone else in out group was lined up behind me. I had to pull into the ""garage"" and was instructed to get out. They began going thru everything in the truck and didnt like that I didnt tell them about my puppy in the back seat.Luckily my buddy had just graduated from Police academy and was wearing his shirt. He was brought inside and taken to a back room. My stuff was still being gone thru while he was gone. 15 minutes later we were all on our way. They were looking for a large amount of drugs to cross the border and we fit the bill for moving them. All of us were in our mid 20's with brand new toys.... That was definitely the ""worst"" one yet. Knock on wood.One that threw me for a loop is when I was asked what my license plate number was... I had to get out and go read it off to them. I could never wrap my head around that one but found out why last fall. The trailer sits at the right height to block the license plate so they can't read it Another time I was asked to remove my ash tray and hand it to them.... they weren't looking for cigarettes.....Sent from my SM-G955U using Tapatalk"

Every officer we have had on both sides of the border have been nothing short of awesome. We are constantly over on our alcohol allotment, and all we do is ensure we buy all the supplies (Liquor and Beer) for the entire trip on one beer store run, and have all the expenses on one itemized receipt. When they ask how far over we are, I just hand them the receipt, and go in and pay our fees! It' really quite simple. I have even had them thank us for the ease of operation. We did have one officer once ask us 2 very direct questions because of the amount of beer we were bring up...1.) is this a fishing trip, or a drinking trip2.) any chance all this beer is for this truck, and the 9 trucks behind youWe all laughed at that one, and went in a paid our duty. I made the mistake on year of trying to pay with a $100 bill... has been all twenties since I was educated that they don't accept those!!"

He was in the truck in front of me, but I had possession of it. He declared the two bottles, and they let him go. I claimed them since I had them and wanted to be honest. I didn't know he claimed them. So at the end of the day, Canada made money on our booze.So do you and your buddies tell them about the weed and handguns you likely take over every year? Thanks for the harsh and uncalled for accusation. You are a saint."

6218016,packpro,2018-07-06 10:44:00,695,"We usually time our IF/FF crossing for late Friday night to avoid the line. This year we started early to avoid driving 502 at night. Our reward was a long line to cross. We ended up over a mile in front of the toll bridge. Thought it was going to be a long wait. To our delight the line moved pretty good and it was only a 35 minute back up. Got to the window, passed in all the passports opened to the correct page. Guard was very stoic. Asked us a few standard questions, then looked at the photos and asked the youngest guy-36, what he was doing hanging out with these old guys-60's. Made us laugh and we joked that we started recruited ""younger"" to carry the gear. He laughed also. Never did ask us about beer/liquor. Told us to have a great trip and sent us on the way. We are usually over on the beer and happy to pay the duty. This year we get a free pass and we were not over since the guys flying in had other guys in other cars bring their beer over. Very easy crossing, very nice guy. Coming home the following Friday we had a 5 minute wait to get back to the US. The guard was pleasant and light hearted. Their was a delay with the car in front of us, so our agent just sat their and chatted us up for few minutes while that issue was being resolved. She then walked up and made the other agent move to the offending car to the side to let us through. They are just doing their job. Treat them with the respect they deserve and life is much easier. Not a duty expert, but this is what I have been told. Duty is the tax on the difference in price between the US price and the Canadian price. Therefore if you declare a higher price the difference is lower and therefore the duty is lower. Not sure if that is true. Just what I was told many years ago. Maybe someone else can confirm."
6218044,PRO-V16,2018-07-06 12:07:00,454,Buying liquor at the duty free only saves you U.S. tax. You will still pay duty to the Canadians.
6218074,Rondogpike,2018-07-06 13:05:00,24,A case of Blue @ the duty free is $19. The last few years they have run specials - buy 5 get 1 free. This brings the cost down to $15.85/case. Duty collected at the border is $11/case after your 1 case allowed duty free. Blue in Canada at the Beer Store is $42. So if we take in 6 cases (3 guys in the truck) it costs us $128 from the duty free vs $252 in Canada.
6218078,PRO-V16,2018-07-06 13:10:00,454,I get your point but was not adressing that in regards to buying booze in Canada.

""Yes sir"" or ""yes ma'am"" with all windows down, no sunglasses on, no radio on, clean look, and straight forward answers, no more and no less. Be organized with passports, birth certificates, and any hand written lists or notes regarding your cargo. We have always been treated well in return with no delays, knock on wood. My kids' birthdays are 2 years and 1 day apart (Aug. 18 & 19) and that always garners questions & smiles on how we handle that at home....both from the guys and the gals in uniform on both sides of the border.

Guard (looking at us in the back): Who's not an American? Dad: No one. We are all Americans. Guard: Why did you say you're not? Dad: I meant it as a joke, like we're not all-American football players. Guard: What's football got to do with it?

6217918,Bill Krejca,2018-07-06 06:56:00,6107,"Generally, I have found it best to let the guard initiate any funnies. If they start it, the rule seems to be that it is OK. If the person in the car starts it, the time spent at the border seems to be vulnerable to being extended. The best policy seems to be to answer the questions asked, and not share additional comments, sometimes which can lead to an extended time sitting(or standing inside) trying to clarify what was really meant by the aside comment. In most crossings in the last few years, the folks seem to be more friendly than in the past. Bill"

They were asking me where I bought it, how much it was (I totally lied about the price of the whiskey - it was very high end), and all. The $118 was more than what I paid for the **** in the USA! I said the whiskey was about $15 a bottle, but they were closer to $100. So I declare I spent about $100 in the USA on the **** and they charge me $118 to bring it in? I didn't dispute. I just paid it so they didn't rip everything else apart. Did I get totally raped? I don't know how duty charges work."

6217996,Huntindave,2018-07-06 09:45:00,2194,"Let me get this straight; You committed fraud/perjury by providing false information on the price of the alcohol and now you are concerned about the duty you had to pay? I be more concerned about your actions. You think they don't have pricing information available to them on their computers? Do you honestly think the agents didn't know you were telling them a bold faced lie? You are fortunate they didn't deny you entry and send you back home. I suspect giving false information could even land you in a holding cell overnight until you could arrange bail the next day.

6217998,Stringbean,2018-07-06 09:56:00,279,"Years ago, I crossed the border on our way to the favorite fishing hole. Ahead of us was a pickup pulling a cargo trailer. They were instructed to pull over under the canopy. For some odd reason, we were also told to pull over under the canopy. We parked right next to the cargo trailer. Now it comes time to open the locked trailer. Each one of the guys was arguing over who had the key for the padlock on the trailer. Mr. Border Agent brings out a bolt cutter the size of which I have never seen. I worked in a foundry and we had bolt cutters. The size of this cutter topped anything we had. He just squeezed the handle and bing, there goes the padlock. They had quite a bit of equipment for the spring bear hunt in there, nothing illegal. It's just that the agent wanted to check the trailer. I overheard one of the guys talking about stopping at Canadian Tire to replace the lock. Oh well."

For the past nearly 20 years, we have been crossing at Pigeon River just south of Thunder Bay. It has been an interesting change. Agents seem to be lower key, pleasant typically, and of course, some are very business like, which is fine. I chalk a lot of it up to the very busy IF and the slower paced PR. Going back into the States a few years back, the agent told me to stay in the vehicle and walked out of his office. He looked under my vehicle with a mirror, then asked me to open the back of my 4 Runner. I turned around to see what he was doing, and he said, ""No problem. Just wanted an excuse to pet your Brittany.""Welcome back to the USA!"

On this particular occasion he asked me if I had any fruit on board and I pointed to Doc and said just him.

While we were in Fort Frances my mother found a set of dishes she liked. We bought 8 place settings and each was packaged individually and each package was below the dollar limit for an individual to import. At the time I was probably 4 or 5 years old. When we crossed the border my dad described what we had purchased in Canada and told the officer we had each purchased a place setting of dishes. According to the story (because I really don't remember) the officer looked at me and asked ""Did you buy a set of dishes?"". I responded ""No! My dad bought them all!"" We were waved through the crossing. (Those ""Butter Cup"" dishes are still in use at the family cabin. I wish I had that ""Woody Wagon"".)"
