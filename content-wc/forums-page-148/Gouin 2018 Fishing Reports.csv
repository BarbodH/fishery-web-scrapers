6216650,ma1819,2018-07-03 08:21:00,13,"Kirk - Our group came in right after your group at Saarana East with Air Tamarac. Thanks for your recommendations when we arrived. Our report: Our group of six fisherman caught 600+ walleyes and 275+ pike in the week 6/24 to 6/30. It was sunny and hot the whole week, so not the best for fishing but we did well - the water temp went from mid 60's to 72-74 during the week, so fish started moving into the deeper water/main lake. Our routine was fishing early in the morning, late breakfast, fish again until 2 pm then rest mid-day. Have an early dinner the fish all evening. It was a full moon week, so we could fish late into the night. Walleye were spread out, and we found schools of fish only a coupe of times. For us, the overall size of the walleye was the best it had been in our five trips. Everyone in our group caught walleye over 22"", with the tops being a 26.5"", two at 24"", two at 23"" and many between 20' and 22"" - probably released 40+ walleye over 20"". Average fish was between 14' and 16"". We jigged and trolled. We had more consistant fishing trolling rattle traps, thin fins or rapalas, but when we found fish, jigging was good - white grub tail tipped with a crawler was the ticket. We found lots of pike, many between 30"" and 33"", largest 38"". We could catch as many pike as we wanted between 18"" and 28"", and they became more a hinderance for us walleye fisherman. As always, Air Tamarac is top notch and their service was excellent. Overall, a very successful trip"
6216860,Freytown,2018-07-03 14:55:00,770,Thank you guys for all the Gouin reports and it seems most have had a great fishing experience. Some years you can find them fast and others you need to search. Once you have learned an area you can find them somewhere.The Gouin is such a big area it would take a lifetime to explore all it's bays and coves. I can't wait for next spring to get here. FT
6218534,tweedrules,2018-07-08 07:53:00,107,"Just got back from Air Mont-Laurier (Lac Du Male). This was our 12 year on the Gouin and 8th year at Lac Du Male. As usual Norman and his staff, especially Danielle and Louise at the camp were AWESOME. Camp is in tip top shape. They built a new fish house which is great. Weather was crazy. It was like 90 degrees on Tuesday and Wednesday and like 50 on Thursday. I had a winter hat on no ****. The lake is 4 feet down from the last 2 years. It seems, according to the regulars, back to ""normal"" level. The weed beds we were used to were gone. We had a hard time finding cover to flip spoons. We don't count fish like other groups but we limited out on walleye. 56 fish brought home and also ate fish for two meals so lot of walleye caught. All caught in 20 feet of water jigging or 10-15 feet of water trolling. It didn't matter how we jigged. All caught fish. Charturse, yellow, white, pink; all colors worked. With plastics or without all caught fish. One constant was leeches and worms were needed in all cases. Trolling we used thin fins and hot n tots. We caught lots of little pike. Not much size. Biggest fish was 38inches. Biggest walleye was 7lbs and yes we released it. 364 days until next year. Already making a new list. PM me if you have any questions."

6201176,Buckmaster6532,2018-05-28 18:48:00,8,A thread to keep everyone informed on the catch and conditions.
6201270,tweedrules,2018-05-29 05:25:00,107,Thanks for setting this up.
6208348,Buckmaster6532,2018-06-13 10:18:00,8,We scheduled a 2 week fishing trip to the Gouin from June 2 to June 16 but we came home after 6 days. The water was very low and going down making the fishing terrible.
6208453,tweedrules,2018-06-13 16:05:00,107,Have you ever been to the Gouin before? Where did you go this year? We have been there for 12 years. We have had 6 feet over regular water levels and 6 feet below where the docks were unusable. Never heard of fishing being that bad from anyone. Varies from year to year but we never wanted to leave. Sorry you had a tough trip. Hope your next trip is a better one.
6208581,Buckmaster6532,2018-06-14 07:03:00,8,We fished the North Bay of the Gouin this year and last year. The water was high last year and the fishing was great. This year with the low water no one in our camp was catching fish. I have been to Quebec and Ontario on both fly-in and drive to lakes about 20 times and this was by far the worst ever.
6208860,Freytown,2018-06-15 05:33:00,770,"I just returned from a week at the Gouin the fishing was fine. Water is down aprox 4 feet from high mark. IMO, the post spawn period is later this spring due to late ice out and fish slowing returning from spawning areas. Strong north winds keep me around camp for two days also.I did catch a lot of small walleye but some really nice ones in the mix. Overall the fishing was good....maybe not great, but surely not lousy? FT"
6208968,ma1819,2018-06-15 09:54:00,13,"Thanks for the updates- Freytown - what area of the Gouin did you fish? Our group of 6 is headed to Saarana Bay in a week. Any pike around? Did you jig or troll for walleye? Thanks, any info would be appreciated -"
6209050,Freytown,2018-06-15 13:53:00,770,Caught a few npike but nothing big....I don't fish for them though. Most of my walleye were caught trolling the original floating rapala #11 on a bottom bouncer (18-20ft). Nothing shallow as would be normal for spring. Jigging worked too but I couldn't find a concentration of fish yet. Water range between 50F to 56F at surface. I think you will being hitting at perfect good time as everything was behind schedule. I fished South Bay (Baie du Sud at Pointe aux Dore)FT
6209986,ma1819,2018-06-18 09:35:00,13,Freytown - Merci - will submit a report when we return
6214088,kegisfly,2018-06-27 07:54:00,22,"Our group of 4 fished Saraana East with Air Tamarac from 6/19 till 6/23/18. We had the best walleye fishing in 7 trips to the Gouin. We also had the worst pike fishing in 7 trips. The reservoir was down about 3 feet and rising slowly. The surface water temp was between 62 & 67 depending on the device and the location. As for walleye, they were late and still transitioning out to the main lake areas. We were catching them in everything from 25 to 3 feet of water. We mostly jigged for walleye. We caught fish of all sizes, with a few 22"" walleye being the max. We caught plenty in the upper end of the slot. Pike were tough. We caught a few larger pike while jigging. The largest was 38."" We enjoy spending time casting for pike, but, it was not very productive in numbers or size. The largest caught casting was in the mid 20's and we did not stir up and miss anything that was much larger than that. There was little or no grass in the traditional grass beds (most likely due to the reservoir being down?). We tried some casting at windblown shores and caught nothing. The weather was incredible and their were only brief rain showers on a couple of days. Temps ranged from the mid 30's to the mid 70's. Winds were moderate (for the Gouin), however, there were periods on a couple of days where there was almost no wind. We did not have to go to the main lake to find fish, so, this may influence my perspective on the wind. Good Fishing, Kirk"
