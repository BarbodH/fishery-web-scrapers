6224872,Juls,2018-07-23 00:42:00,13414,"They smell of wintergreen. That's why I thought it was crazy when I first heard of it, but I tried it and was surprised to see how well it worked."

6226612,Guest,2018-07-27 12:34:00,0,"Agree! I've never understood why people mess with live bait on remote lakes. Me and 3 buddies caught over 1,200 walleyes (fishing 8 hrs/day) last month using nothing but white or black 5"" Kalins. Worst case scenario, if the bite is really soft, tip the jig/twister with a piece of frozen minnow."
6224396,Guest,2018-07-21 13:43:00,0,"Hi everyone. Just wish to pick everyone noggin! We are going to a fly in outpost out of Sioux Lookout in late August. We did the same last year but had a **** of a time keeping the minnow alive and last till day 4. We brought 50 dozen in with us when we flew in. The boats were supplied with Fabrill trolling buckets, which work great. L the outfitter supplied a large 5 gal bucket with many holes for keeping the remaining minnows, tied to the dock. By day 4, most of the remaining to dead and mushy. I dont mind using the dead ones, they catch walleye too Could anyone suggest an idea or product or home made contraption that would help keep the lil buggers alive longer. thanks for the help"
6224440,eyemike,2018-07-21 16:33:00,233,Put a large rock in the bucket and sink indeeper water where it is colder.
6224474,Pooch,2018-07-21 18:14:00,4618,"Agree^^^BUT, three years ago the water temps were hot and in the bay that the docks were located water was hot top to bottom (six foot deep) and nearly stagnant. We lost most all of our minnows after day two. Pricey lesson.Still there are few other options. If it were possible and secure under the same conditions I might consider using the perforated buckets and stash our minnows in deeper open water with a marker buoy on them. Would have to be on a remote lake though or some jerk would steal them.Pooch"
6224502,bthomas3333,2018-07-21 19:48:00,465,Cold clean water is the key. We used to make ice cubes and throw them in the minnow buckets. After the minnows die (we'd check them am and pm) we have had some luck with putting them in plastic bags and freezing them a dozen or so at a time. Then take them out to fish frozen. Not ideal but it keeps them from getting too soft.B-
6224522,h8go4s,2018-07-21 21:09:00,1673,"It's been many years since I did a fly-in trip, but we never bothered with live minnows. Buy a couple gallons of fatheads, throw them on the driveway, scatter salt on them, bag them in ziplocks and freeze them. Fly-in lakes are so full of hungry fish, they'll nail them."
6224530,x4flatfish,2018-07-21 21:31:00,319,Forget the minnows...use crawlers or leeches
6224532,chris.brock,2018-07-21 21:37:00,112,"I don't think there's any need for minnows flying into that neck of the woods, plastic works fine"
6224542,adempsey2.0,2018-07-21 22:16:00,611,"Well, if the ventilated 5G pail can't get to cool enough water, I would just bring a marker buoy, attach it to the 5G pail and sink it down as soon as you locate 12-15 feet or so out from the dock. Wouldn't be too much trouble to visit it on your way out each morning. Not sure what else you can do."
6224556,Juls,2018-07-22 03:28:00,13414,"Since you don't mind using dead ones.... There's a trick we do here on Erie, to save leftover shiners for perch fishing, but walleye like it too, so you might want to try this. No guarantee that northern fish will like it, but all I know is that these fish do. Buy Wintergreen rubbing alcohol from your local pharm.(It runs .88 cents a bottle at Wally World.) Remove the minnows from the water, and cover them with the alcohol...then, freeze. Keep frozen until you use them. Put enough minnows in each container to use for one day's trip. The alcohol never completely freezes, so it doesn't take long to thaw them, and it keeps the minnows FIRM after they thaw out instead of mushy, like salted ones are. Anyway...it's an idea, and you don't have to stress over keeping them alive all week."
6224724,Pooch,2018-07-22 14:43:00,4618,I've never heard of doing that. Do the minnows smell of the alcohol when used? Or does it dissipate quickly?Pooch
