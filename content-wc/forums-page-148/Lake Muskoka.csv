6223856,steve.a,2018-07-20 10:05:00,274,I have never been to this part of Ontario and I am going to try Lake Muskoka the middle of September. Does anyone have a heads up on it? Taking the wife there and it is going to be a part fishing part boating type of trip. I have been to LOTW in the fall several times and know this will be very different. Any advice about the lake will be welcome. Thanks
6224856,chris.brock,2018-07-22 21:40:00,112,"yes, it will be quite different than LOTW, there is lots of million dollar cottages cramming the shorelines, it shouldn't be too busy in September, the good thing is most of the wealthy cottagers don't fish seriously, there is big fish in the lake but it won't be as easy as LOTW"
6224858,Lake Of The Woods,2018-07-22 21:50:00,124,"Ah yes, Lake Muskoka,... beautiful that time of year as the fall colours are spectacular indeed. However, being that it is relatively close to Toronto it seems everyone and his/her extended family goes there to vacation. Compared to the Lake Of The Woods area you will find Muskoka very highly populated. Now, I have not fished that area in many years but I do remember thinking to myself compared to LOTW that the fishing was slow and did not compare very good to Northwestern Ontario. Muskoka gets hit hard every summer and all summer long. But like I say, I have not fished that area in quite a while so perhaps others who have a more recent timeline of angling in Lake Muskoka can chime in. I would also be interested in hearing how the fishery in hanging in there with all the pressure put upon it."

You can access lake Rousseau and lake Joseph, two large lakes with lake trout as the main fish. Gorgeous area and millionaire rows of cottages and boathouses. There are some midlake humps and rock piles...walleye and bass fishing good as well as typical rocky points. But don't expect steady fishing nor a remote experience."
