6011145,tadler,2018-02-18 19:01:00,43,We just booked the opening week at WRC. First time at that camp although we have many years of Canadian fishing. Target mostly eyes and northerns. Any thoughts on fishing that time of year. Thanks.
6011169,HeHooksHimself,2018-02-18 19:39:00,725,"we have stayed with Moss and Debbie four times, most recently last September at the outpost. Spring will be very productive and you will catch plenty of eyes close to camp. However, make sure you take some time to explore the chain, it is pretty awesome. Also, Moss offers lots of portage opportunities for some solitude. Snakeweed will be hot that early and Narrow Lake is special. You also might pick up a laker or two while you troll or cast for northerns bonus!. I caught a 40 inch pike in Big Woman a few years ago. We found Shanty Bay in Big Woman very productive for the opener. The system will be busy now that Canada North is back in operation but there is a lot of water. Minnows and chartreuse jigheads work well for walleyes but one year electric chicken plastics were deadly. Moss keeps his stuff in good repair and his cabins are well maintained. The price he gives is the price he gets, no surprises. You will have a great time. Be sure to give a report on you return! Fish ON! Hooks"

Everything else is shallow too, but we catch all species in that magic 4-40. Look for incoming water, creeks, rapids, etc. Those areas should be producing. If they aren't there, look deeper. Always start shallow and work your way out. Bring both types of clothing, winter and summer. Chances are you will be wearing both throughout the week. Sunburn one day. Snow the next."
6023209,tadler,2018-02-24 09:45:00,43,Thanks for the info Hooks. Hoping its a bit less crowded for the opener. OK you got me. Haven't heard of electric chicken plastics. Who makes them?
6023393,HeHooksHimself,2018-02-24 11:15:00,725,"electric chicken is a color combo. the colors are pink and neon green. We use walleye assassins with the the curly tail. 4"" The regular shad assassins with the curly tail are our go to plastic. If the bite is slow, you might find the walleye just hang on to the tail, in which case you could use the paddle tail.https://bassassassin.com/colors/c-376/ Good luck! FISH ON! Hooks"

There are very few inlets or creeks into the system by the camp but there is current at points and narrows. If you see a guy fishin with a german short haired pointer that would be me,stop and ask for help or fishing spots if you need it . I have fished the system for seven years now. Canada about 40 years.mike"
