Not really interested in staying at Onaman River resort as the boat ride is long and we would like to be able to wake up and wet a line right away. Any insight on where we could park the truck and trailers, put the boats in, etc is all appreciated. I know a lot of people like to keep tight lips about Nipigon camping areas, so PMs welcome as well. Thanks!"

They had a few canvas tents with all the necessary equipment already in site. Not sure if they still offer this but it was featured on a tv show a few years back and your right it looked world class for sure.
