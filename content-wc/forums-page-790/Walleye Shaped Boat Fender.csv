543082,NEWMARGUY,2004-08-30 12:39:00,34,"Has anyone ever seen a ""rubber"" very lifelike looking boat fender shaped and painted like a large Walleye. It was mfg by ""Dock's Edge Mfg. Inc."" and sold by ""Lunkers"" in Michigan. ""Lunkers"" contacted and they don't know where the item came from and they have not carried it for some time. I can't find ""Dock's Edge Mfg. Inc."" and Cabelas, Bass Pro have been no help. Anyone who has any info that may help please post a reply. Thanks, Andy"
