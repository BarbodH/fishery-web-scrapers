We are looking for a drive-in lake with good walleye fishing (either lodge or outpost) within a 12 hour drive of Cleveland, Ohio. Prefer eastern Ontario or western Quebec. Please help!"

543044,Guest,2004-08-29 06:55:00,0,"I would suggest you look at happy day lodge near chapleau, ont. I think it would be all of 14 hours since you would have to go through detroit to get there.... i have fished there two times and both time there were plenty of walleyes to be had. the first trip was my first walleye fishing EVER, and starting the second day we got a limit every day. this year we nailed the eye's with one day of 50+ for me and another of 40 or so. our 4 man group took home a limit of walleye and enough whitefish filets to fill a 40 quart cooler. we also have caught many smallmouth and some pike. their website is www.happydaylodge.com the owners are in their second year there and have done a nice job of keeping the good things about the camp, improving some things that needed it and they bring a great energy and personality to the place. i made a reservation before i left. the drive in is all good road until the last 16 miles or so, which is a dirt road to the camp that is well maintained (we drove it at about 35 mph towing our camper). the lake is large and the only boats you are likely to see are from the camp which is the only one on the lake. their rental boats are 14' sylvans with swivel seats and new 18 hp mercs every spring. get in touch if you need some more info. jerry"
