543107,Guest,2004-08-31 14:42:00,0,"Four of us fished there this year the last week of June. We caught over 700 Walleye with the two biggest being 31 1/2"" and 30"". We never ran farther than 20 minutes from camp and caught a lot of fish whithin 10 minutes of camp. The owners are very helpful and will tell you where to catch fish. We had our wives with us and only fished about six hours a day."
543109,Guest,2004-08-31 15:24:00,0,what camp. May I e-mail you?or you me [email protected]
543115,Guest,2004-09-01 05:51:00,0,Wait just a minute Mike in Kansas backup the walleye train. Last week you said you caught 600 walleye. Sounds kind of fishy to me
543117,Guest,2004-09-01 07:59:00,0,My typing is like my age....old and weak. 600 is the right number...thanks for helping an old man correct a mistake.
543119,Guest,2004-09-01 12:39:00,0,"IADAVE, I have fished with Mike many times and while he has to take his shoes off to count and he types with two fingers he can smell out a good Walleye spot like nobody I have ever fished with. Mike knows not only how to find them and what they will hit on but he puts the people in his boat on Big Walleye. The group he fishs with call him ""Grand Master"" because he has coverted all of them from Pike fishing to Hanging Hog Walleye. So cut him a little slack and hope that someday you have the privilege and honor of sitting in his boat and watching the Grand Master make your dreams come true."
543120,Guest,2004-09-01 12:43:00,0,"Daveinmo, We dont recognize Mo has a state so I called you IADAVE. Kind of an upgrade from Mo to Iowa."
543122,Guest,2004-09-01 13:10:00,0,"Now that I have all of your attention, do you guys at least agree with his lodge choice???"
543123,Guest,2004-09-01 13:26:00,0,Go for it novice. I fished with the Grand Master at Evergreen and it was the first time I ever Walleye fished....Im hooked now. Its a very nice place and good fishing is close.
543124,Guest,2004-09-01 14:01:00,0,When are you planning on going? They tend to book up with repeat business. Better give them a call ASAP
543126,Guest,2004-09-01 15:11:00,0,We booked last November to get our June date. If I were you I would book ASAP.....Good Luck
543016,Guest,2004-08-27 19:47:00,0,I am planning on going to Lac Seul Next year. What lodge would you guys recommend. I am looking for good cabins as well as good boats. I am not into roughing it anymore.
543026,Guest,2004-08-28 10:59:00,0,Hello. From what I have read of the lodges what you are looking at is probably a $1000 or more for american plan type lodging and another $1000 a week for a fancy guide type cruiser boat. I have seen a couple of place on LOW. I dont remember the name but they call them the 3 jewels of the north around sioux narrows. On lac saul I dont think I remember seeing any really fancy places yet. its too far north. Good luck.
543027,Guest,2004-08-28 11:18:00,0,"Walleye Novice, There are higher-end lodges on Lac Seul, which may well cater to your needs. I don't know how fancy you're looking for, but Silver Water Wheel Lodge (SWWL) has insulated, carpeted cabins, with wood heat, fridges, and running hot water, and breakfast and dinner served in the main lodge. On the water, it's a fleet of Lund 1800 Series Tournament Pro-V boats, powered by 80-100 Hp Yamaha 4-Stroke engines, and guides that will do everything but set the hook for you if you so desire, including the daily preparation of shorelunch. You should check it out if it sounds for you. Bookings are always very tight, but you may be able to get an early or late season date, or get in on a cancellation."
543055,Guest,2004-08-29 19:32:00,0,Evergreen Lodge is fantastic. Great boats 17 ft Alumicrats 40 hp merc's new ever 3 years. Pat and Gray know what fishermen want and do a great job of providing it.
543057,WCoyote,2004-08-29 19:59:00,200,"Anderson's just south of Sioux Lookout is also very good. Good cabins, good food and good guides."
543066,Guest,2004-08-30 01:53:00,0,"Golden Eagle Resort, Ear Falls, great boats & motors, gracious hosts, cleanest cabins around. Alma and Scott also have some of the best prices around."
543094,Guest,2004-08-31 07:41:00,0,"Sorry, I did not specify Housekeeping Plans...We like to pretend we are the Flinstones and cook brontasaurus size steaks several times. Complete carnivore week. No balance in the diet. Can't do that if we do American Plan. Only veggie we need to eat are beans for every meal, and onions. Are the cabins at Evergreen nice, or just adequate. Looking for an August trip. Anyone know anything about Lac Seul Lodge? Looks nice on the website, but the pictures could have been taken years ago."
543097,Guest,2004-08-31 08:59:00,0,Most of the cabins at Evergreen are new 5 years old or less They have one that will house 14. I think they are excellant and the fish cleaning house is one of the nicest I've used and it get plenty of use. Check their website on justfishontario.com They have several differnt packages. Gas grills for your steaks.
543099,Guest,2004-08-31 10:03:00,0,"I have fished SWWL, Evergreen and Lac Seul Lodge. Sounds to me like Evergreen is your best bet. Cabins are like new and fishing is solid boats are top notch.. Clean camp and great hosts. Great place to cook your own meals and enjoy a very friendly camp."
543106,Guest,2004-08-31 14:14:00,0,Do you have to go far from Evergreen for fish. I have heard about hour rides to the hot spots. That is one reason for not going to Lac Seul.
