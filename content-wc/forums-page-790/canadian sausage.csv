542957,Guest,2004-08-26 04:16:00,0,"Correction: Quebec, which is still in Canada, sells beer in supermarkets. Regarding the other issues raised in this post...I think that there is a language problem. You know how, in Ontario, walleye are referred to as ""pickerel""? Well, horsemeat is referred to as ""pork"" and sawdust is referred to as ""cornmeal"" and a typical breakfast is referred to as ""friecakes"" and lunch is referred to as ""Blue"" and the phrase ""Have you totally grasped the meaning of that which I've been talking about?"" is, in Canada, referred to as ""Eh?"" as in ""It's lunchtime, let's go for some Blue, eh?"""
542965,Guest,2004-08-26 08:38:00,0,Man..... some of the best sausage I have ever eaten was purchased in farm towns in Saskatchewan that still have butcher shops. Many different kinds of sausage. Yum!
542984,Guest,2004-08-26 17:02:00,0,We sell meat in kilos not lbs.There is 2.2 lbs in a kilo. The meat was priced right. As far as the pork goes you might have got a bad batch or it spoiled for whatever reason. I prefer the tenderloins to the sausage. I just bought on sale for $6.00Can per lb.
542985,Guest,2004-08-26 17:04:00,0,Winkler Pork Sausage and Mennonite sausage is to die for. Not available in other locations but western Canada. Those people know how to both work and eat.
543021,rebelrn2001,2004-08-27 22:24:00,1563,Eggs look/taste a bit different in Canada too. I am told it is beause they only feed the chickens ?corn?. Beef might be the same way too.
543032,Guest,2004-08-28 13:55:00,0,"that a tourist visits a foreign country and subjectively compares everything they see and do to the way things are back home, while a traveler lives in the moment in the new country, experiencing their ways, their customs, their mores, their food."
543039,Guest,2004-08-28 18:06:00,0,"Not all of Canada is that over priced! I was in the Lake of the Woods area a couple of summers ago and almost cried every time I needed to buy something. I couldn't understand how tackle prices were twice as high as here. If you want a great fishing trip with low prices and few fishermen, come out west to Saskatchewan!"
543047,chrism,2004-08-29 09:14:00,429,"Correct most beef and chicken is grain fed, wheras in the US I believe corn/grain mix is used. Corn gives eggyolks an orange color, and grain gives them a yellow color. Same with the fat on certain animals - there may be a color variance. As for taste, I can tell the diff between eggs, and I think in the beef - however, the steaks I have eaten that came form the US were extremely marbled (and melted in your mouth!) as compared to the same cut that I had bought in Canada. Prices are in Kilograms, so as mentioned, when converted to pounds they are not far off - As for the comments about the yucky taste - I suspect you had a bad or old or something... or perhaps stored wrong? I do agree that the safeway sausages are not very good at all!!! Best to go to a meat shop. Good point above that the same food around the world does have a unique taste to its country of origin - as it should! On that note, even food in the same country can taste vastly different - ever had a free range chicken or turkey that isn't loaded with the drugs/steroids/chemical feeds that 99.9% of our birds are?? Way different - not saying better (well, better for you!), just different. Case in point about taste - have a walleye or northern from a northern Canadian lake(i mean north, above the 53rd p, not LOTW or vicinity), and it's taste is significantly different than one pulled from a warm lake in the southern part of the provinces of states. Our money is different too - and our Taxes!!!LOL!!! chrism"
543064,Trailerguy,2004-08-29 21:50:00,1407,[font color=green size=3][b]I'll never forget the first time I had eggs in a Dryden resterant about 25 yrs ago. The yoke was grey/green and they had a strong flavor. :o The hens were eating ground alfalfa and wheat.
542919,Guest,2004-08-24 20:55:00,0,"Just got back from Ft. frances and a coule of things struck me as odd. First, why is pork sausage so different? we got some safeway brand and although we were weatheed in an extra day nobody would touch the last of 3 pounds. It was awful!!!! Prices on thwe whole were considerably higher than back home. Hamburger-7.50/lb and a sirloin at 15.99!!! Are the wages that much better in Canada? !5% sales tax-yowwee! 3.25 gas!! Funny thing was when we asked the safeway manager where the canned biscuits were he said they didn't keep 'em because the american tourists kept them all bought out. That seems like an odd reason not to stock them-they sell too fast!!! No corn meal as we have it here either. Just a little bag of something being pawned off as corn meal. How can a walleye fillet be served without a couple of hush puppies on the side? Minnows 3.60 a dozen here they are less than a buck/dozen. No disrespect meant but I am from a poor state and these prices would be a burden for many of my neighbors. For what it's worth I never met anyone on my trip that was anything but courteous."

First mistake...shopping at Safeway...second mistake...buying store brand...ick. I've never paid that much for hamburger but I have paid alot for Black Angus Sirloin. Gas works out to about 2.25 for a US gallon in US dollars....minnows at 3.60 is not even close to the most expensive I have seen but when you are north you pay a premium for everything. Hush puppies are not a popular snack here and again shopping at Safeway was probably why you received second rate corn meal. Glad you had fun and next time shop where the locals shop!"
542925,Guest,2004-08-25 08:13:00,0,"""Lets get ready to ruuuuummmmble"" - thats what will happen to this thread throughout the day today. Anyway, what struck me odd was that when I too was at a Safeway, looking for potatoes and a crapper, I walked the whole store three times over, and found no booze. Finally I asked a lady where the beer/booze is, and she said: ""Which one do you want?"" I said ""It didn't matter"" she said: ""Well, the beer store is around the corner on the right, and the booze store is just a little past that"" I said: ""WTF? you don't sell booze in your grocery stores?"" Well, I guess thats what happens - different countries, different cultures, different rules, different things.... Thats like me this weekend, being a WI native, I was in IL for a funeral. I was charged $8.50 for three bottles of beer and a mixed drink. I thought to myself ""I might just move to IL for these booze prices"". Then I thought to myself ""but then I'd have to hang myself"". later"
542931,Guest,2004-08-25 09:30:00,0,I'll bite where do the locals shop? They don't sell strong beer or booze in grocery stores in MN either or on Sunday. Not a big deal.
542933,bigfish1965,2004-08-25 09:57:00,3210,"They don't sell booze at any stores other than liquor stores in Canada. Beer is avilable at 'The Beer Store'. Never been a problem. Higher end groceterias in Ontario are places like Zehr's or Sobey's. Middle of the road places are A&P or Loblaws. Low end stuff at Safeway, Food Basics, No Frills, WalMart. They are all probably owned by the same corporation though."
542936,phishfearme,2004-08-25 10:40:00,1242,"woog - you can also take a trip to another ""foreign country"" that hasn't come into the 60's or 70's or 80's..... it's pennsylvania! we're alot like ontario - beer stores and liquoir store - both independent and usually no where near each other. it's a pleasure for us to travel to states where food store carry it all. - phish"
542937,Guest,2004-08-25 11:01:00,0,"Canada is not the USA. If you go to Mexico, their groceries will be different and taste different as well. This will hold true for any foreign country. I think people sometimes forget Canada is a different nation and expect everything to be just like it is in Minneapolis or Des Moines. :)"
542942,Guest,2004-08-25 12:48:00,0,Are there any higher end or middle stores in Ft Frances?
542946,Guest,2004-08-25 15:30:00,0,My point exactly - which is why traveling is so great. You get to learn something new and interesting about different people/places every day!
