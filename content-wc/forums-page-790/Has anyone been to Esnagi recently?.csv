542844,Guest,2004-08-23 10:53:00,0,Has anyone been to Esnagi Lake recently? We are planning a trip there soon and would like to know if anyone has any feedback/pointers?
542881,Guest,2004-08-24 06:57:00,0,"We were there(Mar Mac Lodge) end of July. We had great success on a simple live bait rig w/ a leech. Minnows produced too. A small colored hook w/ a bead and a 3 ft leader w/ a walking sinker above a barrel swivel did the trick. Subtlety was the key. The bear island weedbeds produced some fish, but they were scattered overall and we picked up and moved quite a bit. We caught fish in water depths of anywhere from 5-25 ft. Williams Wablers picked up almost all the nice pike, including a 20 lb class fish my 9 yr old had to the boat. Made his Dad proud. All in all a great trip. Most of our walleye were at the higher end of the 16-22 inch slot. As usual, Ken and Debbie were gracious hosts and the camp was extremely well run. Hope this helps."
542884,Guest,2004-08-24 07:28:00,0,Did you have to run up to the north end of the lake for the walleye?
542890,Guest,2004-08-24 09:17:00,0,"No, never made it to Columbus but others in camp did and brought back some fish. We did just fine south of the narrows. Typical pattern of trolling to find fish, then drifting w/ the rigs over the same area. are you staying at Mar Mac or Esnagi Lodge and how many years have you gone to Esnagi?"
542905,Guest,2004-08-24 12:26:00,0,"We are staying at MarMac. Excellent accomodations. Last year was our first year, but we will hopefully be back every year. We took a guide out last year and showed us multiple places (marked on GPS), but most were past the narrows, up in the northern end. Long ride but the scenery made it enjoyable everytime. The food at camp was great, but nothing beats a fresh shore lunch. Eyes were steady, but the bigger pike eluded us until the last day. Can't wait for more. thanks for the info...."
542911,Guest,2004-08-24 16:25:00,0,Where is this lake?
