543011,Guest,2004-08-27 14:46:00,0,"Yep, I agree! Fish are kinda like women. I use to chase those 45 year old woman, but once you get a 21 year old, gee, those old gals aren't worth even trying for anymore. Just nice young fresh meat for me!"
543013,Guest,2004-08-27 15:20:00,0,"Learn how to take the ""Y"" bones out of hammerhandles and you'll have more than enough tasty fish for your shore lunch...leave the smallies alone, muskies do a good enough job keeping their populations in check. Craig"
543043,Matches,2004-08-28 21:09:00,236,"Ontario Department of Ministry legal fish possession limits (depending where you fish): Muskie 1 with size restriction Walleye 2 per day for Americans, 4 for Residents, Small Mouth 4 per day and in possession with no size limits. Who should change their priorities??"
543060,AB,2004-08-29 21:06:00,61,"That would raise some eyebrows in the fish cleaning house - somebody bringing in one - 52inch muskie, two - 15inch walleye, and 4 - 10inch bass!!"
543069,Guest,2004-08-30 08:17:00,0,"As for the comment that frozen walleye does not taste as good as fresh, you my friend are probably wearing panties. We freeze our walleye in water and tastes better than fresh fish for months. The problem with the fresh fish a lot of times it is mushy, unless you are fishing in cold weather. Ive been eating eyes and smallies for 50 years, and let me tell you a smallmouth out of the right body of water is excellent, as a matter of fact I have 5 fillets in the fridge waiting for me tonight Peace."
543077,Guest,2004-08-30 10:49:00,0,Any debate about personal taste is pointless...I could say that roadkill possum tastes like $#*% and I guarantee five guys would tell me I'm not preparing it right and it actually tastes like pumpkin pie.
542966,Matches,2004-08-26 08:52:00,236,"Walleyes are great for eating, but with a 2 a day limit, why is it so frowned upon for keeping a couple Small Mouth? If you tell someone you kept a bass, their mouth usually falls open in disbelief. They may not taste as well, but why not for a shore lunch?"
542967,MoWalleyeguy,2004-08-26 09:23:00,409,"To me a Smallmouth is a fish to worship...why you ask? A 15"" Walleye is only about 3 years old depending on what part of the country you are in. A 15"" Smallmouth in some areas can be 12 years old or more! They are incredible fighters and one of my all time favorite fish. Back in the 1970's when we didnt know better we caught some and kept them for shore lunch. No they didnt taste great at all and now that we know how long it takes to ""grow"" one and they are not near as prolific as Walleye and other species keeping any is just not good. Try catching perch or a pike (if you can't catch a walleye) if your wanting a tasty Shore Lunch... both of them will be good eating."
542969,Guest,2004-08-26 11:23:00,0,The smallmouth taste just fine.........I personaly don't keep them but I know many that do. I think you get those looks of disbelief because they can't believe you would rather eat a smallmouth over a walleye.
542975,Guest,2004-08-26 13:03:00,0,Use the bass-0-matic and you can drink em down just like a milk shake
542978,Jignminnow,2004-08-26 13:40:00,42,"When the limit changes to two fish I will be eating everything! Muskie, Smallies, Sturgeon, carp......it all smells like fish! Jignminnow <""{{{{{< tight lines wet nets"
542992,Guest,2004-08-27 05:15:00,0,"It amuses me that fishermen who travel to catch walleye are so obsessed with bringing a limit home with them. To me, the best part of a fishing trip is the taste of FRESH walleye. We stopped bringing our limits home about twenty years ago when it occurred to us that the experience of eating frozen and thawed walleye (despite all our best efforts of preservation) was nowhere near as enjoyable as those great shore lunches of fresh-from-the-lake walleye. Having said that, the idea of frying up smallies just for the sake of eating fresh fish is absurd. First, as mentioned, these combative critters take years to grow and breeders should be saved for regeneration. Secondly, there are far more tastier fish available in any water. Thirdly, if you are actually catching walleye but saving them for the trip home, and then catching smallies for a shore lunch, you might want to rethink your priorities. I'm all for enjoying the gifts of the outdoors but we must use some common sense and try and be selective of the harvest. By the way, does anyone out there have a good recipe for musky?"
542993,Guest,2004-08-27 05:39:00,0,Many of our Northern Ontario Walleye lakes are being overrun with smallmouths. These fish are aggressive and I eat pretty much any that I catch. They taste just fine.

543006,Guest,2004-08-27 11:32:00,0,"I stopped keeping smallies and perch many years ago. Every one I caught had worms in the meat, ""nasty"". I fish in the Sioux Lookout area. From that point on I send them alll back."
543007,Guest,2004-08-27 12:11:00,0,Use the same reciepe as for bass but use the Musky-O-Matic. And the Husky Musky Matic for those 50 inch plus Musky
