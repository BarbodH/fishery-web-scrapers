543002,Todd_NE,2004-08-27 09:12:00,1330,Sounds like a good place to use Jeff's 19' Alumacraft!!! Todd Trout - they make the walleye fat!
543003,Todd_NE,2004-08-27 09:13:00,1330,"Terry, Mannnnnn I wish I could get up there. One of these years, maybe I can talk Jim Carroll into taking me! If it wasn't for darn work I could fish more... Of course, I'd have no money to travel based on recent tourney results :) Todd"
543004,Guest,2004-08-27 09:29:00,0,I am having a hard time understanding your e-mail. My thought was the portage went north (into whitefish) and south (into turtle lake/Sabaskong Bay both LOTW. Help... Thanks Tha cable snaped on August 14th. I just received word from one of the guides that it is back up working.
543005,wallidiver,2004-08-27 11:18:00,50,"Yes the portage does run north and south. I was up there the first of August and becuase of an old post I saw on walleye central I was able to help a couple of guys who were having difficulty getting there boat from Whitefish back into Turtle. The old cable was binding up on the east side of the spindle it cranks onto. Basically it was getting caught up becuase the cable was old. If they have a new cable on, there should be no problem. Good luck with your trip, the fishing around the Sabakong area was some of the best I'd seen in years."

543034,Guest,2004-08-28 15:41:00,0,"Todd, you going to Nestor ? Good fishen Rob"
543037,Ia Walihntr,2004-08-28 17:46:00,320,"Black Dog, Heading up to Hay Island Sept.18th. Please post wheather or not the mechanical portage is operating. Thanks, Marv Guess I should have read the rest of the thread first. Could have answered my own question. Wallidiver, Your post has me pretty opitistic about my chances for a great trip. Hopefully the colder weather will hold off just a bit longer. Thanks again."
543040,Guest,2004-08-28 18:26:00,0,"Ia Walihntr, We fish out of Nestor Falls, but I fish out around Hay as well. Drop me a note and I'll give you some insight on what we found the first of August. [email protected]"
543071,Todd_NE,2004-08-30 08:22:00,1330,"Rob, I thought black dog was you under an alias at first. I've tried emailing you a few times this summer and your box is always full. We'll be up around Sabaskong Bay (big area I know) this friday-sunday. Todd"

542780,Todd_NE,2004-08-20 13:42:00,1330,"Any word on how the greenback run in Manitoba is shaping up? Wonder what the water and weather opinions are. Looks like a Oct 14-17 for me this year. Looking forward to it as always! Todd No honey... Those aren't ALL my rods lures. (I have more, evil laugh)"
542786,timeout,2004-08-20 14:50:00,28,"Weather is pretty crappy, all summer, if you can call it that. Some people fishing the red are wearing survival suits already, if that tells you anything about the weather. Hard to tell how the run is going to shape up at this point. The sauger run started a couple of weeks ago, still pretty small, no real size to them. Jigging from shore about a week and a half ago I caught 1 greenback and the guy beside me caught another. Talked to another guy who said 2 had come out earlier. All these were about 16"". Have seen nothing personally since. Flow looks to be good and the shiners appear to be up also. The cats are going like crazy even with the COLD low front that moved in a few days ago. That front shut the sauger down. Caught only 8 in around 2 1/2 hours last night. A few people like Backwater Eddy are predicting a good fall run. He always seems to have a really good grasp of what is happening on the river. As for myself, I see hopeful signs, but am taking a wait and see approach.:-) If the run doesn't develop there are other options available for my holidays."
542964,Guest,2004-08-26 08:19:00,0,Not sure about Winipeg but...... Don't you hear Morson Ontario calling you?
542973,Todd_NE,2004-08-26 12:00:00,1330,"Hmmm... Black Dog. If you are who I think you are your email is full! Like normal. I am probably going to be in Nestor Falls next weekend! Todd If your walleye ain't green, it's probably a small one."
542977,Guest,2004-08-26 13:26:00,0,"Time to try Tobin, Todd. Your time slot is good."
542980,Guest,2004-08-26 14:46:00,0,"Who do you think I am? Hint- How about picking up Vern on the way up next weekend. ""The only good dog is a black dog"""
542988,Guest,2004-08-26 19:48:00,0,"Todd, Sent you an email, drop me a line if your still headed up to Nestor Falls. [email protected]"
542995,Todd_NE,2004-08-27 06:41:00,1330,Jeff?? I know too many guys that like fishing and dogs Todd Walleye boats don't qualify as dinghy's in Cabo
542997,Guest,2004-08-27 07:29:00,0,Heading up to Morson today with the family. hope to get the sanuna stove installed.....also to do a little pre-fishing for next weekend. I will also check on turtle portage (see if its working)we might get up to Whitefish for some trout......
543000,wallidiver,2004-08-27 08:53:00,50,"Turtle portage was operable the first of August, although cable was binding up on the east side.. You had to throw a rope over it and keep tension as you were putting you boat back into LOTW. The cable had alot of fray in it. I didn't take my boat over it, just help another boat who had bound there's up. If they haven't put a new cable on and your fishing in Todds 21ft. I'd be leary."
