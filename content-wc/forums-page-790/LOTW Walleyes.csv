We are a mixed group of musky/walleye guys and are planning on going next July. Some of the walleye guys are giving me grief becaues they say the eye fishing will not be very good that time of year. I posted this on another board and someone responded that it is good all year. If so, what kind of patterns work at this time? Any specific lures or presentations? I am not asking for the trade secrets, but we are going to have some preliminary meetings soon (half the fun of fishing trips)and I'd like to have some documentation to show the naysayers. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks! Poke"

The main population will be slightly deeper than 20', however some will be very shallow on top of submerged underwater reefs and can be taken on Shad Raps. However, you will have to really cover ground for the real shallow ones. They will be big though. The majority of fish will be deeper and really fall for a bottom bouncer and spinner rig with a three hook snell and crawler."
