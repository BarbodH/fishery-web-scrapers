Caught plenty of smallmouth, with 2- 18 inchers by my partners, most in current areas, though some on the inside and outside of the weedline. One guy caught 29, 30, and 31.5 inch walleyes. I caught a 26 incher, though lost 2 others that might have been larger. We caught incidental pike up to 37 inches. One muskie around 30 inches. I caught quite a few walleye in the rapids and adjacent areas fishing for smallmouth. The water was down probably one foot and there wasn't as much current as is usual. The weather was 5-10 degrees cooler than normal, cloudy and wet frequently. Don"
