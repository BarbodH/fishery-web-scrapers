543086,Guest,2004-08-30 15:11:00,0,I was just at http://www.justfishontario.com and the front page had a spread of seven big muskies all caught in one week. I have never heard of that happening at one lodge in one week. But either had the lodge owner. Wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
543088,Guest,2004-08-30 15:25:00,0,I was up at LOTW that week...a Wisconsin muskie club was staying at Mylie's so there were a lot guys pounding the water pretty hard. Still a great accomplishment that shows LOTW is a world class muskie lake.
543111,Guest,2004-08-31 16:25:00,0,"Spoke with several people in the area that have been around forever and nobody had ever heard of a week like that. The whole thing was so exciting I had to buy my own muskie rod and reel and believe me. My lack of interest in going out fishing is legendary to those that know me so that getting me to buy a fishing rod was quite an accomplishment. The Wisconsin bunch had 10 guys fishing. Only 3 of the big fish were caught by that group. There were actually 8 big fish, but one of the pictures was very poor quality so not included in the spread on http://www.justfishontario.com The most important point is that 7 of them were caught in Sabaskong Bay so don't let anyone tell you that the only place to catch 50 inch fish is the NW Angle. With those 8 from that week, the total 50 inch fish caught by guests/customers of Mylie's is 12 so far this year and several more at the 48 inch mark. Follow the link from the JustFishOntario site to the Mylie's site for more great muskie pictures. Saboskong needs a muskie slogan. How about: ""Sabaskong Bay: Big Fish Live Here!"" Enjoy the rest of the fishing season. P.S. The walleye fishing has been good too! HAHA"
543113,Guest,2004-08-31 17:06:00,0,"Thanks for the clarification Justin...no question Mylie's showed that huge fish can be caught out of Morson, and a lot of them. Thanks to you guys the secret is out and us regular Morson fishermen will now have a lot more competition for those fish, eh?}("
543121,MTJ,2004-09-01 12:47:00,106,"Justin, How about a big sign on the point north of the resort: ""Stay in Sabaskong, the Angle is closed"" Just an idea, Mark"
543127,Guest,2004-09-01 15:37:00,0,"Hey Mark, Now I think we're getting somewhere!! I had to laugh when another guest of ours sent me a picture of a 50+ inch muskie that someone had caught on the angle the same week that all these big fish were being caught in Sabaskong. He marvelled at the size and said he might have to try muskie fishing. I told him that would be a great idea and that ""as a matter of fact...."" Well you know the rest of the story. Needless to say, he was quite impressed. Of course I'm biased, but I think Morson is the perfect base for fishing Lake of the Woods, no matter what species you are after. You're pretty much in the middle of the action and can go in every direction and find fish."
