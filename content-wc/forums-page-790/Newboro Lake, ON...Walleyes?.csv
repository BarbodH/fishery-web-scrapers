543133,Sluggo / NY,2004-09-02 08:23:00,727,"One of my fishing group talked us into trying Sterling Lodge on Newboro Lake for our annual northern excursion next week. I've been told that this is strictly a bass/pike fishery. Being a die hard walleye guy, I'm a bit unhappy about this. Anyone familiar with this lake? Being part of the Rideau chain, I'm surprised that there are no walleye in it! I'd sure love to hear differently! I'd rather jig or bottom bounce all week for a couple walleyes than catch bass all day! Thanks..Good Fishing, Sluggo (Chris)"
