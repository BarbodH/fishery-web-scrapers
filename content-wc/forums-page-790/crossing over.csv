543093,Guest,2004-08-31 07:21:00,0,I will be crossing over at International Falls on the 18th of Sept in the early AM 8 or 9am. How long of wait do you think I am in for. I have crossed over many times before just never this late in the year. I also am wondering about fishing this late in the year. I will be on a moose hunt and we will only be hunting early am and late pm.So we will have lots of time to fish for walleye and pike. Just wondering how fishing is and what the hot baits are this time of year. Any infor will help . Thanks Abe
