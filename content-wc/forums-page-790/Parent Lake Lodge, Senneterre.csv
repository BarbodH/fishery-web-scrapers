If so, please describe the accomodations, the boat docks, launch ramps and the walleye bite during the month of June. We are group of about 15 who are trying to make plans now for the summer of 2005. THANKS, in advance!! JerryJ"
543078,Guest,2004-08-30 11:43:00,0,I have fished Parent lake in the spring(May)2000 - the water was very high and the lake is huge...we did not do very well in the fish department either....only 8 between 10 guys - although we where only there for the weekend - and it snowed the whole time....the accomadations are good - the docking is also good - I have been to better areas...but they are good for the price...you get what you pay for... Let me know if you need anymore info - I would suggest Ten Mile Lodge as a great spot for fishing in June - you can't beat lake Dumoine...we caught over 300 between 6 guys in 4 days... thanks Fisher

Accomodations are very basic--cabins, with a small store for essentials. Cook your own meals. Small town (Senneterre) about 10 miles away to get provisions such as gas, beer, etc... Nice boat dock at lodge, and a great public launch very close. Problem is however, that the better fishing is at the north end of the lake in June, so it is unlikely that you will be using either. We trailer our boats daily about twenty miles north, launch off of a sandy beach, and then run about 5 to 10 miles further north to fish. Fishing is good. Shallow water jig fishing catches most of our fish."
