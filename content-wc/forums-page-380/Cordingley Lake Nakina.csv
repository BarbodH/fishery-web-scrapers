1774073,vteye,2013-05-14 12:48:00,812,I spoke with Remi who said Cordingly is NOT looking good for this weekend. He did not think he would be able to fly into the outpoststhis weekend. I suggest calling him before you leave.

1786113,onetimedave,2013-05-18 20:34:00,502,"Ice is out on ""C"" lake in Nakina"
1786505,Mike Borger,2013-05-19 05:55:00,1554,"Talked to Eddie late last night and according to him the ice was most definitelt NOT out in Cordingly yesterday. It's starting to break, but there was still tons of ice and no one was flying out of there. The guys flying into Brace must have flown from Geraldton.Most guys will have zero issues with there trip starting on the 25th. I still think our trip to Windsor could be screwed though. In order for our trip to happen he needs to fly into Blackbirch this week and fly boats for us from there into Windsor.Blackbirch is a big lake with no water flow and far enough north of Nakina that I'm starting to freak out right now LOL!"
1787873,onetimedave,2013-05-19 15:16:00,502,Christine of AWO said Remi flew off the lake yesterday.
1788121,Mike Borger,2013-05-19 17:00:00,1554,Good to hear if true. All I can tell you is the man was at Nakina Air Service's base at 2pm yesterday and the lake in front was still covered with ice. One of the guys was trying to push the ice clear with a boat with no success.
