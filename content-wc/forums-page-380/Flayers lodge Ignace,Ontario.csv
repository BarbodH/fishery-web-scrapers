I have been to this Lodge several times over the years. Here's my e-mail, you can contact me and I'll be happy to give you more info on fishing and lakes. www.dandgwalleye@msn,comGinny Frank#844"

There are no signs at the lakes so get the millage to where you park you car (right side of the road).. You can tell if you are there because it has wood stairs down to the boats. Pick one out. It is a big long lake so GPS or a good map is required. Keep to the left side of the lake as you head out, try to find a narrows with weeds. Beyond that is a shore lunch place on the left side and good fishing across the bay straight out from the shore. You pay a set price for the cabin but the cost for fishing depends on the lake you go to. If it rains and you are unable to get out of the cabin, you are not charged for fishing. I think they do not charge for use of fish house and I don't remember how many walleye you can take home. Your fish are checked as you leave Flayer's so don't go over your limit. Sandbar is no good. Wednesday they have a free dinner...you provide the fish, they have all the trimmings You should use 1/4 and 3/8 oz jigs in white, black, gold. Use white, black or gold twister tails if you are not getting any fish. Other lakes that I have not fished are Arethusa and Elephant. Again you have to drive to them. Minnows must be bought. Hard to believe that worms and leeches rarely catch fish."

Decent cabins. very nice fishing cleaning house.We have never done well on Sand Bar lake. So we have to drive to a lake every day. We take our own boats. It is about a 1.75 hour drive back to the north landing on Kukukus(Elephant). No signs telling you where to turn. It is not for the faint of heart. Generally, there several washouts where your motor on your boat will hit and drag on the ground as you drive thru the creek. Goat trail at the end will scatch your paint on your truck. 4 wheel drive is a must. Other lakes are closer, but still on gravel roads, which will beat up your trailer. You also will have to head back to Ignace to fill up your truck will gas due to all the driving. It isn't a long trip back to town, but driving every day uses lots of gas.Overall, our fishing experience has been mixed. Some awesome days, some slow days. We have fished a total of 12 different lakes in the area. Smirch by far is the hardest drive to get back to. We are going back this year after going to a different lake the last 2 trips.We are able to use minnows and leechs. However, leeches are not as effective here as they are on other lakes."
