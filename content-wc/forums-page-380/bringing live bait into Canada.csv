518663,tracker,2002-03-29 09:17:00,91,"Here is what is written in the regs, Import of Bait It is illegal to bring live fish, crayfish or salamanders intoOntario for use as bait. It is illegal to bring live leeches into Ontario for use as bait,unless you are the holder of a commercial bait licence.There is no restriction on the amount of crawlers you can bring in."
518664,fishinnut,2002-03-29 09:46:00,642,Make sure those crawlers are in bedding not dirt.
518665,vandy,2002-03-29 10:13:00,2,"Thank you for the information, would have never thought about bedding verses dirt. Excellent point. Thanks again"
518666,Mal,2002-03-30 08:46:00,55,You are correct about the worms not being in dirt and they should be in commercial bedding. What I have never been able to find in the regulations is anything about wax worms. Does anyone have any information on transporting wax worms into Canada??
518667,Guest,2002-04-07 10:34:00,0,What about the big thing of crawlers you can buy from Cabelas? Sealed and the whole deal!
518668,bphunger,2002-04-08 07:16:00,28,You should check with Cabelas but I think they are in bedding and probably came from Canada anyway.
1789449,Guest,2013-05-20 07:39:00,0,Are salted minnows allowed to be brought into Canada for fishing?
1789481,camp chef,2013-05-20 07:58:00,915,"Yes they are and for us they have been very effective, Easier to fish than live ones and stay on the hook much better."
1789617,Freytown,2013-05-20 08:55:00,770,"It depends where in Canada. In Quebec you can not bring them in from the states. Importation of bait-fishThe importation of bait-fish, dead or alive, is prohibited. http://www.mrn.gouv.qc.ca/english/pu.../bait-fish.aspThe past few years, salted dead bait fish was prohibited, best check the rules for the zone you plan to fish."
