The hottest bites are near fast moving water, however that will change by the time you arrive.Lake Nipigon is still iced up pretty good. We're crossing our fingers for fishing those big coasters in a week or sooner.Lakes have yet to turn on, but we are a little more than 48hrs since complete ice out, so just need a little time to find them.Really look forward to chasing the BIG pike this week!Will keep you updated."
