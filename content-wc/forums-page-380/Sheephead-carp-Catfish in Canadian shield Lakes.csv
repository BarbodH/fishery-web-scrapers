1763041,1-shot,2013-05-10 09:58:00,35,"Hello All,I have a question regarding sheephead, carp, catfish etc. on the canadian shield lakes. During my time fishing these lakes (started going annually around 6 years ago) neither me or anyone in our group has ever caught any of these species of fish (I'm not complaining). I did notice however in a reply to a post I made inquiring about Lady Evelyn that it could be possible that we might catch some sheephead on Lady E.What is everyone else's experience regarding catching these other species. One of the great qualities about fishing in Canada with my experience has been that almost every time you catch something, it is a quality fish. regards1-shot"
1763073,micropterus,2013-05-10 10:11:00,450,I've fished Lady E for many years. No sheephead!!
1763089,IaDave,2013-05-10 10:17:00,476,I've seen suckers caught on Minnitaki-only once
1763297,Terwalleye,2013-05-10 11:16:00,166,We do a LOT of live bait fishing. Not one bottom feeder to date. Especially them pesky bullheads at sunset in WI.
1763553,Guest,2013-05-10 12:48:00,0,"We pick up whitefish in Lady Evelyn in relitively shallow water jigging for walleye. I don't know if they are the same species that are primerily deep water fish that lake trout feed on. They are slimey buggers. I know that Lady Evelyn has suckers but sheephead would be a real surprise. Lots of them in the great lakes and tributaries (I like them, they hit a trolled rapala like a freight train). Channel cats are in the Ottawa River system so they could be present but if they were it would be common knowledge."

1782745,bartidge,2013-05-17 10:21:00,12,"I know that many of the deeper lakes in quebec around parc verendrye and lac kipawa not only hold whitefish but also hold freshwater ling or burbot (essentially a type of freshwater cod fish)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BurbotI would guess Evelyn to the west may also have, but not sure since I've never fished it.I've never landed a burbot myself but believe I have marked them on the fish finder... on the bottom in just over 100 ft. of water on Lac Dumoine. No lakers on dumoine and outfitter said they were definitely burbot on bottom at that depth...Would appear that may be one of the more common ""bottom-feeders"" you might come across in many canadian lakes..."
1783441,adempsey,2013-05-17 14:07:00,963,"I've seen carp and catfish in inland lakes, but never freshwater drum (sheephead). I am fairly confident you won't catch any in Lady Evelyn.I recall that post and my guess is he mixed up sheephead and whitefish. There are definitely whitefish and ling in Evelyn.WRT eating Drum, this guy seems to like them."
1784033,dmb130,2013-05-17 18:53:00,21,"I grew up on the upper Ottawa River, lots of catfish in her along with sturgon. Had my kids at my sisters 2 years ago, about 5 km below the Rolphton Dam, every time we went out 2 sturgon would come out and nose around us, never, ever had that happen before or since!"
