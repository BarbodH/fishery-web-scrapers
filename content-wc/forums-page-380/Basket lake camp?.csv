1787857,Guest,2013-05-19 15:15:00,0,Basket lake Camp is run bu Anita North. It has 6 cabins and a house trailer. This is a 10 mile long lake with tons of bays and inlets. I have fished this lake a week at a time for over 40 years. It is a great walleye fishery any time of year. It is located off Hwy 17 about 45 miles east of Dryden and west of Ignace. there is a sign on the roadside indicating the turnoff (North side) then 15 miles on a logging road to the camp.
