Wish I was first in, Im not going till Aug. Look at. Facebook on the Brace Lake website. Walleye are spawning in mass in front of dock. Cool video."

Pretty cool that Kyle and Terri can take that video from their float plane dock. I tried telling my wife how crazy the fishing is up there. I don't think she believed me until she saw the videos last night.
