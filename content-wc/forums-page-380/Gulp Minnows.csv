1789313,stillangling,2013-05-20 07:05:00,149,"The old adage that fish bite and don't let go of this stuff only holds true in their advertisements. The comment from the earlier poster about gulp working on the smaller lakes and not the main lake is probably a function of water temperature (smaller lakes are warmer). As other posters have noted, this stuff will work but only when the bite is really on. I have noticed that you need to work gulp aggressively to get the best results with walleye. In other words, don't give the fish too much time to really inspect it. I just went through a couple of days of fishing for pre-spawn walleye in very cold water. A slow presentation with minnows was the only thing that worked. Feel free to use gulp under those circumstances but be prepared for a day of frustration. If it makes you feel better to be able to claim that you don't use bait, have fun with that. Personally I am not interested in a handicap. If you subscribe to the notion of anglers going through stages, I guess I am stuck at the shallow end! I always have a pack of gulp drifting around in my boat but it gets used very infrequently."

Kind of an even more twisted Murphy's Law: ""If I'm doing something, it's the wrong thing!""Re: Gulp - Several years ago, we released a 28"" walleye, caught vertically fishing Gulp. I sat my rod( with Gulp on it) down to assist. When I picked up my rod, the same fish was on mine. So much for predictability/ logic /fish savvy, all the words we use to explain what we don't understand about fishing! Bill"

1786417,schick,2013-05-19 04:52:00,35,How well do Gulp minnows on a drop shot or on a jig work in comparison to real minnows for walleye?
1786465,tv4fish,2013-05-19 05:42:00,2694,"You will (of course) get various comments - my experience - IF the walleyes are ""on the bite"", the gulp minnows work - if the fish are finicky, your better off with the real thing."
1786529,octanehi5,2013-05-19 06:05:00,1104,"nothing beats the real thing,but there are locations that do not allow live minnows"
1786561,Tonyo,2013-05-19 06:34:00,212,"In our many attempts to save on the over all cost of bait while in Canada, minnows still are the best bait for catching large numbers of walleye on our lake. I agree that if you are on the bite that you probably could use a raisin, which we have done, to catch them but for the most part we continue to use the tried and true minnow. TonyO"
1786721,Glenman12,2013-05-19 07:29:00,762,"yes, that's been my experience too."
1786737,Jack77,2013-05-19 07:34:00,168,We had pretty poor luck with both Gulp minnows and leeches. They didn't even outfish Yum grubs let alone real minnows. Gulp will staying home from now on.
1786745,Fishin Fun,2013-05-19 07:35:00,218,"The Gulp vs. Real debate has been brought up many times. My experience is that if the walleyes are biting, Gulp will work. But real minnows still out fish Gulp in every situation I've used them. Even if the walleyes are biting. I still bring a small amount of Gulp to have with me if I run out of live bait. For me it is strictly a back up."
1787145,bigdaddyguns,2013-05-19 08:36:00,608,"Does anybody know the ""shelf life"" of opened gulp alive? I have an opened container of minnows I used a couple of years ago but did not touch last year. I opened it yesterday and they smelled different ...a vinegar addition to the aroma bouquet. I am guessing gulp alive are good for a season but probably not the best carried over to the next season and beyond. Or maybe they are like a wine and get better with time?"
1788369,packpro,2013-05-19 18:53:00,695,"We fish a variety of lakes in Canada. There are some tough portages we hit that may only get fished 5-10 times a year. Often we have run out of live bait-minnows in 2-3 hours. We usually take 8- 10 dozen for 2-3 guys in the boat. This has happened on 3 different bodies of water. We shift to gulp and green twister tails. Absolutely no drop off. In fact, we pitch the gulp and work it back to the boat. It selects for bigger fish. Probably 2"" larger average size. Thinking we have hit the holy grail of bait we have tried it on the main lake, and a few others locations in the area. On those lakes, the live bait outfished the Gulp 11-1. Tried the experiment on consecutive days same result. Moral of the story, I think it depends on the body of water for Gulp and live bait works everywhere. However when the Gulp works it works great."
