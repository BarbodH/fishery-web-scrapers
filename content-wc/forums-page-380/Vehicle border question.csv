One of the SUV's we're using belongs to an individual not going along on the trip. Are there any special credentials we need outside of his current registration and current proof of insurance (both US & Canada)? Of all the years and trips to Canada's great north, I've never had this situation. Thanks for the guidance and suggestions. Best."
1785217,NARDA 1,2013-05-18 10:21:00,636,I think your best bet would be to contact that border crossing and ask them what they would require.
1785233,Terwalleye,2013-05-18 10:27:00,166,"Our group researched just this question last year. We brought a notarized letter from the owner stating it was with his permission. Oh, and they never asked. lol"
1785521,@Lunker,2013-05-18 13:28:00,835,"I would second Terwalleye's suggestion, along with the proof of insurance, etc."
