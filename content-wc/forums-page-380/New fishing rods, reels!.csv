Like any sport, the price range is significant. More often than not, if you buy bargain gear, it will fail you at the worst possible moment. The rods I used vary in price from $50 to $189. Believe it or not, the rods between $50 and $100 have been the best performers. When it comes to reels, don't skimp. Again, buy what is comfortable to you. I would rather have 3 really nice set ups, than 5 mediocre combinations."
1754713,LoDo,2013-05-07 21:02:00,721,"How much do you spend on rods and reels? Are you $100+ on St Croix rods and $200+ on shimano reels? Do you have equipment that is handy down? How often are you buying new equipment? I'm overly excited to get going on our trip this year. Simply trying to get some chatter going.. I spent a few hours at BassPro last weekend and priced out some new gear. Ive got everything I need, but like most men that fish, ski, snowboard, camp, etc... I like to upgrade. I've got my eye on a slick St Croix rod and debating on the buy. I don't need it, but want it. ha! Is there honestly a big difference between a $75 rod and a $250 rod?"
1755377,Bigstorm,2013-05-08 07:14:00,799,"Personally, I would spend as much as you can justify. From experience, I would spend more on the rod as you get more sensitivity with the higher quality rods (and a lifetime warrenty). I have several St Croix and serveral GLoomis rods. Most of my rods are in the $200 to $250 range while most of my reels are in the $125 range"
1755497,REG,2013-05-08 07:34:00,445,"My two go-to jigging rods are a St. Croix and an All Star. Both very nice but not top of the line for their respective brands. Rods are the one thing that I will not mail-order just because I want to test their weight, balance, and action in the store before I buy. I've held some expensive rods that I disliked the feel of - and found some cheap graphites that I loved the action and feel. If you're jigging or live bait fishing a subtle presentation, you have to be able to feel what's going on down there. Buy what makes you happy! When it comes to reels, I've had very good luck with Shimano - but I buy toward the lower end of their product line too. In my opinion, the rod has way more to do with your success than the reel - as long as the thing is the right size, reasonably smooth, balanced, and has a decent drag. (but speaking of drag, Im a dinosaur - I still use mono and back-reel)"
1755601,Mackenzie280,2013-05-08 07:47:00,42,"My wife enjoys fishing, but could never understand why a fishing rod could cost $200 - 400. What could possibly be the difference?I purchased my wife a St. Croix legend , after her first day out, she looked at me and said that her new rod is better than any of her old rods.Which were middle of the pack, not cheap but not overly priceyI believe you get what you pay for, but buy what you are most comfortable with.But then again thats just me."
1755633,camp chef,2013-05-08 07:54:00,915,I buy expensive rods and they last for years. I buy reels under $100 and replace them every year or two depending on how much they get used. We wear the drag out of the reels and replace them.
1755753,MrSimon,2013-05-08 08:11:00,922,"I'm a firm believer that most consumer items have four levels: 1. Inexpensive and cheaply made. They will work, sometimes serve you well, but often perform poorly and break. 2. Moderately priced and well made. Not super fancy, but performs well and lasts a while. 3. High end luxury item. Super pricey, lots of bells and whistles etc etc 4. Custom made. Super pricey but also super awesome. I tend to either go with #2 or #4. In terms of fishing rods, #2 would be somewhere between $50 and $100 for a rod and between $40 and $80 for a reel. You get excellent value for your money. If I have the cash though, I'll buy a hand made custom rod in a heartbeat. There is just so much awesome that goes into a custom rods that it justifies the cost. I mean seriously, you can get them with your name printed on the blank ... how cool is that!!"
1755793,adempsey,2013-05-08 08:19:00,963,"I spend about $100-$125 on the reel (spinning) and the same for the rod. Usually a Shimano reel and a St.Croix rod. The less expensive St.Croix rods are nice. Check out the Eyecon series. All of mine are Premiers, but I wouldn't hesitate to pick up an Eyecon.If I were to go with a baitcasting set up, I'd probably shell out at least $200. Which is also why I don't own any low profile baitcasters. If I had more disposable income, I'd likely go up to $200 because I do own a rod in that class that I got on sale for half price and feel it would be worth the extra money. My favorite rod.I also don't buy them from BPS as the prices tend to be too high (unless on sale), at least here in Canada."
1755841,vteye,2013-05-08 08:25:00,812,"I think there are some nice value graphite rods out there in the sweet spot $50-100 range, Allstar, had good luck with Quantum etc. I was buying Simano but upper mid level reels have become overpriced and quality is no longer there. I suggest checking out the Penn battle series found to be smoother, more consist and better overall value."

1757721,RapShad,2013-05-08 17:57:00,76,"I fished Lac Seul with my dad every summer for about 8 years with a few mid range Bass Pro Shops brands rods, they worked well and caught plenty of fish. I then started using a Loomis rod and there is an incredible difference when moving up to that class especially for my Bass and Walleye rods. Moral of the story if you are more of a beginner maybe making your first few trips up North and not ready to make a big investment go with the mid range brands they probably wont let you down, but if you are ready to step it up a notch or two go out and buy a Loomis, St. Croix, or Browning."
