1779377,Hawker,2013-05-16 07:45:00,3967,"Latest ice out in (?) years, 23rd annual trip to LOW last week of May. Typically fish smallmouth, walleye, pike & crappie in the Stephens Bay/Miles Bay/Stoney area and this year will be different in targeting those species I know. Typically cabbage is just starting to emerge along with a couple other grass types but I'm thinking this won't be occurring this year during the time we are there! Current water temps are in the neighborhood of 49-52 degrees and have a good chance of rising a few degrees when we arrive there a week from today.Looking for suggestions on where (other than emerging grass) and how we (wife & I) might target these species in relation to where we normally target them, and suggestions as to the best 3-4 baits per species you'd suggest for this trip this year. I COULD bring everything including the kitchen sink and plunder through a plethora of stuff while there in an attempt get on fish, but I'd rather go with some tried and true methods/baits etc from folks who normally fish this close to ice out in these kind of areas so that I don't have to pack sooooooooooo much stuff. I'm all ears, and any and all help would be greatly appreciated!Thanks!!!"
1780217,Maskinonge,2013-05-16 11:19:00,13,"I'll be up at Sabaskong Bay area for the first time in mid June. If everything from weeds to forage is supposed to be pushed back by two weeks or so, we'll have to come up with a new game plan. In a typical year, my understanding that mid June is a transition between shallower, rocky shoreline-based walleyes in 8 - 15 ft. depths, and hump/reef-based walleyes in 15-25 ft. of water. Mid June is also typically mayfly central, so I hope to be avoiding that hatch. What does a typical early June walleye bite look like on LOTW, or in that area specifically? Any weeds up? I know it's all conjecture to guess what it will look like in a month, but I think a safe assumption would be for it to look like late May/early June. Also, I wonder if a quick warm spell will accelerate things and the season will make up ground? Any info or advice is always welcome, glad to have found this place!"
1780417,NathanH,2013-05-16 12:56:00,697,"While I have not fished LOW, I do fish a ton on a variety of water right after ice out or opening weekends in WI, MN,MI and Canada so I get around. I think when your dealing with cold water after ice out your going to make or break your trip Jigging. Thats just one guys opinion. As far as crankbaits if thats something you like, Husky Jerks/ Rouge's will be solid producers and I am also a fan of the Rapala Fat Rap, and the #8 jointed husky jerk. Small profile has some movement but is not wild. These lures should cross species. You cannot go wrong with the shad rap but the action sometimes is just to much early."
1781137,stillangling,2013-05-16 18:30:00,149,"Hawker, Not sure where you are getting your water temperature info from but I think that the numbers you are quoting are high. I took a look at the Lake of the Woods Control board site. Temps from the outflow of Rainy and LOW are in the 42 - 44 F range as of today. If somebody is telling you 52 F they must be in a back bay with a very narrow band of warm water on top. Any kind of a wind and you will be right back to the 42 F range. The ice literally just left the lake. In terms of fishing techniques. Go slow and use meat! Walleye in much of NW Ontario will be right in the middle of the spawn over the next week or so. Over the last 20 plus years of fishing walleye on the opener in NW Ontario I have normally found these late springs to be a very tough bite. On one occasion, years ago during a late spring, I tried fishing walleye that were right in the middle of the spawn on a shoal that was off an island. You could actually see them right in the middle of the day chasing each other. One of the most frustrating experiences ever. Spent most of the day bombing artificials. Had lots of follows but they just would not bite. If I had to do it over again, I would anchor and fish live bait on a jig and would use a very slow presentation. I also think that the pike will be moving slow enough that you would be well served if you were soaking dead bait under a float in the back bays. Quick strike rigs and set the hook early. Crappie are always a puzzle for me during this period so all I can say is good luck in that department."
1781297,Bill Krejca,2013-05-16 19:42:00,6107,"Re: Weeds - I believe the water level also has a bearing on weed growth. Higher water means the weeds get a little less sunlight, and get a slower start (I feel). High water also can make the water a little less clear, restricting weed growth. Sometimes low water maybe makes the weeds grow a little fast, due to more sunlight, and maybe clearer water. Low water also can mean that the normal weed growth by shore is now up on shore, so some habitat is lost. Now factor in cooler water. Bill"
1781809,Hawker,2013-05-17 04:43:00,3967,"Stillangling:I very much appreciate the tips on using meat! Not set up with quick strike rigs, but that can be ""fixed"" along the way with a couple of stops we normally make. I'm assuming frozen Cisco's will work well for soaking dead bait under a cork?? Usually fish jig an minnow for the eyes anyway but likely will be looking in different areas for them this year. Crappie are most times a crapshoot for us as well and really isn't an issue, still wondering about the smallies though.I'm pretty confident in the water temps given me (for that area at least)! No doubt main lake water temps are as you stated, down in the low 40's as ice just went out this past week. They (Young's Wilderness Camp) are located in the far east corner of Stephens Bay, a rather shallow area with average water depth of roughly 10 ft, so I can see those temps (in that location) being a tad higher than main lake/deeper water areas. The 52 degree reading was in the back of a couple of the bays commonly referred (locally anyway) to as East Bay and South Bay (5-7 ft average depth) so I'm not questioning it too strongly!Bill:Yeah, I'm not expecting to find much in the way of weeds this go-round as we normally do! Kind of a bummer but certainly not going to make me change my trip plans! It will force me to find new/different techniques and possibly areas to fish this time thus my OP, but it's going to be a great trip regardless of the fish catching or lack of LOL!!Appreciate the tips etc and look forward to more as folks will share it!!"
