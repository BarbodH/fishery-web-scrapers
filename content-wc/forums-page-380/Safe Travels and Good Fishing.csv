Hope the ice is off your destination lake, the wait at the border crossing is short, and the fish are ravishingly hungry! Above all, come home with a smile on your face, blood pressure fifteen points lower, and a renewed appreciation for good friends, welcoming hosts, and the great outdoors.I'll be right behind you Monday for five solo days then the annual week with the crew of six. . . . year 35, trip 50 or so."

I got 880 miles from Denver to Devils Lake, we will fish a day with Matt Taylor on Devils then another 320 miles to Ft Francis. Plan to pull the entire 1200 in one long drive home. So if ya see a green Navigator with 4 guys smokin cigars, loaded to the gills with gear and with Walleye Central stickers on the back, rippin up the highway headin north..................... Well, that would probably be me. I also wish safe travels and good fishing for everyone!"
