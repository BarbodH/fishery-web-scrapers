1781121,WalleyeWally28,2013-05-16 18:25:00,298,Right. My card simply states that my coverages are not less than the minimum statutory requirements for all Canadian Provinces and I must show the card if asked by the police. This is printed in both English and French.
1781217,Catman59,2013-05-16 19:34:00,345,Yep what they said .......... no extra charges or anything like that. Just nice to have things in order when crossing into Canada.
1780481,justin99,2013-05-16 13:13:00,126,"Leaving to go up north tomorrow, just had a thought do I need anything special from my insurance company for the boat and truck to be legally insured their? My agent says im good to go with the cards I have nothing extra is needed. BUT thought Id ask."
1780505,rwl,2013-05-16 13:25:00,1655,Id trust your agent.
1780537,WalleyeWally28,2013-05-16 13:30:00,298,"My insurance Company, State Farm, sends me a special card that says my truck is covered in Canada. They say it is not required for my boat. I think it depends on the insurance company if you need a special card or not."
1780545,Larry S,2013-05-16 13:50:00,665,"I also have State Farm,prior to last year they would send me an insurance card for Canada. Last year when I called to have a card sent to me for my drive to Canada,I was told that I now Donot need an insurance card for Ontario & Manitoba, that my regular card would be honored in these provinces"
1780673,WalleyeWally28,2013-05-16 14:24:00,298,Interesting. I called my agent about two weeks ago and received the card a couple days later. I wonder if the difference is that I didn't specify Ontario & Manitoba? I'll have to check that out.
1780801,Catman59,2013-05-16 15:05:00,345,I have always gotten special insurance card for my trips to Canada. I just called my agent and he says they are still needed ......... ( Progressive)
1780889,Golden Eagle,2013-05-16 15:28:00,2642,"Is your agent charging additional premium for ""special insurance"" in Canada? Might be a good idea to call the company for clarification on that one. See if it shows up on your declaration's page of the policy. Reading your policy will show that you are already covered in Canada without making a phone call.Mexico is a different situation and additional coverage must be purchased. And, same as heartburn, don't go to Mexico in the first place."
1780913,chevtow,2013-05-16 15:43:00,691,"I have State Farm and have always gotten a special card for when I go to Canada. Doesn't cost anything. I've never been asked to see it, but I haven't been involved in an accident or pulled over in Canada either."
1780961,WalleyeWally28,2013-05-16 16:15:00,298,Ditto for me. No additional cost - just a phone call to my local agent and he mails it to me.
1781073,JayM5209,2013-05-16 17:48:00,1050,"x5. I stopped in his office yesterday and they printed mine out for me. They used to fill out a card by hand, but since last year State Farm programmed the form into their software. They call up my record, hit a button and it prints. By the way, the point is not about needing special or additional coverage in Canada, it just provides acceptable/easily recognized documentation as proof of insurance. The card that used to be hand written by my agent was actually a Canadian form from, I think, Transport Canada."
