1773649,J Arendt,2013-05-14 10:07:00,45,To all the Gullrock guys-- leaving in the morning for Gullrock. Will post fishing results I hope upon return.
1773769,tackleman,2013-05-14 10:44:00,444,"I just got back from town, I talked to ian cooke who told me that he has been trying to move the ice from his docks and with just the wave action from his boat he has moved the ice about 150 feet from his dock and he thinks all we need now is some wind from the west to shift it and break it up. I haven't been down to my dock (the sight of the ice is just too depressing) so I can't verify the thickness of it."
1774953,Minnow Man,2013-05-14 18:10:00,85,Bay in front of Golden Hook Camp on Gullrock Lake is 100% ice free. Stoney Bay is 100% ice free. Will go for a boat ride tomorrow. Will post ice conditions for the lake then
1775233,stillangling,2013-05-14 19:58:00,149,"I was on 105 yesterday and it looked pretty tight up there in comparison to lakes farther south. Cedar and Perrault were tight to the shore. Lake of the Woods is looking pretty good at this point. Almost all of the Big Traverse is clear. Absolutely crazy west wind today in Kenora and that will really help. We will be all clear in the Kenora area by the weekend, except for a couple of our bigger trout lakes but I think you run the risk of playing cards for a few days if you are heading to Red Lake."
1778185,Minnow Man,2013-05-15 19:35:00,85,"Launched my boat at Golden Hook Camp on Gullrock Lake. Headed out of the bay to the main lake and ran into ice at the white arrow. Some open water around the Islands at Carmichael Bay. Stood up on the bow & could see miles of ice down the lake. Poked my boat into the ice and it was breaking up quite easily, didn't go far, didn't want to scratch my boat. Lots of open water for me to go fishing, if there is still ice on the lake for the opener, I'll use it in my beer cooler.... free ice is good."
1781865,walleyeduran,2013-05-17 05:14:00,286,"Minnow Man, you mean your fish cooler, you can't have a beer cooler in the boat in Ontario."
1782513,Strickers cut,2013-05-17 09:05:00,33,He never said it was gonna be in the boat
1782697,Golden Eagle,2013-05-17 10:10:00,2642,"Fish cop, Don Maw, charges around $180 a can for those refreshments and he keeps the evidence. I have not experienced what I'm writing about, but I've heard about it."
