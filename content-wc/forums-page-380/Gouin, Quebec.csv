1775265,MikeG1,2013-05-14 20:11:00,434,I'll be at Stramond lake lodge the first week of June. I assume the eyes and pike will be in back bays and the lakers relatively shallow. What are my best bests in targeting theses 3 species? Thanks.

1784673,a3dad,2013-05-18 06:10:00,115,Lac du mal√® (very most north west) still is partially covered in that image. Boy wish I was going this year! Anyone have into on the water levels?
1762713,Freytown,2013-05-10 08:23:00,770,I will be fishing the Gouin the last week of May. This will be my first time going this early. Has anyone fished there this early...any tips will be appreciated. Thxs
1762905,a3dad,2013-05-10 09:24:00,115,"Hey Freytown, I fish the Gouin every other year during the last week of may. I can tell you that every year is different depending on the weather. We are aways hoping to catch them post spawn in the back bays, but years like 2012 we had 80 degree weather and they had moved out to primary points. Been watching the ice out and it still looks like most of the reservoir is still covered. I prefer a late ice out which should hopefully do well for you. Which section are you heading to? Kevin"
1763025,retire55,2013-05-10 09:53:00,1029,Satellite map on 8 May shows the Gouin still frozen.
1763129,Freytown,2013-05-10 10:21:00,770,I will be fishing Baie du Sud. What satellite map site are you looking at? Thxs
1763225,vteye,2013-05-10 10:53:00,812,"Freytown - Our group has fished it early and found fish near the ""closed"" spawning areas. Bottom bouncers with multi hook worm rigs have helped us find fish and then jig them."
1763369,a3dad,2013-05-10 11:35:00,115,Satellite images here: http://lance-modis.eosdis.nasa.gov/i...subset=Chapais You'll have to find a clear day and locate the Gouin. Here's the image for May 8th as Retire55 mentioned. The Red indicates ice.
1763473,Freytown,2013-05-10 12:20:00,770,"Thxs Kevin for the image & Baie du Sud appears to be mostly open except for the northern end. I, sure by the end of the month the ice will be all gone. Thxs everyone else for the tips."
1764017,retire55,2013-05-10 16:26:00,1029,The image I used was from http://coastwatch.glerl.noaa.gov/mod...egion=g&page=1 I used 8 May 15.52 GMT because the Gouin area was quite visible.
1764345,dh99,2013-05-10 19:12:00,222,I fish gouin and i am from quebec. Early on in the year they are close to spawnings grounds. Jigs and leachs are ver effective. Or rigging with leachs or worms.Dh
1774009,Freytown,2013-05-14 12:18:00,770,Todays satellite image shows Baie du Sud ice free.
