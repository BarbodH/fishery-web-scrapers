We heard this year 'if you want hot fishing, you better boat up to Chamberlin Narrows'. This was the worst year fishing for us out of the last four. We did catch fish, just not what we were looking for. Does anyone have any suggestions for camping facilities on the N/NW part of the lake, near or out of Ear Falls? We like to camp, we don't need cabins (too many guys snore like they're sawing logs), we would want water and electricity. Launching boats daily is not an issue, but if we could dock right on Lac Seul, that is preferred. Any suggestions are appreciated. Thanks."
