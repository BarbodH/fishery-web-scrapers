558929,old fisherman,2006-06-28 05:49:00,545,May flys are done. Water temp in the high 60's and fishing was not good. We returned last Friday. Might be better now.
558985,Guest,2006-07-01 08:39:00,0,We are heading up on 7/7 so continued updated reports would be greatly appreciated.
559007,Guest,2006-07-02 10:00:00,0,"Returned on Friday. Had good but not spectacular walleye fishing. Mostly small to good eaters. Caught them on spinners and jigs. Reefs and shorelines. Did not find any kind of pattern. Minnows, crawlers and plastics all worked. Muskie action was very good. A number of fish in the 45-50"" range werew caught by guys working out of Mylies. We started to find the fish on the rocks. Surface baits were really great. Good luck."
559013,Guest,2006-07-02 18:02:00,0,Thanks for the update Dick. Hopefully the Muskie bite continues and we can find the walleyes as well.

We caught good numbers and above average size of walleyes near Shore island. We also raised many large muskies in the narrows north of Shore island. We could not get much to bite but they would follow anything you threw at them. Our group of 5 boats caught 5 muskies, biggest being 44 inches. All together we figured we had somewere in the area of 90 to 100 different follows during the course of the week. Not bad considering that we all fished walleyes and smallies as well. There was a major mayfly hatch on June 25th near the Shore island area. They didn't hatch out on Skeet island until June 28th. Even with the hatches going on we still caught walleye on leeches, nightcrawlers and crank baits."
