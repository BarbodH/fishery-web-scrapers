Are there any reasonally price liquor or beer stores that are open all night near International Falls? I am guessing the duty free store will be closed. But does anyone out there know for sure? We would probably be passing through the border around 4:00 am. Want to purchase before we cross the border and don't want to haul it any further than we have to. Pat T"
