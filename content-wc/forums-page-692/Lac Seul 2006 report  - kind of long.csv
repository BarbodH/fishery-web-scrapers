558980,wooglin,2006-06-30 16:11:00,371,"Just got back from the Hudson/Sioux Lookout side of Lac Seul last night. We spent five full days on the water and a half day (the evening we arrived). We didn't limit out the first night, but ran into enough pike to eat. Fishing was as tough as we've seen it, but here is my daily report. Evening 1: Stopped by WildCats lodge (he's on this board) but he and his crew were not there. WildCat, I hope you got my message! Anyway, we didn't run into jack for walleye, but managed a few plus some pike, so we had a decent fry that night. Day 1: It was about 80 degrees and sunny, hardly any wind. We had a very difficult time finding fish and basically baked in the boat all day. We fished from Websters Bay on over to Italian/Kewatin bay and everwhere in between, and had a difficult time finding fish. Again, we ran into enough for a decent dinner. Day 2: Weather was nicer, had some wind and clouds. Headed both boats up to Manitou Rapids and beyond. Hit Grassy Bay and got on some fish. Could have limited if we kept the 13inch dinks - managed to fill the livewells (on ice, dead) for a good nights eats. Day 3: Weather was overcast and windy. Had some big storms come through, so we beached and managed to get hailed on and watched a great lightning show. Figured we'd stay around the Hudson side and on up to Crooked Rapids. Got on a few fish, but again nothing special. Had a decent shorelunch and saved some for dinner. I picked up a 36inch pike, biggest on the week. A real fat one too. Day 4: Weather was windy and partly cloudy/sunny. Fish picked up, we managed about 70+ walleye in our boat alone. Northern were heavy today, so were smallies. We fished mainly right around the Websters Bay bridge and back on the sand bars. Day 5: Weather was windy and partly cloudy/sunny again. Hit the same spots as day before, except bigger fish moved in - great friers, 16 - 17 inchers. Nailed them good again, kept our freezers and went back to camp for venison brats. Jigging worked best for us this year, using anything from live crawlers, to some minnows, and leeches, all the way over to gulp minnows, storm minnows and powerbait plastics. All and any plastics seemed to work as long as your jig was heavy enough to get the bait down. Walleye were not hot, actually our worst year - but when we did get on them, it was in about 10 FOW or less, and typically in wind blown bays in the weeds and sand. Can we blame the bad bite on the mayfly hatch about 8 days before we arrived? Maybe, but we still had fun. Pike were hot, hot, hot this year. I landed about 15-20 per day, which is how I like it. 36inch pike and 22inch walleye were our biggest. Ran into a few 18-19inch smallies jigging as well. Trolling didn't produce much more than some pike. We marked a ton of fish in the 25-35 FOW range. We tried to jig them, but only managed one....tough to get down, and stay down there. Word in our camp was to get to Chamberlin Narrows if you want good fishing....we didn't make the trek, it was 1.5 hours at 35mph - that's a lot of gas... Anyway, we all made it home safe. PS, WEAR YOUR LIFEJACKETS. After first lauch, boat #2 hit our wake about 200 yards offshore (2 minutes into the water) and dumped 2 guys overboard - no lifejackets. Thankfully the didn't get knocked out, and both were able to get back in. Boat #1 didn't see it and we kept going. 15 minutes later, we decided to go check on them to see if they broke down, and we just saw them re-starting the boat. We learned a lesson, thankfully not the hard way. ETA: On the way out (4:45 am), we saw two moose in the ditch, a big 'ole bear and about a half dozen deer. Be careful on the road guys. HWY 502 was good, just the typical 15 miles of bumpy road. All other roads, with the exception of the standard construction in Duluth, was fine."
558987,scar,2006-07-01 09:45:00,196,"wooglin, thanks for the report. have an older buddy of mine going up with his wife and another older couple. they are leaving tomoorrow and are staying at country cabins where you stayed. can you give some specifics on where you fished in webster bay near the bridge? they wont go any further than that so any additional info on that area would be great. you should think about spending a day on minnitaki next time you are up.I can help you with some good spots. scar"
559002,wooglin,2006-07-01 20:05:00,371,"Hey Scar, thanks for the reply. We fished the weed beds on the zig-zag to Westers Bay, just after the bridge. On the way to Websters, there is a beaver hut on the right side, and directly across the bay from that are two huge bolders. Direct line is about 15 FOW. Anywhere east of that on up to the weedy shoreline is where fished. Just drop jigging in the weeds...caught plenty when they were hot. Sandbar on the far west side of Websters Bay put fish out too. We were thinking about Minitaki, especially when the 12 year old kid at the Esso gas station said 'have you tried Minitaki? Its hot right now...'. Advice from a 12 year old, classic!!"
559016,wooglin,2006-07-02 20:22:00,371,"Forgot to mention, that when we did shorelunches, we just happened to forget the pump for the white-gas burner we were going to use. So I rememered the big 'gas -vs- campfire' debate on here for shorelunches. We found some rocks and positioned them for the pan to lean on, built a fire and by the time we had the fish cleaned, the fire was hot and full of coals. We fried fish right on the shore, right on a live campfire. I won't be bringing gas anymore, it's a lot more fun and it seems a lot more 'arg-arg-arg, manly' to have it over an open fire. Works just as well, if not better, and is a lot of fun."
559018,orchard frank,2006-07-02 21:25:00,1900,"Another spot you might try is the where the power line goes under before you get to the bridge, on the north side of the channel, some good fish holding areas there. Also, it is very common for a fire ban during summer months, so gas must be used during that time. In hot, calm weather, it goes against your instincts, but we have done very well at times fishing very shallow, pitching right up to 2'. Another good area is in the wide area just past Frenchmans Head, before it narrows down again, look to your right you will see a large white rock on the shore.Start there work toward the sand bluff on the first or second break, or in the weedline near shore, have pulled some hogs out of there in as little as 3-4' of water, but also try the 18'break. Good luck"
