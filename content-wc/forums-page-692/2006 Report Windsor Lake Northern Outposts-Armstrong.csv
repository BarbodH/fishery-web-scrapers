Saturday 17th 2 guys went down to rapids at southeast end of lake,did well caught many walleye and some pike,including a 27 1/2 inch walleye whichturned out to be the biggest walleye of the trip.Myself and boatmate fished at several neckdown areas with strong current,we caught many walleyes and my boatmate got a 40 inch pike. Sunday 18th we all headed out to fish but around 1130 am the thunderclouds and abundent lightning rolled in. We all made it back to the cabin in time to experience a day long rain and thunderstorm which for about an hour was a literal monsoon! That killed the rest of sundays fishing. On Monday the 19th we got out,got rained on all day, the fishing was fair the storm pretty much made the fish uncooperative. On Tuesday,Wednesday,Thursday and Friday the fishing was great,we caught hundreds of nice size-20,21,22,23,24,and 25 inch walleyes also some nice pike in the 30 to 37 inch range All in all despite the weather we had a great trip and can highly recomend Northern Outposts to anyone looking for a great fishing Trip Larry S"
