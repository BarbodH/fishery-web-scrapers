558977,Guest,2006-06-30 14:04:00,0,We are going in 2 weeks and was wondering if there are any reports from the chain? This is our first time going to Seine River so any info would be great. THANKS

The smallies fishing was outstanding!! Basically, just find a rocky shoreline and cast into it and we caught a number of 20+"" fish. We could normally scrape together enough eyes for shorelunch and then we fished smallies and Northern. Post how you do on walleyes so I don't think that it is just me!!!"
559101,Guest,2006-07-06 15:20:00,0,"hart447,that seems about right, slow walleyes or 1or2 people doing good for short peroids. What did you catch the smallies on? We have'nt targeted smallies until this year. We troll spinner rigs for walleyes,pike and trout, if we troll past a good looking spot we would cast a spinnerbait or rattletrap but that would be about it. THANKS for replying the information will be very useful, this is our first year going to the chain we need every bit of help to get started!!! Terry"
