I'm in the process of putting together my tackle for the trip and was wondering what to bring. Based on the post from eariler in the year, it's jigs and bottom bouncers. Any advice for a first timer? I'll be flying in to Winnipeg so I can't bring a boat load."
558989,Guest,2006-07-01 10:06:00,0,"We just returned from Evergreen. Great place. We used spinners with minnows and crawlers. Many were jigging. We found pink was hot one day, brass the next, minnows ok until the last two days and crawlers were hot. The first part of the week they were in 5' of water and at the end 14'. We fished Streamboat, and Goose Island. E-mail if you would like more info. [email protected]"

558993,Guest,2006-07-01 12:34:00,0,"I would not worry about bringing a lot of gear. Gary has a large supply of spinner rigs and jigs for a good price. You are also going to be about a mile away from Four Seasons Bait shop which has a large supply. I am an experienced fisherman and I prefer using a jig with some type of meat on it. Minnow, worm or leach. With some of the lessor experienced guys who snag up a lot , or miss a lot of fish with jigs, I will have them fish with a bottom bouncer with a spinner. We all catch fish. Basically, whatever you are comfortable with fish with it. End of July you will be in 15 to 30 feet of water. If you are jig fishing 1/4 is the smallest to go, and probably use 3/8. Get a guide at least for the first day. Also, if you have not upgraded to the deluxe boat you are a fool. Their deluxe boat is very nice."
558997,Guest,2006-07-01 16:04:00,0,"Thanks Fellas, Jig fishing is my favorite and I'll be sure to be stocked up. I've always preferred to go with a straight minnow or leach but hear quite a bit about the Gulp products. Any thoughts? Jig and live bait rigs are easy to bring. I was wondering if I need to drag along all of the plugs ( if so, which ones ), planner boards, etc. How about Muskie and big Pike? Is there a few basic lures a guy should have? By the way, we have the delux boat package. 18' boat with a 50HP 4 stroke. Do I need a drift sock? Thanks fellas!"
559006,Guest,2006-07-02 09:24:00,0,"Bring your favorite Pike lures. I like the five of diamond, Williams Wobbler in the hammered nickle, and the larger Rapalas. Bass style spinners (chartreuse or white) also do well for pike. I posted an update when I got back from Lac Seul a few weeks ago, having stayed at Evergreen. I did great with the Gulp. I used a 1/4 ounce jig with chartreuse Gulp and was very impressed. I put a quarter of a crawler on this as well. Do not know for sure if I really needed the crawler, but I was not going to mess with success. Email me if you want a few spots to start with. You will not need a drift sock...i have never needed one. Bring a GPS!!![email protected]"
