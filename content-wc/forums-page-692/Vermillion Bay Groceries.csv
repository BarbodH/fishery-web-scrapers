559105,Noel,2006-07-06 16:28:00,115,Is there a decent grocery store in Vermillion Bay? Since I cant bring potatos I was hoping to buy them in Vermillion Bay along with some other grocery items that are perishable. thanks

The prices may be a little better than in vacationland. I usually stop there on the way back. They have candy bars that you can't get here in the states. There is also a Safeway in Dryden."
559107,grt1,2006-07-06 17:08:00,259,"There is also a large grocery store across from Walmart in Dryden and an IGA store on the highway in Dryden, there is a co-op store in vermillion bay, but I would suggest you shop in Dryden for better prices. HOwever, if you are coming up from the Sioux Narrows Nestor Falls highway, you may as well shop at the co-op because any savings on groceries will be used up in gas to go to Dryden."

559110,Guest,2006-07-06 17:40:00,0,"If you are going to Vermillion Bay you should try Hwy 71. Great road, same time, little traffic, and towns if you run into trouble"
559111,Guest,2006-07-06 17:54:00,0,"Hump, same time taking 71 vs. 502?? I had heard that 71 was 45-60 minutes longer, but a better road. Is it really the same time?"
559114,Guest,2006-07-06 19:21:00,0,Just paid 5.19 a gallon for milk at the co-op in Vermillion bay last week. It can be pricey.
559118,Guest,2006-07-06 21:41:00,0,Take an extra cooler along for the milk and pick it up in International Falls at the grocery store across the parking lot from Barney's Restaurant. Just ice it down and you'll be fine.
559125,Guest,2006-07-07 08:44:00,0,"I have never looked at the mileage but have been told that taking 71 is 36 miles further. However, i have taken both 71 and 502 and I think it is about the same. On 71 you do not have the curves, it is a straight shot and the danger of moose is less. Granted , the scenery isn't as good."
