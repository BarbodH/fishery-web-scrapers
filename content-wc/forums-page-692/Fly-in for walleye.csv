558935,Larry S,2006-06-28 08:11:00,666,"Tjsker,are you related to John Jerina from Illinois? If so I fished for many years at the same camp Silver Birch near Redditt, Ontario that he went to. In answer to your question I have been going on fly-in's for 25 yrs,the last 5 to Northern Outposts flying from Armstrong,which is 140miles from Thunder Bay. Great fishing,on 6 lakes. Just came back Sunday from Windsor Lake,had terrible weather for 3 1/2 days ,but still caught tons of walleye and pike.Website is www.northernoutposts.ca Can give you more detailed info on phone,just email me at [email protected] if interested Larry S"
558941,phishfearme,2006-06-28 12:11:00,1242,larry - welcome back! can't wait to hear your detailed report on windsor and your other venture. we depart for bow lake monday. - bob
558958,tjsker,2006-06-29 09:01:00,301,Any recommendations on what lake to fish? I like this outfitter because their post is closer to Nebraska than the others I've seen.
558960,Mr. Walleye,2006-06-29 09:54:00,74,"I second Larry on Northern Outposts. We just got back from Blackbirch Lake where the fishing was awesome. We caught a bunch of 18-22 inch walleyes right off the dock! Biggest walleye for the week was just under 27"". We didn't fish for them, but got several pike over 35"" with the biggest pushing 40. Our weather was constantly changing, but it didn't seem to affect the fishing much. Ryan & Kathy are taking over another great outpost next year, so if you contact them soon, you may be able to get a date in June. Their number is (807) 583-1184. I wouldn't wait to contact them!"
558970,walleye_freddie,2006-06-29 17:29:00,10,"We were going to Chimo Lodge (chimo.com, I believe). He has several outposts, fantastic walleye fishing. After 30 years our group started dying off, moving, etc. He operates his own airline out of Red Lake, so planning is a bit easier. Take a look. Well worth it!"
559029,Larry S,2006-07-03 08:15:00,666,"Tjsker, Talked to your cousin John Jerina,he said that you usually don't go on fly-in's. Please give me an e-mail at [email protected] and send me your phone # so we can talk. I have lots of info for you on fly-in's Larry S"

558679,tjsker,2006-06-21 09:34:00,301,This was also posted on the Strictly Fishing board. I've never done a fly-in before and would like to schedule one for 2007. Where do you go for info? Will you increase your chances of a consistant catch by flying farther north? FYI - right now I plan on going with my two sons (18 & 15).
558689,thunderatwork,2006-06-21 13:48:00,79,"i just discovered this forum but from what i can tell this is a good place to start. One first has to decide what level of service do you want? I've been to fly-ins where the level of service is just like staying at totem lodge on LOTW(meals, guides,housekeeping all done for you). I've also been dropped off on a rock with a cabin and LP cylinders-everything else we had to provide. I have also heard of, but not done, the tent deals. And also done the in betweens. Where else to start? Most ares of canada have tourism agencies for their area. Also which part of which providence?"
558690,phishfearme,2006-06-21 13:57:00,1242,"go to noto.net or call 800-ONTARIO and get NOTO manual (there's one for quebec and manitoba also). find some places that look intereting or meet your needs then do a search on this board for background info. then you can make a specific post requesting info. good luck, - phish"
558696,Stu,2006-06-21 15:29:00,472,"I have been thinking of a fly-in for a couple of years now. You might check out Viking Outfiiters. I have checked into alot of them and they all seem okay, but, Viking will fly your groceries and beer in for you before you get there and he only charges the grocery bill. This seems like a pretty good deal because of the weight restrictions on the plane. Good luck - Stu"
558713,515,2006-06-22 08:19:00,254,"tjsker This one of the best places right here to start for info. You'll get lots of great advice from people that have used the outfitters and can recommend places and lakes. I have being doing fly-ins for 18 yrs now and I have found you get what you pay for, and going farther north has produced more and better quality fish. Hope this helps."
558738,jigman 2003,2006-06-22 18:53:00,981,www.matticelake.com You won't be sorry. Do a search here and read the comments. I have not heard (or experienced) any negatives yet.
558764,SOUTHARK,2006-06-23 11:57:00,9,For the kind of trip that you are looking for I would suggest Liddles fishing ...they run Makokobatan Lodge and Miminiska Lodge...I went to Makok last year and am going to Miminiska this year....the accomodations and food were top notch.... flew in on a float plane out of Nakina....it was great..... caught a bunch of fish.... Steve Liddle runs a first rate operation @ Makok....
558778,Guest,2006-06-23 15:23:00,0,"I would look at L&M Fly In. They have good cabins and excellent fishing along with their own airplanes. Check out their website and fishing reports, helpful on picking a lake. Better book now for next year as most good outfitters fill up fast. www.lmflyin.com"
558790,rpieske,2006-06-23 17:54:00,1276,"Here is the link to a great outfitter in Nestor Falls, ON, 60 miles from International Falls, MN. They have a number of lakes you can choose from and are a first class operation. I recommend them without reservation.http://www.nestorfalls.com Give my regards to Dave and Michelle Beauchene when you call."
558837,ONE TIME DAVE,2006-06-26 07:23:00,110,"Have used AWO (www.awonakina.com) for ten years. One of the best fly in operations in Ontario, if not the best. Try Kayedon, Melchett, or Kap lake. I have personal maps of these lakes and can help. Advise [email protected]."
