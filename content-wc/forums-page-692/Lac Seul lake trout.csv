The June 30 fishing report from Silver Water Wheel shows a 38"" and 27 pound lake trout from Lac seul. I guess that answers my question. NWO fishing bum should cough up some secrets, I mean advice."

We use to always debate this with the boss, saying ""there has to be some lake trout in LS"". Once one was caught, it proved there are at least SOME. A few others have been caught over the years, all of which were accidental catch while walleye fishing. Of course, in the summer months, lakers hang out around 80', somtimes up in 45'-60', but mainly deeper, and for that matter, excluding the really late ice-out years, lakers are deeper than walleyes from ice-out onward. Thus we never targeted lakers on Seul, and really were almost never fishing where these fish would be feeding in the summer months anyway. How many are in there? I think, relative to the walleye population, there are few, but if you targeted them, you may be able to pick up a couple in a day, IF YOU KNOW WHERE THEY ARE. A couple weeks ago, I guided a 37.25"" FAT laker, that I estimated was in the mid- to upper-20lb range. For the most part, in the summer, lakers are spread out over deep water (thus trolling, longlining, or downrigging are the norm) but at times, with certain conditions, or particular underwater structure, they can congregate together, making deep-jigging an effective approach. Let me tell you, if you think jigging up a 5-8lb walleye out of 20' is fun, trying jigging up a 5-8lb laker out of 60' or 70'. They hit hard, and they fight like crazy the whole way up. Often, fishing deeper rock structure for walleyes in the summer, down in the 30' rangeon LS, I will mark plenty of arcs down in the 60'-80' range, and have assumed most if not all were either ling or whitefish, but lately I've questioned whether some aren't lakers. The best time to make a guess at just how many lakers are indeed in LS, would be to target them shallow with spoons or crankbaits in October-November, but that would be illegal. It's getting darn cold out there at that time anyway, and catching a couple lakers/day wouldn't make it worthwhile to me. With all that said, there are plenty of fisheries surrounding LS, and throughout NWO which do hold a good population of lakers. NWO Fishing Bum"
