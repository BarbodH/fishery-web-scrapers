So I take lots of 3 and 4 inch white and 3 and 4 inch yellow jig bodies and an assortment of 1/4 and 1/8 ounce jigs. I tip those with worms most of the time. I catch tons of walleyes and pike on the jigs. Then pretty much an assortment just to have to back up lures consisting of a few body style baits, a few spoons, a few red devils and a few worm harness's with bottom bouncers. Thats about it for me. I'm sure other will suggest some hot lures but I usually stick with the basics to keep things lite and easy. Good Luck."
