559075,wooglin,2006-07-04 20:47:00,371,Do you have camping and what are your rates? Any websites?
559076,Guest,2006-07-04 21:17:00,0,"My website is www.agatebaylodge.com check it out, and let me know if you have any questions. I could accommodate for camping, I do not have sewer facilities, so you would have to be self contained. Have boats/motors on multiple lakes. Drop me a line to talk pricing. The only way to reach me is via email this time of year. There are no phones in camp."
559079,Guest,2006-07-05 06:18:00,0,"Check out www.goldpines.com to see if they have an opening in early September. There may still be a waiting list, so be prepared. The camp owners are wonderful people who will bend over backward to satisfy. Last year their first opening was late August."
