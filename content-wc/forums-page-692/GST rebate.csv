559037,timb,2006-07-03 11:31:00,2,What is the easiest way to apply for the rebate? We won't have time to stop and apply at the border this year. Has anyone applied on-line or via mail? Thanks for your help.
559040,EyeBanger,2006-07-03 12:49:00,23,"We sent in our info by snail-mail a couple of years ago. As I recall, it took several weeks to process (possibly 6 weeks?), but we received the check. I believe that you have the option of having it sent in U.S. funds. Our experience with getting the refund at the border has been that it takes about 20 to 30 minutes. We are about ready for a break at that time, anyway, so we normally take care of it right there."

559045,Guest,2006-07-03 16:04:00,0,"Most of the camp operators have the form for you if you do not want to stop at the border. Several years ago, we had the misfortune of throwing a rod in one of the vehicles. We had to leave it up in Red Lake, rent a car to come home and then take the rental car back several weeks later. I always needed a reason to go back to fish. The garage that did the auto repair had the form ready for us when we came to pick up the car. Oh, by the way, I begged the police to give me a parking ticket in Sioux Lookout. I needed a reason to go back. He just said, ""Have a nice day"". Just wasn't my day."
559046,Lovetofish,2006-07-03 16:08:00,458,"http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/travel/visitors-e.html This is how I apply. You should be able to print it off this site. The last couple years they paid me back in CAD funds, even though it is documented and signed by the resort that I paid US dollars. They shorted me the exchange rate."
559052,tly,2006-07-03 21:42:00,1900,The address you get from internet routes it to a 3rd party. In 2 of 3 recent years we have had to exchange all sorts of iformation to get the job done. We are paid ina check drawn on US funds at the 'current' exchange rate. From 4 weeks to 6 months has been the norm.
559082,Lovetofish,2006-07-05 09:34:00,458,The form you download from this site is the same form available at the Visitors Information Bureau. I filed in August last year and my rebate check was processed on September 9th from Canada Customs and Revenue Agency.
