510265,Guest,2000-12-11 20:45:00,0,We fill our limits out to the letter of the law. We have caught fish on this lake for generations. A bunch of spoiled yuppie Yankees with self serving interests running around in high powered boats drinking beer calling me names is a laugh. We scratch out a living just like everyone else. Most of the walleye ect goes to the US where the real money is made on it. If we did not catch those walleye and feed you yanks who would.
510272,BD,2000-12-11 23:03:00,739,Lots of fighting going on here! I hope this doesn't add to it. I have one not so simple question to ask. Why can't the govenmental/natural resource representatives from both sides of the border get their heads and misplaced pride out of their collective ###'s and pass uniform regulations which allow sportsmen to use the resource wisely and still protect the lake for the future?
510273,Guest,2000-12-12 06:57:00,0,"Thats a good question. There have been talks and joint operations taking place with the D.N.R. and the M.N.R.. Lately, the D.N.R. proposed new regulations in regards to walleye limits and sturgeon harvest limits. The proposal was out there to make the limits the small enough for an angler to still experience a shore lunch and stay within the allowable harvest.The regualtion was overwhelmingly dissmissed by the general public in Northern Minn. The public and tourism want to keep the limit at 6 per day on the U.S.A side.So yes, to your question, are they talking? Was it worth it?Hopefully over time there will be common regulations. The sturgeon harvest and size limit is now upon us and it will be interesting to see if Minn. comes close to the Canadian size limit, so uniform regulations will be utilized. The difference right now is about 50 lbs/ Minn. = 45"" total length fishOnt. = 45"" total length of fillet/ from edge of gill plate, to base of tail: aproximately 77"" fish.Jeff"
510271,Guest,2000-12-13 11:58:00,0,Thank you for the answer. I thought I was asking a simple question about the status of the regulations. I didn't intend to start a border war...TGG
510274,gofish,2000-12-13 17:05:00,24,"Here in Manitoba, the dept. of Fisheries has has always adopted a proactive approach to managing our fisheries. Better to implement laws ahead of time before the damage is done. It is also a fact that Manitoba is looked upon quite favourably by our neighbors in Sask. & Alberta when it comes to the ""proactive approach. Look at what Alberta is doing with their walleye fishery. They figured it out several years ago that the lakes could not sustain the unreal pressure that was occurring there. Guess what??? The walleye fishing is bouncing back big time in many, many lakes. I say...Hats off to Ontario for recognizing the need for more conservation. I don't care if you're from Canada, the US or wherever. A fisherman is a fisherman wherever he comes from. The fact is that Rainy Lake & region offer world class fishing to many of our good neighbors to the south. Who wouldn't want to fish there? I know I would & I'm from Winnipeg. Add in better roads, better fishing technology, better access to information, it equals more fishermen...period! Hey MIFISH.....I don't for a minute believe you represent the majority of US fisherman that are welcome in Canada every year. Keep your useless, self-serving attitude at home!!"
510266,Guest,2000-12-14 15:00:00,0,"Isolationism has been the only savior from a huge consumer society across our border. If we do not protect our fish, where will you go to fill your already bloated bellies with valuable and vulnerable fish. Walleye can no longer be considered a food fish. Angling itself must be considered a recreation not food gathering or in many cases hording. We would be glad to see the meat fishermen go someplace else! Remember, it is almost impossible to do it at home. Think about it."
510275,Guest,2000-12-14 15:17:00,0,"I totally agree with you. I guide dozens of parties each year on Rainy. All may clients are from the States and I like to call all of them true sportsmen. My customers rarely harvest fish but the most important point is most of my clients are from the southern states. What does that tell you? Their conservation and fishing philosophy are much different from those who live in Northern Minn. These folks appriciate being able to catch fish as a recreation. They applaud Ontario for their actions. Believe me their are a lot more Americans in favour of all the regulations than the pultry few in the upper mid west who would rather destroy the fishery than protect it. Take a lesson from your southern brothers, true sport anglers!"
510276,lgomarko,2000-12-15 10:55:00,3,"Checkout Bob Jensen's survey found at the Midwest message board.This gives a very good indication of how the vast majority of fishermen feel about fishing regulations and limits. The true US sportsfishermen want to catch fish, and we want to catch quality fish, whether we keep them or not seems irrelevant."
510277,Frank from TBay,2000-12-15 11:33:00,312,"I like the looks of that survey. One of the problems we have here in the north is that people behave differently when it is not their backyard. This was common years back, but with education and enlightenment we are fully realizing that this area is as fragile as any other area. Good fishing: Frank"
510268,Frank from TBay,2000-12-01 15:52:00,312,"Excellant post. Local fisherman now are organizing or have organized and are trying to speak as one common voice. This is a good thing. Tourist outfitters provide a good deal of employment for seasonal workers in this area and the problems are multiple. However US tourism is not the only income generator in this area,as some of the last years post seem to think.If you are fishing in this area please check your regs on the lake you are fishing. They are changing very quickly. Our enforcement guys have a zero tolerance for infractions and you will be charged. I am very pleased that our Provincial Goverment has increased the enforcement in this area and increased our fines. The meat hunter/fisherman is a thing of the past, or it should be.Oh by the way....... if you have something to add to this discussion please do it civilly.Some of the posts on the GeneralDiscussion are unreal. Good fishing: Frank"
510258,Dan,2000-12-03 09:58:00,325,"I'm not sure what your point is. It certainly doesn't speak directly to any of the points smrainy has made.When you want to catch alot of fish you go up to Canada. When you want alot of meat to take home you'll stay at a campground or resort on the US side of any of the boundary waters in NW Ontario.It been like this for years. Its clearly Canada's long standing leadership in conservation fishing that is making all the difference in the quality of fishing in these areas.Fishing is many things for many people. I like catching alot of fish in a beautiful wilderness setting. I enjoy eating fish too but if all you're about is taking a trunk-load of fish home ... what resort owner needs that?I don't believe that most Americans staying at resorts care about filling the freezer. These fine people are up here to enjoy the Canadian outdoors.Conservation fishing practices do make a big difference to the environment and quality of the experience for the true outdoors person.Go ahead, enjoy a meal of your favourite fish and always let the big ones go, eh?"
510259,smrainy,2000-12-03 11:12:00,4,"I have about 99.9% of my guests coming from the states. half my clientel have been with me though all of these changes, and agree totally with what direction MNR is going. As a resort owner we enforce catch and release on sm and our slot size is approx. 14-18 inches on walleye {which is basically saying it is c & r}i had 450 guests last year and we only filleted 8 walleyes. Can my counterparts on the US side of the lake claim that. Getting back to the regulations. If the development on the US side would stop, we probably wouldn""t need such regs. But we drop limits, put in sanctuaries, have small slot sizes, all to help the the fish population. Right now there is a ongoing discussionin Int""l Falls about lowering limits on rainy lake from 6. From what I here and read it is not going well. The people of northern mn have to realize that the fish stocks need to be protected. The ""cooler"" days are over."
510260,Guest,2000-12-11 01:39:00,0,"You only filleted 8 walleyes heh??? You guys must have a great badminton, horseshoes and lawn jarts program. If people can't come to Canada and enjoy a meal of walleye once or twice and NOT take any home WHY would I WANT TO COME TO YOUR LODGE??? Go ahead and play your silly isolationist game, I'll go to Lake Erie and catch a couple walleye for eating if you Canadiens have gill-netted the place to death while selling them back to the U.S, at 7.96 (US) a pound. Two can play this silly hypocritical game."
510269,Guest,2000-12-11 01:43:00,0,WHY are the posts ALWAYS UNREAL when they don't agree with what you are saying??? IS GOD from Canada or something????
510270,Frank from TBay,2000-12-11 06:41:00,312,MIFISH....God is everywhere. We're getting close to Christmas so his job gets a little harder now. It is a sad time for some of us who have lost close ones. Have a nice day. Frank
510261,Guest,2000-12-11 15:11:00,0,Huh? Who ##### on your corn flakes today?
510263,smrainy,2000-12-11 18:49:00,4,"one question. If there was a lake on the texas and mexico border. Texas owned 80% of the lake and mexico 20%. Texas stopped development on it'sside of the lake in the late 60's. Mexico, kept developing and selling property, and even now is still developing resorts on it's side of the lake( only 20%). Now, if in texas the dnr was keeping tabs on the amount of mexican based fisherman, fishing in texas waters. Now, if after years, the amount of mexican based fisherman was doubling every year. If there was undue stress by mexican based fisherman. If the dnr did a study and found that 80% of all the fish caught and kept in texas waters (80% of the lake) where going back to mexico everyday. If the dnr for years have changed regulations to curb the doubling of pressure by a foreign country. For example, dropped limits, put in 7 fish sanctuaries, shortened seasons, and put in a slot size. Pressure has been put on the dnr by residents and business owners who for years have been swallowing these changes all because there is no stop in development on the mexico side (only 20%). If you were forced to drop your walleye limit to one, because of a change in the nafta agreement and you knew the pressure would be greater than a sustainable level by the mexican side and mexico left there's at 6. And if you were from texas, WHAT WOULD YOU DO? This is what we dealt with for years. The netting, well it's a native issue and as you know, there is nothing we can do. There has been no non-native netting for years."
510262,Guest,2000-12-11 18:50:00,0,"I just can't stand that ""holier than thou"",""I need your money but you will play by MY rules cause I'm GOD Attitude coming from a socialist country like Canada, where the goverment makes all the decisions and taxes the crap out of their citizens, while the electorate rolls over and tells you how good it is."
510264,Guest,2000-12-11 19:01:00,0,"Yup, my friend you are right. You have just described the Lake Erie situation to a tee. What you forgot to mention is the U.S. is a gutless country made up of gutless politicians who won't stand up against the fish RAPING Canadiens and stop allowing importing of walleye fillets to the commercial U.S. market. I guess the U.S. only embargos cigars from Cuba Heh? God forbid if we should upset the pompous Canadiens and there cash cow walleye gill netting program on Lake Erie. Might cause an international incident and upset the po' babies north of the border and hurt their feelings."
510249,Guest,2000-11-27 15:46:00,0,Is the 2001 limit on Rainy Lake still going to be 1 walleye per day for US Citizens staying at Canadian resorts? Anyone have the 2001 regs. TGG
510250,Frank from TBay,2000-11-27 18:12:00,312,I have heard the same thing. There is talk of increasing the area of lower limits to US citizens even farther into Canada if you are not staying at resorts. The MNR has also been talking about complete restriction to US residents for camping on Crown Land. They want Non residents to stay at resorts. Good fishing: Frank
510252,Guest,2000-11-29 12:45:00,0,"Sounds like Canada, has the same disease as South Dakota, eliminate the lower middle class, and cater to the rich. Yes, I know, they need to make a living, but it sure is tough on those of us who can't justify spending $500-$1000 on a fishing or hunting trip."
510253,chrism,2000-11-29 17:28:00,429,That is B.S. man!What about those of us who prefer camping in remote campgrounds?I think I'll stay here in Manitoba.
510254,Guest,2000-11-30 10:25:00,0,"I guess I should have been more clear, I was refering to the ban on camping to non-residents, the fishing limits mean nothing to me. If I have to stay at a resort, I will no longer be able to enjoy the great outdoors that Canada offers. I have always thought of Canada as a beautiful and friendly place. I'm sure it will remain that way, even if I'm not able to visit, many of us will miss these visits because we can't afford to stay at a resort. The power of the almighty dollar never ceases to amaze me, especially in the US. Yes, I know I'm sulking, and that I'm being selfish, but it hurt when my trip to South Dakota hunting became to expensive for me and now my fishing trip has a possibility of going down the tube as well. Whine, whine, whine!!!"
510267,Guest,2000-11-30 19:04:00,0,"There are no changes to the regulations on Rainy Lake for the year 2001. With the fishing pressure increase on the fishery in Ontario's side of the lake, the regulation of 1 fish per day and 4 in possesion will stay in effect. There is a major concern of over-fishing rebounding fish polulation's. The walleye take is over exceded the alocation, already once again. We are removing as many fish out of the lake as during the crash years of comercial harvest, (1950-1960's). It no longer matters, if you stay at a resort or not. The limits are the same to all non-residents regardless.The crown land camping is being exaimined further, for only during the deer hunting season, which is now bein looked at, due to the two fold increase in non-resident hunters every year. Although many locals are distured over the whole situation, mainly due to the major increase in outpost camps being taken over and bought up by private non-resident groups, that have over powering success at closing off the area to use at their own discression. It is a tremendously tough situation lately and the regular folk's who camp, are caught in the middle. Things will get plenty worse, untill the issue of land access is properly dealt with. There are some tough issue's facing the local population in N.W.Ont. Hopefully they will iron out over time, once the main issue is corrected.Jeff"
510251,Xplorer,2000-11-30 20:00:00,244,"Frank, I have gone up to the Armstrong area off and on for the last 10 years, and my in laws have been going for over 25 years. Have fished several lakes on the Obonga river system and was wondering if this area was being considered for closure also. I remember a few years ago there was talk of extending the ""red-zone"" as it was called back then. I know my in -laws are planning on going up next June and wanted to tell them to keep an eye on any new regs adopted by the MNR if that area might be included. They stay in their pickup camper on a lake with no resorts, only access is by a very primitive logging road ( the scratches on my boat/truck will attest to that :D ). Thanks for any info. Xplorerp.s. Would you know if the couple that ran the store/bait shop at Kab Lake are still in business? I know they were thinking of closing/retiring before and with the closure of the spring bear season I thought maybe that was the last straw. Good luck on the ice!!"

510256,smrainy,2000-12-01 11:44:00,4,"I am a resort owner on the canadian side of Rainy Lake.Rainy Lake is our greatest jewel and our biggest curse. (jewel) It is a lake that is approx. 240 thousand acres (# 49 in the world) with beautiful protected shorelines (mostly on the canadian side) and a fish population that is coming back like gangbusters because of our regulations. (curse) Everybody and there dog wants to come. If there were no regulations controling the number of people accessing such a body of water or on the development of the shorelines this great body of water would be fished out and the wilderness adventure would be lost. If you look at all of nw ontario, it is the very same thing.We have millions of acres of wooded areas and approx. 300,000lakes. If we had no regulations of where people go and what they do there would be nothing left. Can you imagine during a high forest fire season, for example. There are 300 million people just south of us, who have devastated there wilderness's.why would we get flack for trying to protect our own."
