510171,chrism,2000-11-07 18:08:00,429,Bad timing if you are after walleyes - Most provinces close their season from the end of March 'till early/mid May.
510172,Guest,2000-11-07 20:51:00,0,"That early you may run into closed seasons. Where are you comong from and what range do you have? During the time frame you mention, if you are coming from midwest suggest you lower your sights to crappies/perch. Lots of action = or better eating.Rainy River and LOW are good choices. Nestor Falls has some great crappie fishing. There are several year round resorts in the area that could accomodate you. One is Laquer's (spelling?) We have been there many times and Dan takes good care of us.The sports shows are soon coming which can provide openings even yet this year. If you ar close to one check it out.TLY"

Have a fly in trip on a ""sea plane"" to your own lake. No one there except your party with a nice cabin for around $900.00 U.S. per person. Ontario is where I go....If you would like to have the name and web page for the outfitter I use email me and I will get you the info. I can send pics of Large fish caught this last year also. EM"
