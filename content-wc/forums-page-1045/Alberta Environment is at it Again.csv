Alberta Environment, under the leadership of Halvar Jonson, has established a local advisory committee to make recommendations for the Evan Thomas Area Management plan. This committee includes a number of user groups including Calgary Area Outdoor Council, Kananaskis Improvement District, Kananaskis Area Residents for Economic and Environmental Sustainability, Alberta Economic Development, Environmental/Naturalists, and Alberta Environment. Nowhere, however, did I see mention of a hunter/angler group. It would seem that once again Alberta Environment has stacked the deck to achieve the results they want. We need to mount another extensive letter writing campaign or we are very likely to lose another huge piece of our hunting heritage. Jonson did it to us in the Spray Valley and it looks as though we are headed down the same road with the Evan Thomas. Jonson used the excuse for Spray Valley Park that it was the recommendation of the committee and that all users had ample opportunity for input. I suspect he'll do the same with the Evan Thomas unless we start screaming foul right now.Please write letters and get everyone you know to write letters to Jonson, Klein and your MLA expressing your concern over the way sportsmen are being excluded from critical decision making in areas where they are very important users.T.J.
