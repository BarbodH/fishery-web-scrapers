I thought you were steering clear of that area if I recall your previous posts(or maybe I'm confusing you w/ someone else). Anyway, a friend of mine did well on the French this year.Fuzzy grubs and worm harnesses were the baits of choice. 4 of them caught 60-70 eyes w/ a 10 lb the biggest. I think they fished the river east of hwy 69. I've heard thru the grapevine that it is making a comeback of sorts. maybe the 15-25 inch slot limit has something to do w/ it. Good luck. Hope this helps."

We stay at the Casa Blanca Lodge. www.casablancalodge.com . Brian and Liz own the lodge and it is first rate. The fishing for Pike, Musky and walleye is pretty spectacular. We take my 19' Astro bassboat up. If you are knowledgeable about reading a chart and or GPS you should have no problems with the countless shoals and rocks. Brian will take you out for a cruise to show you his favorite spots and how to get to them safely. The lodge is 1 mile upstream from the first dam on the lower french. For me to run to Nippising is 12 miles. About 11 minutes on flat water, but why hurry enjoy the scenery. Thier # is on thier website. They will get back to you if you leave a message. Tell them Dave from Columbus told you to call!"
