510329,Guest,2000-12-16 12:29:00,0,"Jimbo,I used to fish it in early June.Stayed at Tobin Lake Resort. We never had low water problems, but it can be a factor getting in and out of the harbor, there, that time of year.We caught the most fish west. We caught some nicer walleyes out in main lake (east)in the Elk Island area (an underwater hump).Lotsa logs floating around that time of year as waters rise. Be Careful!Tore up several props., and the skeg !Fast fishing for walleyes, but not as many ""pigs"" as in fall."
