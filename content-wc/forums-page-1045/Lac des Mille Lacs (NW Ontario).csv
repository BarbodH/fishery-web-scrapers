510233,Frank from TBay,2000-11-21 20:52:00,312,Winter creel results are in from last years study by our fish club in conjunction with the MNR. Seems about 12000 walleye were caught on the lake in the winter. The makeup of fisherman was 95% Canadian. The lake is closed to all fisherman for the last month of icefishing.LDML has the distinction that Canadians fish it mostly in the winter and nonresidents in the summer. The closure happened about four years ago when the MNR went with the advise of the local advisory board who were made up of tourist outfitters and cottage owners and other Upsula business people who cater to the summer crowd. We now have proper fair representation on the board and are beginning the discussion stage for reg changes to make it fair for all users. This is a lesson to be learned by all fisherman here. Unless you are organized and watch your politicians and MNR you run the chance of losing what you enjoy. We hope for a reopening in the next season or a sharing of the closure with the summer fisherman. It will be great to be treated as an equal in my own country. Frank

510235,Guest,2000-11-25 18:51:00,0,Most Americans come to Canada with all their stuff anyways. Who cares?????
510236,Dan,2000-12-01 10:51:00,325,If this is true it will be good for the fish and great for the true sportfishing-folk. Meat fishing is what is bad for business in the long haul.
