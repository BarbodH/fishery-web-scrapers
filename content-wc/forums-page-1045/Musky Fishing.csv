510221,Guest,2000-11-19 11:05:00,0,My friend and I mainly fish in Wisconsin for Musky but next year are plnning to try Canada. I know there are alot of Musky fisherman that go to Canada every year and would love to hear where you go and what was your best trip. We would rather cast than troll and don't care about action as much as the chance at big fish. Any ideas are greatly appreciated.

510223,Guest,2000-11-20 12:20:00,0,Call 218 386 1099. Bill Sandy runs a Musky camp out of Northwest Angle MN. Bill is the best musky hunter around. He has been featured in several fishing magazines. All the pros know him. I've known him for many years. His Mom and Dad also had a camp on Monument Bay for 20 years and he is carring on the tradition. It is a small camp and you get personal service. I have seen monster fish in that area. Good luck. Tell him I told you to call. Dick Kaitz
