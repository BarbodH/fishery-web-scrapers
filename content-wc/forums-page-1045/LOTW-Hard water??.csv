Any info would be helpful, so far it's looking better than last years conditions!! Happy Holidays!P.S. Al give up already- lets go fishing!!"

The fishing report form Ballards is a good place to keep tabs as to what is going on. I would think it would be the same Nester area. Four Mile Bay has ATV and light stuff moving on it. No big heavy rigs yet. Next week it should start though as the forcast is for below zero each night this next week. Good luck fishing. Kaz"
