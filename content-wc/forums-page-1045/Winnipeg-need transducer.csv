510312,Terry,2000-12-05 21:34:00,63,Am looking for a transducer for an older model Lowrance flasher unit approx. 15-20 years old. Model LF200 or Little Green Box would fit. Don't want to throw unit away it still works. Would like to use it for ice fishing. Would appreciate any help in locating one and price. Thanks Terry
