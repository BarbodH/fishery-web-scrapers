510327,Guest,2000-12-11 08:53:00,0,Last Pine Falls report I got from a friend on Wednesday was that the sluice gates at the Powerview dam were wide open and it has not iced over above Manitou rapids. I will try and get a hold of someone at Pine Falls today and report back. Ice was starting around the Mill boat launch last weekend.On Saturday by the Selkirk airport there were about 7 shacks on the ice and by the Selkirk Steamplant there were half a dozen cars and trucks ON THE ICE. Nobody at Lockport.I'm hoping that this stretch of cold will get Pine Falls frozen as it is always a bonus to get on there before Christmas. For the last couple of years we have not been able to get onto the ice till the week between Christmas and NewYears.Even if Pine Falls ices over sometime soon I don't think it will be too productive until they slow the flow of water out. Makes it difficult to jig the bottom when the current is going like it is.Will report back if I get some info today.
