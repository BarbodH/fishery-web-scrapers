All firearm owners need a Possetion Licence by Dec. 31, 2000 but guns do not need to be registered.There are some discounts to those that register early but I for one will wait until the last minute. Maybe our idiots in Ottawa will come to their senses although I doubt it.For some more scary news about firearms in Canada, check out the news section at #####://www.theoutdoorguys.comT.J."
