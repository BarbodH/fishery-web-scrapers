510350,Guest,2000-12-14 11:14:00,0,Great area! You have to get to Hunters Bay on Lac La ronge and check out the great laker fishin as well try Pickeral Bay for big walleyes and big numbers late May to early June you can probably expect 50-100 per day of 3-7 pounders. Also check out Otter lake for good walleye fishing but they are quite a bit smaller. Ther are several outfitters where you can rent a guide and boat in the La Ronge area as Lac la Ronge is huge with lots of rocks.
