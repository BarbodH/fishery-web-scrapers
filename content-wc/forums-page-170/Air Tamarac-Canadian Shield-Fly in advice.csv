The advice I got was great, and Mike G was even good enough to talk to me over the phone. He was a huge help. So I figured I go for round two, non fishing related. This being my first fly in trip, I was wondering if anyone had any tips or advice on things theyve experienced. Things to bring that make it easier, things that were a waste of time and weight. How were the bugs on your trip? Im going the last week of August, do I need bug nets? Do I need a gun for bears? What are you using for portable fish finders and batteries? Thank you very much in advance for any advice/stories youre willing to share"

They do not charge to fly either in. I think the water was $30, all there prices are CDN. Rate to day is about 1.23 to 1.00 cdn. Charger was nice to recharge cell phone batteries and finder batteries There charger is a Honda and will run all night on a gallon of gas. Take ext cord, place charger outside. I would take 2 batteries We did not drink water from lake with out filtering or boiling."

5973594,Bstar,2018-01-30 04:21:00,564,Check out this site for a lot of info about what to pack for a fly-in. Adam Dempsey is a regular contributor to this board and has a plethora of info on his site here https://fishingoutposts.com/how-to-p...-fishing-trip/In my experience the bugs are almost non-existent in August. You will still have mosquitos in the evening but not much during the day. Good luck on your trip!
5973738,andreindy,2018-01-30 06:46:00,308,I had never seen Adam's article before....thank you Adam and thank you for posting it again. Extremely helpful....my first fly-in is in July. This article will help fill the knowledge vacuum for sure!
5973938,MrSimon,2018-01-30 08:03:00,922,"Tons of great info out there, as mentioned. Personally, here are my top pieces of advice specific to your trip:Bugs - in late August you won't notice many bugs, until dusk when the skeeters will chase you inside.Bears - you won't likely see any, and you don't need a gun, spray, or anything like that. Just put all your fish guts in a bucket and dump them across the lake. Rinse the bucket.Portable fish finder - I bought a cheap humminbird unit for $60 and converted it to run on 8 AA batteries. It worked great and lasted all week on one set of batteries.Electronics - keep it simple. A phone and and a nice aux. battery pack is all you need. Put the phone in airplane mode and it will last a long time, even while taking pics and video. The battery pack will keep multiple phones charged all week.Other little tips - take a good small flashlight ... pack clothes in layers ... don't overpack clothes ... take stuff like ziplock baggies, foil, some string, wet-wipes, a few hand towels, chapstick, sunblock, spare eyeglasses etc.Take a good first aid kit. Not an off-the-shelf kit from walmart ... pack it yourself. Take things like cold medicine, diarrhea pills, advil, tums, benadryl, super glue, bandaids ...Pack your tackle in two or three medium sized plano boxes and put them in a backpack with your first aid supplies and other essentials. Carry the pack with you on the boat.Things you don't need that many first timers take - machete, axe/hatchet, too much tackle, too much clothes, generators, solar chargers, heavy hiking boots, big flashlights, lanterns,"
