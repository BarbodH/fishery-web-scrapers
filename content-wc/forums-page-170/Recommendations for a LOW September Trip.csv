5951226,FishermanTom81,2018-01-16 17:55:00,15,"I have been staying at Tamarack Island Wilderness Lodge for about 15 years or so. I would highly recommend it! It is near Morson on an island, electric at the docks, cabins with electricity, stoves, microwaves, coffee makers, fridge, everything like home. The docks are new (Built in the last few years) and have electricity. The area Tamarack is in is nice because it is about 8 miles from Morson, the next closest resort is about 6-7 miles away, many times you only see a handful of boats in a day. I have gone up at all times of the year (May is my favorite time) but in 2016 when I went up the second week of September we had a great time. The walleye were very predictable and STACKED in some spots (Check out the picture of my fish finder below). Todd, the owner has always bent over backwards to make sure my group is happy. I would never dream of staying anywhere else. Check them out http://www.tamarackislandwildernesslodge.com/"
5951330,martinbns,2018-01-16 19:09:00,1520,There is a small cabin for sale I was looking at online that is just next to that resort.
5951418,FishermanTom81,2018-01-16 19:47:00,15,"The original owners have had that place since (I think) the 1930's. I met Spike (The heir) of the property some time in the aughts. I was lucky enough to be invited in for iced tea one day. The stories this man had were amazing. He was mostly a walleye fisherman, he just trolled Hot-N-Tots and caught almost everything in that lake. My Dad and I love the area so much we were thinking about selling the place my Great Grandpa bought in South West Michigan in 1945 (That is about 2.5 hours from me) so we could buy Spikes place (That is about 12 hours from me). That is how much we love the area."
5952122,cnsrtv308,2018-01-17 10:00:00,4,"Hi, If your looking for an awesome September trip LOTW is a great choice, and I would choose Tamarack Island Wilderness Lodge. It's out of Morson Ontario so paved roads all the way from Baudett Mn to the marina in Morson (no 30 miles of gravel like going to the angle). The camp itself is on an island which is about a twenty minute boat ride from the marina. My buddy and I have been going to Tamarack for over ten years and the fishing is incredible, have never been disappointed! Todd, the owner is a great guy. We love how flexible and accommodating he is (something not always found in lodge owners). I spent many years fishing Eagle and other Ontario lakes and have not found another body of water as productive as LOTW. As a perck if your waterfowl hunter Ontario season opens the second week of September. Last year we did a combo fishing/hunting trip it was AWESOME!"

5956410,46Harley,2018-01-19 20:42:00,149,Our group has been going to Young's Wilderness Camp for the last 6 years. It has everything you are looking for. Check it out. www.youngswildernesscamp.com You will enjoy the In-Fisherman video.
5939850,TMF89,2018-01-10 14:57:00,77,"Hey guys. So a group of fellow anglers and I have been doing a fall Devil's Lake, ND trip for the last few years, and were thinking of changing it up some. I've fished Lake of the Woods for years, but only in the spring/winter out of Baudette. I've always loved fishing Canadian Shield waters though, so I thought that maybe a trip north of the border was in order. I've done plenty of research on various camps and outfitters, and am looking for personal experiences. I'd be open to Morson, Nestor Falls, Sioux Narrows, or even Kenora. We would be looking at the first or second week of September, and would be bringing our own boats. So a place with docks/electricity for the boats would be required. Only really interested in housekeeping options, I'd like to keep it $40-80 per person a night. We'd have a group of probably 8-12 guys, so larger cabins would be a bonus, but obviously multiple smaller ones would work too. We'd mainly be targeting walleye, although I'm sure most of us would enjoy getting into bass, pike, or musky as well. A boat-in camp/outpost would be pretty cool, but obviously electricity might be a concern then. Part of the appeal of LOW is that it's a relatively remote/large lake, most of my buddies are used to fishing Mille Lacs or other crowded bodies of water. Having said that, are certain areas known for being busier/less crowded than others? I realize that it's not a remote fly-in, but fishing an area where we don't have to worry about hitting Spot B or C in order to stay away from other anglers would be nice. If we can do that in one of the southern areas, great, but that would be the primary reason I'd look at Kenora, if it's drastically less busy than the rest. Other than numbers of anglers, are there any other differences between the areas? It looks like Morson has the most big water, and Nestor Falls might be a bit more closed off, compared to the other locations, for example. Well thanks for any and all experience/opinions/advice you guys can provide, I look forward to learning from you!"

5940010,BornToFish,2018-01-10 16:10:00,1224,"Greetings,I have been fishing during mid-September in NW Ontario for at least ten years - albeit north of LOW. September is my favorite time of the season to fish on the Canada Shield.The fishing is normally phenomenal. Walleyes tend to be stacked up. I'm thinking ""game on"" when I pull up to a rock hump and catch one walleye, as I then know where they all are. The giant pike/musky bite can be sensational in the days leading up to turnover. Finding three strands of green weeds in close proximity is akin to finding a gold mine.As you mention, I also enjoy the solitude of the fishing. There are markedly fewer boats on the lake as family groups are home with children in school. Many guys are home sitting in trees with their bows/arrows. The people fishing on the lakes in Ontario tend to be ""hard core"" guys with plenty of experience.A downside of fishing in September can be the weather. I've experienced the best weather of the season, and the worst weather of the season, in the same day. Mid-September on the Canada Shield is clearly autumn weather patterns - often big winds.Another positive of fishing during September is the absence of bugs.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5941586,emma17,2018-01-11 14:03:00,436,"The guys in our group are very satisfied customers of Obabikon- this will be our 5th consecutive year. As it is Boat-In, you get the solitude you're looking for while having access to outstanding multi-species fishing all around."
5942530,Bill Krejca,2018-01-12 07:24:00,6107,September is a great time to be on LOW. Obabikon is a great place to be at. Enjoy. Bill
5942954,LOW1,2018-01-12 09:57:00,2828,"Wonderful time to be there. I am sure Obabikon would serve you well. Tomahawk and Crawfords would also in Sioux Narrows. Wind can be an issue so bring warm clothes and be prepared to fish in less open areas. (There are many islands which can help break the wind greatly)Some local restaurants, etc may be closed for the season by then so keep that in mind. Have a great trip."
5943866,martinbns,2018-01-12 19:53:00,1520,"Fishing in Sept and early Oct this year on the Canadian waters out of Kenora was great, but it was very rough and windy after labour day most weekends when we were out. Caught lots of walleye and big ones, casted for bass alot and did very well also. I don't think the camps are all that busy in september, lots of them around.http://www.fishingontario.com/kenora.html"
5944370,The tank,2018-01-13 08:49:00,340,we stay at Rex Toltons miles bay camp 2-3 times a year. It's on a island in milesbay about a 12 mile boat ride from morson I've also stayed next door to rex toltons at grassy narrows both places are great places to stay. we might actually be at milesbay the 2nd or 3rd week in September. Have a great trip.
