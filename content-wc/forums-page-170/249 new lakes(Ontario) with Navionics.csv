Little detail but better than nothing and at a buck apiece, a heck of a deal. Not many hazardous areas were shown but knowing where the deeper areas were helped travel. Even printed on plastic although a few were on paper. Years ago when I inquired why they were no longer available, I was told ""the maps don't provide enough detail"".....what a lame answer. Versus no mapping, any depth map was certainly better. Oh well."
