Theoretically we could also book a cabin in a Kenora and fish Ptarmigen Bay and south towards Ash Rapids which is much clear water. Would we be better off booking a cabin towards Kenora and if the mayfly are hatching in LOTW we go to the Winnipeg river system and fish around Minaki? Obviously hatches are driven by water temperature but does clear water make a difference? Do we need to be worried about a hatch at that time and have a back up plan in store? Newbies to Morson please help! Thanks!"

There will certainly be a mayfly hatch going on somewhere in the area during that time period. The cool thing about the Morson area is the different water temps near by. So, if there's a hatch in Miles bay, there probably won't be one going on around Sunset channel, or straight west of Morson, or Sabaskong, or Burrows Bay or further west toward rubber island.... if you're finding an area with clouds of mayflies, the easy solution is to just change areas. There's a ton of great water to fish."

I think you might have misread the part about the clear water? What I was trying to say was that near Kenora it is much more clear than Morson, meaning that Morson was more stained and less clear. Would having deeper, more clear water effect the hatch and would we be better off trying to fish that area of LOTW? Any strategies to suggest that your guests have tried when a hatch does happen? Stay home? haha thanks again"
5969834,LOWrider,2018-01-28 03:25:00,40,"Agree with Obabikon - simply find different water that doesn't have an active hatch. We never have problems finding an area to fish no matter how big the hatch. May mean boating an extra couple of miles if you arrive on a spot that has a hatch, but that's about all it takes. Last year's hatch didn't seem as big as two years ago by us (south of Morson), but could be a completely different story just a few miles away. Can't really think of LOW as one lake. Morson is actually a really neat area as it is basically the point where Prairie meets Canadian shield, so you have very different lake geography depending on which direction you drive your boat. From the mud and sand flats to the South to the deep channels and reefs to the North. Mayfly hatches (fish bugs as my neighbors like to call them) aren't something I'd lose sleep over."

We catch walleyes every single day of the year. We very rarely have extended slow periods. However, the key is to find areas that aren't currently affected by the hatch. That's it. Don't try to fish it... there is bound to be an area within 10 minutes of where you are that has no hatch at the time. Yes, I did misread your first post. Sorry."
5973362,nicko,2018-01-29 19:49:00,508,"We have never had an issue catching fish during the mayfly hatch....Here's a few tips: 1. Don't jig. Walleye are higher in the column during that time. Bottom bounce with spinners and crawlers. 2. Use gold/copper colored everything. Better color for that time. 3. Move around. No bites, move...15 min without a bite is long enough... Mid-lake reefs and humps are always winners at that time. Obabikon is right on.... Good luck!"
