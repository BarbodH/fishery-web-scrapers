5976826,Pymbet,2018-01-31 18:22:00,42,"Once or twice a year our group goes to Ontario to camp on/fish a relatively accessible small lake (not more than 1,500 acres). Over the years, we have figured out that this lake is far more productive from about one hour before sunset to 1/2 hour after sunset. I know that is not that odd, but the change in action is much more than any of the thirty plus other lakes in Ontario that we have fished over the years. Its pretty obvious that the locals think so too as the few other boats we see (you can drive up to this lake) arrive during this evening window and we seldom see any other boats during the day. We even talked to one person from the nearby town about this lake and one of his first statements was ""you probably figured out that ZZZ lake is an evening lake"".So the question is, what makes a lake an evening lake. For some background, the lake does not have any major feeder streams/rivers, has some deeper areas (up to 35 feet) and a few islands. Overall, it has decent structure. Also, our most productive technique is crawler harnessing near shore areas when evening comes around."
5977146,BornToFish,2018-02-01 05:40:00,1224,"Greetings,I fished a lake in NW Ontario that had an early morning walleye bite. This bite started at first light and was typically over by about 8:00 a.m.. The walleye bite typically resumed about ninety minutes before dark. The middle part of the day was normally a tough walleye bite. The clarity of this water was pretty good, but not gin clear. We could normally see to about twelve fow or so.I am now fishing a lake that is fairly stained. The walleye bite starts in the morning and lasts all day. We catch them during the morning, during the day and during the evening. My wife is very much enjoying the lake that we are now fishing as she does not need to get up very early for the morning bite.I wonder if water clarity is playing into the evening bite? If not, maybe something is peculiar to the forage base for the predators.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5977482,Bill Krejca,2018-02-01 08:08:00,6107,"An interesting observation. I, too, noticed that a certain portion of a lake had great fishing within the evening time mentioned, and *not so good during the day. For that portion of the lake, the great evening fishing could be chalked up to the clearer water being the reason (bait fish could see the attacker during daylight, and the walleye chose not to expend the energy to attempt to catch them, rather waited until they had a large observation advantage as the daylight diminished). The bite normally continued, albeit at a much reduced rate until farther into the night . Another portion of the lake, not many miles away, but much stained, actually cloudy, had far better walleye fishing throughout the day, but the evening time again was much better. At dark, the bite stopped entirely, apparently the reduced water clarity due to darkness was even too much for walleye eyes to overcome. Another of my observations, or rather perhaps theory, if you will, is that the bite many times depends upon the amount of fish present. When *fewer fish are present, they have more time to observe a presentation, without fear of brother George beating them to it. For this reason, they may not hit. In a more concentrated population, it can be a case of ""better grab it before another does"", a reaction mode, if you will. This could maybe partially explain the bites which can occur in clear water. I call this the ""boarding house reach approach"". this could explain the reason why a water's bite changes over the years as the fish population is thinned down, either by fishing, or netting. Other conclusions can maybe be drawn from the conditions above, but I'll save for another time. Just something to think about on a cold winter's day! Bill"
5978218,bthomas3333,2018-02-01 11:37:00,465,Just a couple of observations. Lakes where you have deeper holes and clear water tend to have Ciscos as major food source for walleyes. In these lakes the Cisco literally rise and fall in the water column during the day. Cisco's up at nightime chasing their food(plankton/bugs/small fish)...Walleyes follow...BAM! Evening bite lake. Of course Walleyes eat other stuff too but if they have a choice it will be bigger better food source. An exception might be Big storm/rain washes in worms or blows leaches out deeper....low pressure overcast day....Better day bite even in clear water. Heavily stained lake where the major food source is small perch/minnows....less large fish better numbers lake bc of low count Cisco/whitefish. You will often get a day bite. The smaller fish in higher numbers have to be more aggressive and take the food when they can get it. When I hear folks taking about catching walleyes shallow in the weeds I see this kind of lake. I used to fish a heavily stained lake North of Red Lake. The walleyes hung out on the rock reefs all day. Maybe a little deeper or shallower and they loved Orange / Orange tiny jigs 1/8oz and small spinners. They were used to eating peach or maybe crayfish or maybe they could just see the orange better.Another lake I fish is deep and clear. The walleyes basically eat from about 8p to 6a. They want a large minnow no dressing either on a glow white head or pink with no tail just a minnow. In fact they also like a minnow on a floating jig with a shot to get down. They are eating different food.My observations...for what its worth.B
5978682,Pymbet,2018-02-01 15:07:00,42,"I appreciate the observations and the knowledge shared. I can see a lot of what was mentioned above in this lake. First, it is relatively clear, and is certainly not a stained lake so that could be a factor keeping them deep during the day.Second, the overall population of walleye is not high, so the lower competition/selective nature of the fish aspect also fits well. The lake has enough walleye to keep it interesting and keep us coming back, but it is certainly not loaded. As far as the forage base, I am not sure about that. But I am going to read up on ciscos to see if I can figure that out next summer. Also, its clear that we need to focus on the deeper holes if we are going to fish it during the day and I like the large minnow white/pink head recommendation.One of the great things about this lake is it sits within a mile of our favorite pike only lake. So we usually just head over to it during the day and catch pike until 5:00 or so and then head back to our walleye lake to catch dinner. A problem with an ""evening lake"" is you catch your fish late and then have to cook/eat under lantern light. If you want to eat earlier, that means the fish from the previous day. Some of the guys I go with love their fresh walleye meal, so its usually in the dark. Could be worse problems in life!"
5978818,yoopertrout,2018-02-01 17:12:00,1172,"This makes sense. I've heard walleye ice fisherman say that they stay into the dark on clear lakes, but not stained ones."
