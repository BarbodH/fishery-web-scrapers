The chip in your passport contains the personal contact information found on the photo page of your passport, including your picture, but that's it."
5974426,Andre (wallyandre),2018-01-30 11:21:00,2274,They won't refuse or denied entry w/o any good reason
5974490,MrSimon,2018-01-30 11:44:00,922,"True. But the definition of ""good reason"" is subjective and 100% in the hands of the agent."
5974506,Andre (wallyandre),2018-01-30 11:48:00,2274,Like I already mentionne: I cross the border 60-80 times per year for the last 22 years and I never had any problem; I don't coun't a problem to be sent to the secondary and get search. A lot of my friends are also crossing the border very often and none of them have been deny entry just because the officer was feeling bad that morning.
5974554,MrSimon,2018-01-30 12:01:00,922,I don't think agents deny people on a whim either ..... this discussion was based on the person having a somewhat severe item on their record and crossing for the first time. That's when things get complicated and the judgment of the agent plays a large role.
5974626,Andre (wallyandre),2018-01-30 12:38:00,2274,That why I propose that he fill-up the documentation prior to crossing and if they allowed him he just bring the documentation with him and he won't have any problem but if he don't do that prior he may be send back home.
5974698,Obabikon,2018-01-30 13:41:00,2370,"My ""it depends"" had much more to do with the nature of the crime than the whims of the officer. I have had thousands of guests come up in the past 12 years. I've never had someone with documentation turned away because the officer didn't like what he saw. Officer discretion is absolutely a thing. However, the officer is going to have to explain the reason why they turned someone away. In fact... their job security would depend on it. There would be very few officers willing to risk losing their job, just because they didn't like someone."
5974874,Andre (wallyandre),2018-01-30 15:46:00,2274,X2!
5972186,leachmin&worm,2018-01-29 10:55:00,32,"Planning a trip to Canada, again. This time i'm bringing one of my sons along that hasn't gone fishing in a while.He has served 30 days in lock-up as an adult (19) for a conviction of cannabis and paraphernalia. He is clean now, working and doing much better. Question: Can he cross the border with me for this fishing trip? He has a passport.Just found out, he is on probation until he pays off fines in the amount of $500. I doubt he can cross."
5972474,Obabikon,2018-01-29 13:20:00,2370,"The easy answer is... ""it depends"". How long ago was it? What was the actual conviction classified as (felony or misdemeanor)? Has he had anything else on his record?"
5972522,Mojo-NC,2018-01-29 13:36:00,1929,"We had one of our guys detained at the border going into Canada several years ago because he had a DUI on his record. They eventually let him through because his arrest was more than 5 years prior to our entry. However, on our return flight, there was a guy across the isle from me on the plane who had just been denied entry due to a fairly recent DUI. He had to turn around and go home the same day he flew up to International Falls. I can't say whether they will treat the incident you refer to differently or not. They are very picky about these types of convictions. I would call them and ask about your specifics. Good luck."
5972578,Obabikon,2018-01-29 13:53:00,2370,"Always a good idea to go over the specifics with an immigration officer (one from the border you are crossing is best). They did relax some of the DUI laws, but that goes back into felony vs. misdemeanor. In Canada a DUI is a felony, and some drug convictions are misdemeanors."
5972658,Andre (wallyandre),2018-01-29 14:16:00,2274,Some readings and infos:the last one may be the one in your friend's casehttps://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/travel-v...nc-eng.html#a3https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration...nvictions.htmlhttps://www.canada.ca/en/immigration...ctions.html#a2
5972714,zalman,2018-01-29 14:31:00,219,"You definitely should apply for a eTA (electronic travel authorization) before you go. Otherwise you could get turned around at the border at the discretion of the immigration officer.The ""it depends"" answer is absolutely correct. Did he get his passport before or after the conviction? If it was after, he might be ok. But I would still check before you go and avoid a possible issue."
5972858,Andre (wallyandre),2018-01-29 15:36:00,2274,Everything is crystal clear on this document:https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration...ty.html#5312E4
5972954,Paul H,2018-01-29 16:02:00,1232,"I'd check - especially since this would not be considered criminal in Canada, unless ""dealing"". was convicted of an offence outside of Canada that is considered a crime in Canada; or committed an act outside of Canada that is considered a crime under the laws of the country where it occurred and would be punishable under Canadian law."
5973954,MrSimon,2018-01-30 08:15:00,922,"Truth!!! It doesn't matter what any documentation says, or what conversations you have ahead of time .... everything is up to the discretion of the border agent when you get there. I have crossed when they barely even looked at the passports and waived us through in less than 30 seconds .... they didn't run anything through the system. I've also had times when they detained us for an hour and went through everyone's background with a fine toothed comb."
5974058,Andre (wallyandre),2018-01-30 08:46:00,2274,"If you got something on your record I strongly suggest to fill-up all the recommanded papers and documents. If after doing so your eleigible to cross the border there is absolutly no reason to be denied entry except if your impolite, don't want to answer questions etc... I cross the border 50-60 times a year back & forth and I do have friends that are border officer in the US and in Canada."
