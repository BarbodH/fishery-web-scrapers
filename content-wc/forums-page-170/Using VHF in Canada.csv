5976282,big popi,2018-01-31 11:53:00,635,I did some searching about using a VHF radio while in Canada and got conflicting information. Does anyone know what (if any) requirements to operate while in Canada?
5976658,Pooch,2018-01-31 16:25:00,4618,"I believe it's the same rules (law) as in the USA.Biggest thing to keep in mind is that Marine VHF are business working frequencies with some pleasure craft assigned certain channels. Radio traffic is sometimes monitored by various agencies along with other commercial users. That means no cursing, etc.. It gets abused at times, but in general just say what needs to be said and get off the microphone. Most users monitor the assigned channels in case of an emergency in their area that they could be of assistance. Many folks never talk on their marine band radio, but monitor it for fishing ""tips"" from chatty boats.Channels are assigned for a particular use. Observe this rule.https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...d.php?t=655730Maybe this will help.Pooch"
5976834,stjoeguy,2018-01-31 18:37:00,979,"My understanding is that a license is required. How and whether it is enforced is another question. This is from the following website:https://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/marinesafet...or-1610.htm#s7Requirements for Foreign Recreational Boaters in Canadian Waters Marine VHF Radio VHF Radio Marine VHF radio is the recommended means of issuing a distress alert. If you have a marine VHF radio, keep it tuned to channel 16. Know where you are at all times and be prepared to describe your location accurately. In case of grave and imminent danger (for example, your boat is taking on water and you are in danger of sinking or capsizing) use channel 16 and repeat ""MAYDAY"" three times. Then give the name of your vessel and its position, the nature of your problem and the type of assistance needed. Remember: Channel 16 is used for EMERGENCY and CALLING purposes only. If possible, take your conversation to a working frequency once you have called another vessel on channel 16. Anyone who uses a VHF radio must follow the procedures described in the VHF Radiotelephone Practices and Procedures Regulations. Currently, all VHF radio operators are required to have a Restricted Operator's Certificate (ROC) with maritime qualifications. Canada recognizes the American Certificate. For more information on the ROC, contact the Canadian Power & Sail Squadrons (CPS) toll-free at: 1-888-277-2628. Visitors from a country other than the United States should contact Industry Canada for more information."
5977026,Pooch,2018-01-31 20:38:00,4618,You do not need a marine band license if you are under a certain size craft. That would be most all pleasure boats.http://www.offshoreblue.com/communic...o-operator.phpPooch
5977074,Guest,2018-01-31 23:32:00,0,I don't see the part that says these things apply to Canada. Did I miss that?
5977130,Shellback,2018-02-01 05:23:00,8083,"These are US regulations, not Canadian"
5977210,big popi,2018-02-01 06:08:00,635,"Pooch, Thanks for the advice. We do use VHF all the time while on the river. We always use the recreational channels (even though some tow-boat captains do not follow this rule) and are courteous and refrain from foul language while on the radio. My specific question was if a license is required to operate. thanks Brian"
5977938,Pooch,2018-02-01 10:23:00,4618,"After April 1999, VHF Radios on pleasure boats are no longer 'required' to have a ship station licence within Canadian waters due to changes to the Industry Canada Radiocommunications Regulations (Section 15.2 Exemption of Radio Apparatus on Board a Ship). (You do not need a ship licence or operator certificate to use FRS or CB radios on a boat.)From this website: http://boating.ncf.ca/vhf.html#operatorlicenseShip Radio Station LicensingLicensing Requirements Do I need a licence for the marine radio equipment on board my vessel? You will not require a licence if you meet both of the following criteria: the vessel is not operated in the sovereign waters of a country other than Canada. the radio equipment on board the vessel is only capable of operating on frequencies that are allocated for maritime mobile communications or marine radio navigation. You can verify whether the frequencies you use are in the maritime mobile band by referring to Regulation by Reference RBR-2. If you do not meet both of the above criteria, you will require a radio licence. You can contact your local Industry Canada office for more information. All of the Industry Canada offices can be found in RIC-66.The above taken from:http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/smt-gst...h_sf01775.htmlThe above parallels what a MNR guy told me several years ago. Not that he was the right guy to ask, but he was standing there talking to me.Pooch"

5978546,Pooch,2018-02-01 14:01:00,4618,Quite a few years ago I was told same maritime rules on both sides of the border and without reading documents I don't totally understand it appears to be true. They just say the same thing in a different way.Pooch
