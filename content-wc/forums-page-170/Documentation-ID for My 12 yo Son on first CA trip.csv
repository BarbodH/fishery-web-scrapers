She asked me to roll the windows down in the back seat and said ""sir if you don't mind allowing your child to answer the questions"".She asked him where he was going, what were going to do, if he knew where we were staying and how long we were going to be there. When she asked if their mother knew we were going I offered the document my wife prepared.Of course his answer to where we were going was ""Canada"". She got a chuckle out of that.I understand why they do it and have no issues with it. Have the documents ready when you arrive and no issues."
5976162,Andre (wallyandre),2018-01-31 10:34:00,2274,I put a link in my post #10 of the official letter accepted by both party's. Birth certificate is not enough if only 1 parent is travelling with the child
5976290,MrSimon,2018-01-31 11:59:00,922,"Not true. I've done it multiple times and have only ever been asked for the birth certificate. I'm not saying you shouldn't have the letter, but it is ""just in case"" and not required."
5976306,Andre (wallyandre),2018-01-31 12:07:00,2274,Not require but what do you do if you are ask for it! Takes 1 minute fo fill-up! Don't forget: it all depends!!
5976946,Shortline,2018-01-31 19:53:00,234,"I have always handed over my passport(enhanced DL), my sons BC, and a notarized letter from my wife. On 15-20 or so trips per year across for the last 7 yrs that I have been taking him, I havenâ€™t had an issue entering Ontario or Manitoba. I have had a handful of agents comment that it was helpful or appreciated that I handed them the letter. My letter states that my wife gives permission for me to take our boy across at any time during the year in either Ontario or Manitoba for the purpose of fishing or hunting. Many agents have asked him(now 11yrs old) if he lived with mom and dad, if his mom was ok with him missing school to fish, .... etc, but there has never been any hassles. In the last 7 yrs, I have not made a trip up there without him....I guess he is a lucky kid(and I am a lucky dad.).Andre - thank you for that link to an official permission letter. I appreciate that -and will be updating my paperwork!"

5969298,stoneam2006,2018-01-27 14:27:00,179,My kids are 7 and 5 I brought birth cert and my enhanced licence (ny) I had no issues what so ever. I have called the customs office in Niagara falls they answered my questions. Worth the callSent from my SM-N920V using Tapatalk
5969362,Slim03,2018-01-27 15:44:00,159,I took my 9 year old last year and got him a passport card prior to going.
5969818,Guest,2018-01-28 02:00:00,0,"Just a birth certificate is all you need for your son. Another thing to strongly consider is a permission letter from your sons mother to go on the trip. Listing his name and DOB, your name, where you are going, for which days and length of time plus a contact number to reach the mother."
5969930,BornToFish,2018-01-28 06:32:00,1224,"Greetings,I also strongly encourage the original poster to have the permission letter from the son's mother, especially if he and the son have different last names. Many years ago, my wife wanted our daughter to accompany her on a trip out of the country. They were denied permission to board the plane since my wife did not have such a permission letter from me with her. I ended up faxing a letter to them at the airport, along with a copy of my passport (at 3:00 a.m.!).The mother of the original poster's son might want to have the permission letter notarized to establish authenticity.Since then, we have had such a letter with us when one of us crosses the border with a minor child (i.e. a nephew or our daughter). We haven'tbeen asked for it.I have chatted with friends that have taken a child into Canada without his/her mother. They reported that they were asked to ""come inside"" and had to wait for a period of time. They thought thy were simply being observed for ""unnatural"" behavior as an indicator of bad intentions for crossing the border.The original poster might want to coach his son that he might be singled out and asked questions. I would not encourage the original poster to volunteer a permission letter from his son's mother, but do have it at the ready.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5970378,terrapin,2018-01-28 09:14:00,353,"My wife takes one of our kids to Canada nearly every weekend (hockey), and frequently takes other players as well. Definitely get a passport. They have simpler and less expensive one for crossing through a border rather than by plane. (I was going to point out that this passport card is only good for Mexico and Canada, but I guess that's a given).I write a simple letter with ages, names, dates and reason for traveling. I also include a scan of my drivers license. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
5972466,Obabikon,2018-01-29 13:17:00,2370,The only requirement is a birth certificate. A letter explaining the trip with the dates and mom's contact info would also be helpful.
5973370,valley366,2018-01-29 19:50:00,193,I take my boys that are 9 and 12. We did full passport in case we travel elsewhere so that is what we bring to Canada and have no issues. I understand birth certificate is the minimum.I would also bring the permission letter. I was asked for it last year and the previous year my brother in law traveling with his kids was asked for it coming back into the US.Other times have traveled with my nephew. I think out of 7 years bringing him we were never asked for it.
5974002,MrSimon,2018-01-30 08:28:00,922,"I've taken kids a number of times. I took birth certificates and permission letters, no passports. Have never been asked for the permission letters .... I don't think the permission letters carry as much weight with border agents as people think they do. They are very easily forged, even if notarized. Every time I take kids, the agent makes eye contact with each child and asks for their name directly."
