Each one seems like a bonus fish as we did not catch any more than that, and we only got one on one day and the other on the next day. Has anyone ever targeted Lake Whitefish in Lac Seul and if so could you share a strategy as I think they taste wonderful. Thanks"
5962986,Pooch,2018-01-23 15:32:00,4618,"Guys do target them, but they are hard to come by is my understanding. Many times we mark huge schools of deep fish, but cannot catch one regardless of what we try. I assume those are probably whitefish.Yes, they are fun to catch when you accidentally hook up with one. They bleed easily and C&R isn't a good option for them.Some of the Canadian guys here will have an answer for you.Pooch"
5963018,BornToFish,2018-01-23 15:34:00,1224,"Greetings,I haven't fished Lac Seul, so can't comment on targeting whitefish on this body of water. I have however caught whitefish on nearby lakes.Like you mentioned, I have caught random whitefish during the first week of the season on jig + minnow combinations when fishing near shore. Some of these whitefish have been impressive in size (6-7 lbs or so). I have also caught them during the autumn while targeting walleyes in twenty or so fow. I believe these autumn whitefish were staging in front of known spawning areas, as they spawn in late autumn.I've never caught a whitefish during the summer season in shallow water. However, we have caught them over deep water during the summer. We rely upon our electronics to locate them in the main lake basin - say 40-60 fow. We just tipped some Swedish Pimples with minnow heads and jigged just above them.I often fish for whities through the ice. It's akin to playing with kittens as we play to the whitie's inherent curiosity. The bite can be aggressive, but is typically very subtle, as the fish lifts the bait up into it's mouth. They are very spirited once hooked!Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5963066,BornToFish,2018-01-23 15:37:00,1224,"Greetings,One more thing to mention in regards to whitefish. They are very tasty table fair when eaten fairly fresh. They do not freeze well, as they become somewhat ""rancid"" tasting when left in the freezer for more than a few weeks. I've heard this phenomenon from others. This has also been our experience.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5963834,Bill Krejca,2018-01-24 07:22:00,6107,They also can be wormy if taken from a less than deep lake. Bill
5964362,prov1800,2018-01-24 11:41:00,5010,The colder the water the better.warmer water seems to make there meat mushy.excellent to fry up and even better yet smoked.
5967370,tv4fish,2018-01-26 06:44:00,2694,I believe that whitefish are (or used to be) commercially fished on parts of Lac Seul??
5967394,prov1800,2018-01-26 06:58:00,5010,Whitefish are still commercially fished on lac suel.as they are on quite a few bigger lakes like eagle lake also.they can be pretty easy to catch on a big and minnow to.great eating have caught some to do a shorelunch for something diff.everyone really seemed to enjoy them.
5975074,David Anderson,2018-01-30 17:33:00,2073,"Thanks everyone, especially BTF as I fish tullibees on Mille Lacs and they can be pulled up from 35 feet pretty easily. I like the swedish pimple and minnow head combo idea, I can look for deeper water off the reefs and see what happens. Yes they are very good fresh and very delicate. The ones we got were in the 5# range and I ended up bringing them home and having the local meat market, who does an excellent job, smoke them, absolutely the finest. I would like to get some more and will set aside a rig and see what happens. Maybe simply jigging the pimple where I catch walleyes in the spring might work for both, worth a try."
