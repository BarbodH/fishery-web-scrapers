I look forward to returning with 2 friends that have not been on that water before. Our boat in on Rainy has been great but required a 20+ miles trip in with generators,gas as well as drinking water and Ice for the week and all our other supplies. Once we reached camp carrying all the equipment and supplies up a hill was getting to be a bit of a chore for four ""older"" guys. At Big North we are not only secluded but the camp owner is there with a four wheeler to haul our larder to our Cabin that has bottled water,electricity,indoor plumbing and electricty at the docks. We started going to Rainy for the rustic experience and it was perfect for a few years but I am truly excited to be back on the Winnipeg this coming spring.The fishing,camp owners and camp facilities are absolutely top notch."

I plan to take my travel trailer and boat up to Lake Oahe in Late March or Early April, once the ice is off, to chase early northerns. I plan on leaving everything there at Codger's Cove RV Park all the way through April, May and June. It's cheap ($375 for a month, includes full hookups.) Saves me the expense of dragging my boat back and forth, and I can stay for a week at a time, with trips home to see the Mrs. and the grandson. The walleye fishing has been tough the last few years on Oahe, but we always manage to find enough to eat and take a few home. And the SMB fishing is outstanding! Some of the biggest brownies I have ever caught. And huge numbers of great 2-3 lb fish that are some of the best fighters in the water. In July I pull it all back to Colorado and start fly fishing the rivers around here and up in Wyoming. Then in September my brothers and my son and I head to Lac Seul for a week. Then in October the Kokanee Salmon are hot on Blue Mesa, here in Colorado.... And then the pheasant season opens! Good to be alive, and live in the U.S.A.!!!"

5913498,Guest,2017-12-26 16:16:00,0,"From a skills standpoint, he's just about dead even between baseball and football, but I don't think he has much more size coming to him so football is probably a HS-only endeavor...but he really enjoys it. Tough to tell him to give up part of his HS fun, especially when the coach strokes his ego. I asked the FB coach his opinion at a fundraiser a month or so ago. He said, ""go during baseball."" Pretty much expected that response. I think he'll choose baseball over football at this point because his HS football team is terrible. Actually, I take that back...they'd have to get quite a bit better to be terrible! I know my wife would be happy if he gave up football, after the two concussions he sustained last year. I'll (mostly) leave it up to him and we'll see how it goes...one way or another, I'll be heading to BBL! -42"

My problem now is when to do it...my son and I usually go the week between the end of his baseball season and the start of his football season (late July)...but he's starting to get recruited by some colleges for baseball, and the showcases and big tournaments run right up until football. Going early-season would possibly mean missing the HS playoffs. Football may have to take a break this year and we'll go up in early August? -42"

If recruiters from BB are interested that might make the choice for you and I son. What does your son think? Does his desire for fishing override a week of preseason practice? What does the FB coach say, another discussion that might be included in your decision process. Good luck make the call that seems right for you and your son!"

We are taking a motorhome to a nice campground on the Rideau system in SE Ontario. We'll fish, swim, hike, camp etc etc. I feel like my trips up North have reset. In year's past me and the guys were looking for the next amazing fly-in crazy adventure in the far far North. Now that I'm taking the kids, we are looking for panfish, bass, and small pike ... along with sandy beaches and ice cream shops. We will build up to bigger trips later. I think I'm more excited for this upcoming trip than any other trip I've taken."
5858106,fishron,2017-11-14 16:40:00,317,There certainly are some great family locations on the Rideau. This year my group will stay close to the border on a lake we've fished for a long time. A Spring trip and a Fall trip. Our lake has been producing larger walleye and pike than ever before. Not on the Rideau but a feeder to the system. We mix a little golf with our fishing these days. I keep an eye out for more northern adventures in the future.
5858170,Shellback,2017-11-14 17:55:00,8083,"I usually spend 2 weeks each June, and 2 weeks each Sept on the St Lawrence in Gananoque. When it starts to blow out of the S.W. I'll hit some back lakes on or around the Rideau system. I like to try different ones each year. So far I've fished Gananoque, Charleston, Cranberry, Opinicon, Newboro, Loughborough, Buck, Bob's and Pike. Usually get over to Quinte for a day also. Mostly been a bass or pike bite for me. Bob's has been the only lake I've caught walleye out of. Two trips to the Chapleau area in the past 3 years haven't impressed me. Not the best walleye fishing in S.E. ON, but I have ""A deal I can't refuse"" there!"
5858386,fishron,2017-11-14 21:30:00,317,"Interesting Shellback. I've fished several of the lakes you mention through the years in SE Ontario. Although the area is usually associated with bass and pike the one lake you don't mention is Wolfe. It's absolutely a natural walleye lake that's never been stocked. It's not an easy lake for anglers that don't know it but there have been times on certain trips through many years when it has rivaled anything I've seen further north except Hebert in Quebec. Being close to many people, Wolfe is a summer recreational lake. Lots of water skiers and such. But spring and fall, it's serious walleye water."

We enjoyed a successful Bear hunt at this location in 2015 and are hoping for the same again.Trip #2 will be our 16th Annual, 10 person, boys Spring fishing trip at Five Lakes Lodge on Gullrock for a week of outstanding fishing. (Unless we get lucky enough to let our wives stretch it into another 2 week'er as we did last year)Trip #3 will be a week long trip with the family to The Lake of the Woods by Morson at a private cabin for some great family time, tubing, miles of sightseeing and exploring, and actually squeeze in some fishing.

5855626,That Minnesota guy,2017-11-12 10:59:00,8293,Curious about your Wolf trip in January. Won't the snow be kinda deep? Do they allow you to hunt from a motorized vehicle like a snowmobile? It's not one of those hunts where you shoot from a airplane is it? I really don't know much about how you would hunt Wolves in the winter.
5855706,johnboat,2017-11-12 12:42:00,2014,"Yes on the snow. Already a pretty good blanket down.No on the motorized vehicles. Double no on shooting, hanging out of an open door on a moving airplane.Hopefully just a peaceful sit in the crisp clean air deep in the Canadian bush enjoying the sights and sounds, taking in the smell of Cedar while doing some reflecting on years past and doing a little soul searching, and possibly finding ""Mr Other me"".................all the while waiting for a perfectly placed 200 yard shot with a 30.06 on those baby moose killing machines."
5855738,That Minnesota guy,2017-11-12 12:48:00,8293,So you shoot from a blind or a stand? Is baiting allowed or do Wolves use the same trails all the time? I know we hear Wolves howling from time to time at night but do they travel at night or mostly during the day? Just trying to understand how you would know where to set up.

For '18 my buds have said they would like a one-day drive each way, so we'll check this new lake out for the Opener. Then in mid-June heading back up to Fushimi Cabins that another good friend booked for a week, and will fish for walleyes and large pike.

Some couples go on a cruise or to Hawaii - I was blessed to marry a woman who enjoys being on the water, and fishing up north so we went north 40 years ago (ha). A few other quick day trips to Lake Erie for next Spring's ""jig bite""....and perhaps a trip up to the Detroit River (will see) for the Spring run.

Depending on my house being sold, as I will be retired as of next Friday, could end up being at Pine Sunset Lodge all summer. Wintering on Lake Griffin Fruitland Park, Florida."

My seasonal camper is only 1/2 hour from Canada so a quick trip in works at times. I don't think I'll be doing any fly-ins. I paid to much for the boat and I figure I might as well tow that and fish in comfort rather then a fly-in camp boat. I hope lots of guys here make it to Canada this year. I enjoy reading the reports and the planning stages of the trips. [/QUOT Want to chase some big pike and the occasional musky try Essox and the Manitou. Access to Essox landing is about 1 1/2 from Fort Francis. Late May and early June is the prime time. Excellent smallmouth fishing too. I've also caught lake trout casting spoons and spin baits over the reefs and the rip rap off the islands and shoreline points."

5855274,Baseline,2017-11-11 22:52:00,3207,"[QUOTE=That Minnesota guy;5855002] That is correct. Hwy 11 east to 502 north. 45 miles to Cedar Narrows Road. West on Cedar Narrows Road to Essox Landing about 20 miles -gravel, but graded and in good shape. Ramp is steep, but in good condition and there is ample parking. Canadian Rainy has good walleye, pike and crappie fishing in early June."
