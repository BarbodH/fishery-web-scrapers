5930914,Pooch,2018-01-05 08:15:00,4618,"^^^Exactly. If you have your own boat and fish with other boats it is very useful. Especially if one boat doesn't show up at when or where it is supposed to.We can get about the same range as the above post. Sometimes less many times more. Especially on LS or other big open water lakes.When I'm fishing LS alone and it gets rough or weather turns against me with no one on the other end of the line, it can be slightly intimidating.Pooch"
5931010,MrSimon,2018-01-05 09:08:00,922,"We use fairly high quality walkie talkies ... and they work well enough within a mile or so. Our general rule is you check in with the other boat before leaving an ""area""."
5931346,The tank,2018-01-05 11:47:00,340,last thing I want while im fishing is someone talking to me on a radio. we tried the high priced ones from cabelas they worked good for the other 2 boats but mine after the first day was in the off mode.
5933266,BornToFish,2018-01-06 18:42:00,1224,"Greetings,My limited experience with communicating while on lakes in Ontario is pretty much what has already been shared. We now pick a meeting time/place where boats can gather to share information (e.g. what patterns are or are not working). A boat that doesn't show up for the meeting is one that we watch for to make sure they are not in trouble.I have limited experience with satellite phones. My friend used one a few years back. It wasn't worth the bother due to dropped calls and the phone only working in select spots around the camp. The cost of the telephone and service wasn't a good value for him.One thing to remember is that others might very well be listening to your conversation over radio channels. You might want to exercise caution when chatting over the radio.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5933346,Aspencreek,2018-01-06 20:29:00,2911,"Born is right, I had a really hot bite going on and got on the horn to another boat in our party, before I knew it I had 2 different boats crowding in.....you would have thought I had thrown out a marker bouy or something."
5933578,BornToFish,2018-01-07 06:27:00,1224,"Greetings,Aspencreek picked up on one of my cautions. You might have unwanted fishing companions sharing your spot. I have a suspicion that MNR officers might listen to their radios as well.There is one other story behind my caution. My wife and I fished with very good friends Jim and Mary several years ago. Jim was an early morning guy, and enjoyed fishing at sunrise. Mary's day might begin slowly around 9:30 a.m. on a good day. Hence, Jim often fished by himself in the morning and come in for breakfast around mid-morning, such that they would go out together on the lake by late morning. This routine worked very well for them.Mary woke up unusually early one morning and was ready to go out fishing a few hours earlier than normal. She called Jim on the radio and reported that she was ready for him. It turned out that many of the anglers in camp were on he same radio channel that morning. There were many snickers at the dock for the remainder of the day. Jim and Mary were puzzled as to why people were asking them about how their breakfast went that morning.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5933802,Pooch,2018-01-07 10:13:00,4618,"We have learned to talk ""code"" or generic terms when talking between boats. There are always lurkers with their ears on the marine band. Just as bad as throwing a marker. Mention a specific spot and (I don't know where they come from) boats will show up. Bet on it every time.There are more people who do not know how to find fish out there than there are those that can find fish.Pooch"
5960650,Rock Hound,2018-01-22 10:06:00,51,"Marine Band radios are a great way to communicate on the water, and they also have an emergency contact if you have an issue on the water and don't have a companion boat on the lake with you. You can either have one installed on your boat or a hand held. The hand held radios don't have as much power / distance, but still have much better range than most radios."
5962530,Mike Borger,2018-01-23 10:36:00,1554,"It's possible to sync two inReach satellite communication devices so two boats can communicate with each other. We've done this a number of times on remote fly in's and it sure comes in handy.Most users myself included, use their phone via bluetooth connection to pair it with the inReach device. There is a free app you need to download first, but it works great. Allows you to send and receive emails or texts through your phone rather than the inReach device itself which can be a pain.Best part about the app, it allows you to download a detailed topo map of the area you're traveling to. When someone sends you a message (and vice versa) if the recipient pulls the map up it shows your location as a glowing red dot on the map.Obviously if you have two of those units synced, the safety aspect alone is worth a lot..."
5927338,Aspencreek,2018-01-03 15:15:00,2911,"Our group has tried to get the walkie talkies to work, have gone thru 3 different sets (all having bigger and better claims) and really work ""sometimes""....so without getting in to deep or spending even more we have decided that the tried and true, meeting place for lunch and place for heading in."
5928418,dschiebel,2018-01-04 01:12:00,85,"Me and my fishing partner just yell from the back of the boat to the front of the boat, works in all weather and does not need any power"

5928618,Bstar,2018-01-04 06:44:00,564,Lmao! We used some Motorola radios on our last trip and they work well for approx a mile. We tend to fish in the same general area so we don't need anything for long distances. About the only thing that might work for long distances on a remote lake would be a Delorme Inreach. You could use it to text between boats. Not a cheap option but it would work. Cabela's has them them for $249 plus the monthly subscription. I like dschiebel's option! I'm still laughing!
5928666,Aspencreek,2018-01-04 07:09:00,2911,"Yup, done that, but my brother just got his hearing aid, so the shouting may be lessened a bit, now if I can just get him to stop nodding off."
5928714,Lake Wisconsin,2018-01-04 07:29:00,1960,"VHF with an 8' antenna is your best low cost option. And everything in, you will be over $150/boat. You can find them used on Clist and such to lower your cost. On a wide open lake, your range will be in the 7-10 mile distance. And bluffs, rocks and trees, expect that to be cut by 1/2 to 1/3. I have not found walkie talkies to work worth a darn."
5929026,big popi,2018-01-04 08:59:00,635,"My son and I run VHF base units & 8' antennas. the rest of our group have a mixed bag of handheld (I got a handheld for Christmas) and base units with 3' whips. With the 8' the boy & I can usually hear the rest of group if they are more than mile to a mile & half away. With the two boats with the 8' whips - we can get 3-4 miles. To point out, there is a fair amount of iron ore deposits where we go, which I believe affects the range."
5929354,Bearing Man,2018-01-04 11:20:00,30,"In all of the years that I've done fly-ins, never had much luck with walkie-talkies or radios. We usually try to keep each other in sight on big lakes and it is a general rule/request of mine. On small lakes where it's easy to find other members of your group it's not as much of an issue. It does require cooperation and everybody has to be willing to fish a similar area. But as we get older, I really like having the other boats within the same basic area."
5929562,still fishin',2018-01-04 13:42:00,69,"6-7 boats in our group. Most of us have marine vhf radios. Just replaced mine last year. Basic model Uniden for $119. Replaced 3 ft antenna with 5 foot and the difference was immediately noticeable. Have no doubt that 8 footer would be even better. Installation very easy- took about 1 hour. Lake system we fish has many bays and islands. Previously I could reach other vhf equipped boats about 1 mile away. Can now reach 2-3 miles. The boats that don't have radios just motor up to a boat that does to check in periodically (we all stay within 1-2 miles, generally). We've tried the talkies and vhf handhelds without success. The ability to communicate has saved us time and helped put more fish in the boat. In years past we all had small boats without vhf's. We caught fish (even without electronics) but we definitely became more efficient with marine radios and electronics. That said, I would have just as much fun in a 14 foot boat with a 15 hp motor and no radio or electronics. FWIW. Good luck."
5929594,big popi,2018-01-04 13:56:00,635,"Troutwater, if you are looking at a VHF unit then look at what the IPX rating is. My experience with this is my dad, brother & I all bought was sold as a waterproof unit by Uniden. after owning these for less than a year, they all failed - they were IPX6 rated. IPX6 is waterproof for spray & not submersible rated. We tried to Uniden to stand behind the units, but they would not respond to us. I have bought a Cobra for my son and on my old Tyee. We had good luck with these units. On my new boat I went with a Standard Horizon. I did have a failure on the main screen, which SH fixed for $65 as it was out of the 3 year warranty."
5926186,troutwater,2018-01-03 07:16:00,299,"Greetings, I was curious as to how people keep in touch on the water with others in their group. I'm assuming walky talkies, but not sure what kind would be the best. Usually we're pretty remote with lots of islands, so cell phones don't cut it. We tried it one year and was nice being able to communicate patterns we saw during the day, but the talkies were kind of junk and didn't last. Thanks!"
5926338,maddogg,2018-01-03 08:25:00,178,We find the the Motoroa two way radios work very well.
5926346,last chance,2018-01-03 08:40:00,3262,there's just not any type of radio that's going to give you much range unless your line of sight is clear. I've tried several type radios that bragged about their range for deer hunting. but anything out of sight and they was useless. you might want to check into renting some satellite phones for your trip. I'm not sure if you can rent them for short term or not. but the weekly rent on then is not that much. and i don't know if the service comes with the rental. sat phones only need to have a view of the sky to get service anywhere. good luck on finding something that will work for you.
5926586,papadave,2018-01-03 09:57:00,151,I've tried several things and have the same answer as last chance but I'm really interested in the possibility of renting sat phones.
5926594,U D,2018-01-03 09:58:00,249,We have had the best luck with Marine band VHF handhelds.
5926602,papadave,2018-01-03 10:02:00,151,U D are you getting any distance? Unless we were in the open water MB VHF seemed to get a best of 5 miles but that might have been the quality or length of our antennas.
5926634,last chance,2018-01-03 10:13:00,3262,even the vhf handhelds doesn't give you much range and they are line of sight. if your using them on open water the handhelds are limited in range. if i was on open water i would rig something up to use a mounted vhf for 150.00 or less then get a good 8' antenna like the shakespear 5225 xt for around 110.00 on ebay and be done with it. a cheaper antenna will work but the antenna is the most important part of the system.
5926650,bthomas3333,2018-01-03 10:21:00,465,Same results here. We started with cheap (under $50) **** things only worked in yelling range. Went to mid price (50-100) slightly better. If you could see the other boat they work but only for around a mile or so. Then we went to the higher priced and still couldn't use it from one end of the lake to the other. Lake is about 7 miles long. Huge waste of money. I'm sure there is something out there that works but I am done wasting money.I have rented a lot of SAT phones. Prices have come down...They work but are still fairly pricey when you factor in the minutes packages. Boat to boat is an interesting idea. I guess then you would need two phones / two minutes packages. Every call would burn minutes on both sides. They would also need to be left in the stand by mode to receive the call thereby burning the batteries. I would guess this solutions would be around $400 all in for the week.Brett
5926730,bigdaddyguns,2018-01-03 10:47:00,608,"As mentioned already, there is no highly reliable solution for this type of communication scenario. These communication distances are limited by the physics of the transmit and receive antenna heights. Handheld radios you can expect 2-5 miles with clear line of site. Add in obstructions like trees, land, rocks, etc. in the path and signal loss via shadowing will reduce the achievable distances even more. 8' marine antennas on a boat will provide longer line of site distances however the shadowing loss effects of in-path obstructions will still be an issue as 8' above water does not get the signal above the clutter and obstructions heights."
