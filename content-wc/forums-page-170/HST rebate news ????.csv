I have a Church that brings up 40+ people, and they use the rebate to bring up under privileged kids on their next trip. It's a big deal to do away with this and to jump minimum wage at the exact same time. That's a lot of stress that the Government has put on small business owners all at one time."

5978354,Ricky Spanish,2018-02-01 12:35:00,1298,It must have been blood left behind by all the Chicago area folks that have been fishing in NW Ontario since forever. I would bet the lodge I go to sees 80% of it's business from there.
5978498,phishfearme,2018-02-01 13:47:00,1242,"Obabikon - I hope you provided this input to NOTO - note that they stated: ""For those of you (NOTO members) who have guests that have applied for this rebate in the past, it is critical that you keep our office informed of their reactions (good or bad)."" it is also interesting to note that NOTO and other lobby groups are ""Currently planning to propose a different initiative that will have more benefits to tourism which may very well see us all asking that GST not be applicable to tourism packages at all."" they apparently feel that tourists - who do not use (significantly) the HST tax - should not pay it. a valid effort but it's easy to tax people who cannot vote you out of office so I do not hold much hope here. phish"
5978594,Obabikon,2018-02-01 14:20:00,2370,"I absolutely have provided my feedback. My faith in NOTO being able to get something changed is slim.

5879426,Obabikon,2017-11-30 21:21:00,2370,"This rebate (which was helpful for our guests) was a bad idea from the Government stand point.First off... every rebate eventually is done away with. They replace it or repeal it or tax it or what ever Governments do. If they had never initialized it in the first place, there would be no backlash when they got rid of it.Secondly... I honestly can't think of another program that actually gives tax dollars back to tourists. The entire point of tourism is to stimulate the economy (ie... take other country's wealth and make it your wealth). Maybe Canada believed that the tourism industry wasn't a huge deal... or maybe they hoped it would stimulate the economy. Who knows.Last point... it was great while it lasted!"

Likely the road to Pickle Lake wasn't constructed and maintained by local residents paying their share of HST, or property and income taxes either. Tax dollars from higher population centers in the south have subsidized our roads and most of our services. So the extra $100 per person you will contribute in the future will go towards making your NW Ontario experience a good one now and in the future. That's a **** of a wise investment in my mind!

I'm also not sure where the funding for these roads came from - I'm sure the mining companies paid some of it but no doubt lots came from taxes - probably gas taxes more than other tax forms. I still say that we visitors pay more than ""our fair share"" (what we use) to the governments via the services we purchase. taxing transients is very easy to accomplish - they cannot vote you out of office.

5881042,Bill Krejca,2017-12-02 07:59:00,6107,"My observation over the years has been that the only reason a road is built is to accommodate some type of industry, whether it be mining, forestry, hydro power, or oil.

5881906,Pooch,2017-12-03 06:09:00,4618,"Don't you think that is pretty much true anywhere in the world? A good example is the Cabo San Lucas area. There is little reason for it to exist but for tourism so fairly good roads appeared along with airports. In that area tourism is huge and a driving force. I doubt there is enough tourism dollars north of the trans Canadian to support the good roads in that area. Timber and mining most likely were the reason originally.I've got one guy in our group that remembers the Red Lake road being gravel until the gold mines in Red Lake really started to produce.While the tourist industry in Canada is a plus, I doubt it is enough to support good roads. Especially when many of us buy so little fuel north of the border. (and that is just human nature)Canada fishing is still a bargain for those of us who do not need to be entertained with flash and glitter, but just seek some peace and quiet.Pooch"
5882258,Bill Krejca,2017-12-03 12:33:00,6107,"Re: Reason anywhere - Yeah, I think that is true. It can be very expensive building roads, and I imagine (don't know, but imagine) that the govt steps in, in one form or another to defray some of the construction costs. In Canada, I doubt that many roads were created just to attract tourists. Those of us going to spots near roads' ends are usually traveling where there may have been relatively heavy traffic at one time, traffic which continues, or probably more the case, ceases, the industry which once flourished having just wore out in some manner.

Kind of like a fly in without the plane ride.Doesn't effect our drive to trips with our own boats.Just another passing thought. Everyone likes a ""rebate"". (even Menards)Pooch"

There was a post on this thread that reportedly contained a quote from a Canada government official. This quote basically stated that the Canada government recognized that the rebate program was costing the government too much to administer, therefore the Canada government was just going to keep the money. This quote went on to further state that the Canada government would in turn use a portion of this ""new"" money to pay for a government sponsored advertising campaign in support of the tourism industry. This statement sort of reminded me of the old saying about the US government: We are from Washington and are here to help"". I suspect some anglers won't be very pleased when they learn next season that they are no longer entitled to a HST rebate. I know of several people that vacation in Canada that use their rebate money as part of their down payment for next year's trip. Kindest regards...."

I don't ever remember getting many dollars back though every little bit helps, but it was not a large amount.The two camps where we bring in our own boats I get nothing back. We do get some refund back from a third camp where they transport us into camp and we use their boats. So it appears to not affect everyone the same. I've never quite figured out which services I'm not receiving that I get a tax rebate on.The whole thing is over my pay grade and won't change us going or not with or without the HST refund.Most guys (including myself sometimes) fill up south of the border and seldom buy fuel in Canada, but we drive on their highways.

Many times the amount causes me to scratch my head -- it's never been what I calculated -- but I've always gotten it. I make the trip in the spring and fall. In the spring I cash the previous fall's check at a Fort Frances bank. No bank charge or adjustment and it gives me plenty of Canadian cash for the trip. In the fall the spring check gets cashed. We get a single receipt at the lodge for 3 guys and make a single rebate request. I've got a little over $130.00 coming back on the one that is in process. $130.00 covers a lot of incidental expenses including the $1.15 postage and the 5 minutes of time it takes to apply."

We'll stop in International Falls on our way up in the spring and cash it. Our rebate check pretty much covers any incidental expenses we incur in Canada without the need to be concerned about exchange rates or fees from my US bank. I'm going to miss this program.
5706290,Guest,2017-08-07 17:17:00,0,I sent mine in June 12 and got the check on August 4. Of course your bank charges you to deposit international check and then discounts it.
5736345,fsz,2017-08-24 13:29:00,144,"Probably not, but.....I'm not aware of any state that has a 13% sales tax. For example, Florida (a snow-bird destination for many americans and canadians) the state sales tax is 6% plus most counites tack on 1% for a total of 7%. Arizona, another snow-bird state, is around the same percentage with the local add-ons. That said, the price is the price and the tax is the tax, you gotta pay to play. Whether you go to ontario or florida. Ending the program might not have an effect now on bookings, but there is presently a favourable exchange rate for US visitors. If the exchange rate goes back to ""even money"", or the US has another recession like 2008-2010, well thats another story. One person paying for himself the tax is a small issue. Book a trip for a family of 4 at $4-6 K and the tax is a little painful."

5737105,Guest,2017-08-25 01:37:00,0,"Actually, the province charges an 8% PST Provincial Sales Tax. Then there is a 5% Federal Sales Tax GST which goes to Ottawa. Ontario overall has an HST Harmonized Sales tax to combine the 2 taxes. 5+8=13% So it's on really an 13% provincial sales tax All that aside, as a Canadian lodge operator, I thick it sucks that the Feds are taking away the rebate. I guess us Canadian need to find a way to pay for Prime minister Truedeu 2 Nannys somehow, and pay for all then refugees pouring into the country. Meanwhile our Medical system is in a shambles. Look! No you got me started. Ok Ok! Chill time with the sweet nectar of a splash of crown Royal!"

This then stopped, and 1/2 of the new tax could be refunded, providing specific, narrowly defined guidelines, along with a possible few eye-winks were applied. It was/is interesting that the checks, when made available, are very difficult (as least it has been my experience) to cash in the U.S., as, of course, they are made out in Canadian dollars. Canadian banks, of course, will cash the checks, as long as the check holder can get into one - most Canadian banks are only open weekdays, when most U.S. visitors are not there. I managed to cash 2 years worth this year, at the grace of my friendly resort owner, whose services didn't meet the guidelines for refunds(I had stayed at a different resort, whose services did met the guidelines, refunds were from there).
