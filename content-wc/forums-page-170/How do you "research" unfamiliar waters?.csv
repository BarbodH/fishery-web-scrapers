Toporama is a good source for making your own topographical maps and if you can't find a depth map for free there are many available at fishingmapsplus. Some lakes do appear on map chips for your electronics which is of course, awesome. Last winter I spent several hours looking at satellite pictures of areas I planned to explore in the summer. I identified a couple dozen humps, long points, probable boulder fields and stream inlets. Some of them actually produced! They gave me many hours of enjoyment in February and a plan that made my exploring time feel more productive and focused. The best spot I found was a rock pile that was invisible in the pictures but not far from a long point I had identified. I might have found it just by chance, I like to think that by doing my research and focusing on that area I found it quicker. I also got some invaluable tips from posters here that helped me shorten up the learning curve on that particular lake. Both general areas to fish and useful patterns for my time of year. Many nice folks here who can help you out."
5971610,pjshorthorn,2018-01-29 06:00:00,5654,"I've made two solo trips to Lac Seul. They were wonderful experiences with amazing fall foliage at the end of September. As you mentioned, I explored other areas I hadn't fished in the past and found some new places that held some really nice fish. Saw the largest bull moose I have ever seen one morning and a bald eagle sat right above me perched in a tree for a couple of hours while I was jigging for walleye. Pretty cool sights. I will say though, it is a little weird when the only spoken words in the boat are to the animals that you see. PjShorthorn"
5973386,valley366,2018-01-29 19:56:00,193,"I would also like to plug the Navionics app on a phone or a tablet. I actually bought a reasonably inexpensive Samsung tablet with Android OS just for this purpose. Is a 8 inch screen, bought a semi waterproof otter box and installed the App. Have it sitting on the rod locker anytime in the boat.For at home research I spend a lot of time on the Navionics Web App. Can see all the maps that are available and I get a general idea of the lake system looking at that. https://webapp.navionics.com/#boatin..._%7B%7BqGbzqyPYou can't make waypoints in the web app but you can see all the structure. Key for Canada on that site is to click the sonar symbol in the bottom left of the screen to switch between Navionics maps and SonarChart. Have found that depending on the lake and the source of data one may be better than the other."
5973978,MrSimon,2018-01-30 08:24:00,922,"Maps, apps, and research are great, important, and fun!! But nothing is as important as being able to adjust once you get there. Reading and adjusting to the weather, wind, and water temp is more important than having a detailed contour map. Another way to research and prepare is to practice ""canada techniques"" on your local waters. It sounds silly, but being good with bottom bouncers, back trolling, jigging, and casting spoons is important. And those techniques aren't commonly used in many parts of the US. I spent a lot of time dialing in my bottom bouncer technique on my local lake before a recent trip to Canada. I was surprised at how many little details I ended up tweaking ... like bouncer weight, leader length, main line (switched to braid to feel bottom better), and boat speed. I even caught some cool stuff during ""practice""."
5974906,billy weaver,2018-01-30 15:57:00,470,"I tried this and I like it, I printed off some topo maps of the lake I fish and marked up some by hand and look at them and plan my next trip. Thank you for the info. Billy"
5969618,andreindy,2018-01-27 18:23:00,308,"On LS. I circled it. Not sure if you are familiar with the phrase/book ""Where's Waldo"", but it's akin to finding two boats on a 150 mile long body of water."
5969650,BornToFish,2018-01-27 18:47:00,1224,"Greetings,Several of the previous posts offered great suggestions as to sources of information pertaining to gain an understanding of the lake that you will be fishing.I will offer two other suggestions. First, I encourage you to have a good understanding of the movements of your target fish species before you start searching for places to fish. Others on Walleye Central might help you in this regard. The key is that fish are almost always in certain types of water at certain times of the season. This might help focus your search for places to fish. There may be no need to search for spring spots if the fish are on deep water points or rock humps.My second suggestion is to be diligent in your search before you leave for trip. Then, be open to new sources of information once you arrive at your lodge. I encourage you to talk to the lodge owner to find out what's been going on the past week or so on the lake. You might want to hire a guide for the first day or two of your trip. Probably the most important thing to do is make friends at the dock. Veteran guests are often (but not always) willing to help first-timers on the lake.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5969778,pjshorthorn,2018-01-27 22:06:00,5654,"This is an educated guess on the area of Lac Seul you circled. In the lower right hand corner, that would be Devil's Elbow (triangular shape land structure/ point and The Rags just to the NE. From Devil's Elbow to the left in the picture, the waterway heads north through Grassy Bay/Grassy Lake , Canoe Bay and eventually leads to the area circled which I believe to be Whitepine Point. Just to the west of Whitepine Point is Eagle Island. Due south of Whitepine Point would by Vaughn Bay and Vaughn Lake. Lac Seul is a Canadian treasure. Every serious fisherman should try it at least once or a hundred times in their lifetime. PjShorthorn"
5969850,Pooch,2018-01-28 04:05:00,4618,"Ding, Ding... You are the winner PJS. That is Eagle NW of the traveling boats. The boats are traveling west on the north shore of Kejick Bay Island.You seem to be familiar with that area. I think I've mentioned to you that we fish out of Mahkwa each early fall or late summer.Pooch"
5970050,pjshorthorn,2018-01-28 07:36:00,5654,"I have never fished that particular stretch of Lac Seul. The thing that stuck out in the picture to me was Devil's Elbow.......I've made the turn around that point and also through the Rags 35+ times. Using the Elbow as a landmark it was pretty easy to figure out the area circled in the picture. Yes, I think you mention that you fish out of Mahkwa about every chance you get..........just teasing. Couple of questions. Where is Mahkwa located on the lake in relation to Vaughn Bay, Eagle Island,etc.? Once you pass Hudson, how long does it take to drive to Mahkwa? I know fishing is really good in that section of the lake. I have just spent all my time fishing the upper end of the NE section for many years. By now , I could probably pilot my way in a houseboat from Hudson all the way up to Merritt Point without a map, but I am getting old and a little feeble minded to try it without a map...... PjShorthorn"
5970106,pjshorthorn,2018-01-28 07:51:00,5654,"Andre,If you decide to look at fishing the NE section of Lac Seul, let me know and I'll be glad to help in any way I can. I have sent info. to a number of folks on this forum based on my fishing experiences in that area. I have copied and pasted many many emails together into one thread to keep a running synopsis of all the discussions.To your original question, I do a lot of research using Google Earth, but the vast majority is by using a good old paper map. Depending on the lake you ar looking at, you will have multiple outlets to find good maps. If you are going to fish a very popular lake like LOTW or Eagle Lake, you can find really nice maps from Fishing Hot Spots that are very detailed with fishing spots,hazards and tatics to use. I have also bought some decent maps from canadamapsales.com along with looking at the many many lakes detailed on the Ministry's website. If you are doing a remote flyin trip, the outfitter should be able to provide you with more than enough info. to use for planning purposes.Have fun dreaming about the next greatest place to visit.PjShorthorn"
5970370,Pooch,2018-01-28 09:12:00,4618,"I use Mahkwa as a reference point for those that know the area so I do mention it nearly every time. I thought you fished that same area for some reason? From Hudson to Mahkwa is a short hour on reasonably good road, but for the last mile or so. For those who don't know it is located on the Reserve and run by those folks. There are a couple other offerings in the immediate area for cabin rentals, but they are pretty low key.What are you calling ""Devil's Elbow""? And where are ""The Rags"" in the picture? I've tried to find them on maps, but can't. I've not fished any further east or NE than Pine Point area. Do the houseboats get close to that area of the map?Pooch"
5970554,pjshorthorn,2018-01-28 10:38:00,5654,"Mahkwa is right in the the area Andre circled. I felt like it was based on the road and clearings in the area, but wasn't sure. Not bad in terms of time from Hudson. On the picture, Devil's Elbow would be in the lower right hand corner where two stretches of water come together right around Metco Island to form a triangular shape of islands where the waterways intersect. The Rags are on the NE side of the islands ......you can see a smaller channel that will cut through and lead into what I call Three Island Stretch ( Southwind Island area ) going north towards Banana Island and Taylor Island. In theory, houseboats could absolutely take a nav route up through Grassy Bay/ Grassy Lake and Canoe Bay. At the north end of Popular Island the nav route heads due north to Pine Point or one could hook a left and head west all the way to Ear Falls. In my experience, most HB groups head NE towards Taylor Island and then find their home for the week . If you haven't seen any HBs fishing Pine Point, my gut says is that most are heading more NE through Bear Narrows up the Chamberlain Narrows and beyond. Great way to travel and camp, but it is a slow ride at 10 about mph depending on how many boats one is dragging behind the HB. PjShorthorn"
5970754,Pooch,2018-01-28 13:18:00,4618,"I marked the Mahkwa camp location on the photo in my last post. Have never seen a houseboat anywhere we fish, but we seldom go past Pine Point area to the east of the camp. From west to east we fish about a twenty to thirty mile stretch of water and will not live long enough to see all in that area. Just a whole bunch of water there alone to explore. On rare occasion we see a guide boat from SWW on the far west end of our ""comfort"" range.I'd like to make a trip alone to that area and do nothing but hunt spots. When you are there with a boat partner they want to stay on fish, even if it means fishing the same locations. I love to stretch my legs and see what I might be missing. Life is too short to fish the same scenery all the time. I want uneducated fish that have had a chance to grow into the walleye equivalent of NFL linemen.Pooch"
5971274,andreindy,2018-01-28 18:16:00,308,"PJS, I entirely appreciate the camaraderie you offer and that Walleye Central provides. Lac Seul is on the bucket list, someday I hope. It is a body of water I hope to graduate up to, when all of my skills have grown. Our 2nd ever trip to Canada is this mid-July to Abamasagi...a fly-in with Twin Lakes Air in the Nakina area (father, nephew, brother-in-law, brother)."
5968522,andreindy,2018-01-26 21:17:00,308,"I am interested in knowing what process others use to ""research"" unfamiliar bodies of water? For example, I have found Google Earth to be a pretty interesting tool...helping me see islands, inlets, and even underwater structure at times...plus it's just fun. Another way of phrasing my question: How do you prepare for a new body of water? What resources do you use? The context for my question is that I am taking the men in my family to Abamasagi in July. Never been there. Second time to Canada. And I have an agonizingly long 6-7 months until that wonderful trip arrives. Researching and planning not only helps me survive the time, but also helps me avoid a complete case of ""strategy block"" when we arrive. My next question might be: How to prevent your wife from divorcing you because you talk about Canada too much."
5968746,Babamel2,2018-01-27 06:05:00,414,"to prevent divorce, I took my wife to Canada the second summer we were married. Since then, she has had more interest and excitement than I have. PS. this is not our first marriage, In the twelve years we have been married, she has spent 17 weeks fishing in Canada. three different lakes. Its been a great time"
5968834,cozz3,2018-01-27 07:12:00,5,"Early in marriage I sprinkled some Canadian water in my wife’s drink and later in the kids bottle and they have been under walleye spell ever since. Here is the research program I run:1. Fishonline and GIS – its features (natural current, some depth charts) and aerial zoom is the best I found. a. https://www.gisapplication.lrc.gov.o...e&locale=en-US. b. http://www.gisapplication.lrc.gov.on...T&locale=en-USc. http://www.gisapplication.lrc.gov.on...M&locale=en-US2. I find out who is local wildlife office and give him a call. If there are depth charts, they will have them. 3. With combination of sites above and google earth I create waypoints on a map. I make a map that I can print and put in the boat4. Also convert the waypoints to Lowrance format via GPS babel and load on my unit. 5. Due to a lack of map coverage on my depth finder, after about 2 months of trial and error I created an aerial map of all the lakes in Ontario that runs on my lowrance via the .AT5 mapping format. It’s not as nice as navionics but at least it shows where I am on the water and matches the aerial photos with the waypoints I created ."
5968898,Pooch,2018-01-27 07:58:00,4618,"Ask for info on whatever lake in Canada here on WC and you will always get some answers from folks who have been there.Like the above guys said, ""Get maps, good maps"" and study them. Many remote lakes have no maps available, but once you've grown accustomed to fishing either a rocky 'Shield"" lake or a reservoir lake (like Lac Suel) then most lake fish about the same.Even having a map of a particular lake does not give much accurate information other than island locations. Depth and hazard maps are notoriously inaccurate. Regardless of how much and pretty they are. Most are just copied old lake maps from the Ministry. Much better than nothing though.Most camp owners have some sort of map available. Ask and if possible get one in advance then start updating it from other sources before heading there.I like Google Earth for getting to understand the layout of a lake while setting at home dreaming about it. Resolution in rural Canada isn't nearly as good as near population centers. Again, WC is a fantastic resource for information on a destination.Pooch"
