There isn't a better way to keep fish fresh for filleting.How many fools do you see every year drag dead fish around on a stringer in the summer when surface temps are warm then at the fish house clean a rigor-mortise walleye that is nearly white as it's faded and starting to deteriorate. No thank you...Listen to what Prov1800 says about the English river system regs..Pooch"
5968066,Bakefish,2018-01-26 13:11:00,1077,"Which zone, the English River goes for quite a ways. Thanks."
5949514,prov1800,2018-01-15 20:43:00,5010,Best and fasted way to kill is to break there necks.no fooling around o sore knuckles.lol.
5949770,martinbns,2018-01-16 05:56:00,1520,"That's what I was going to say. Up to about 4 pounds it's easy, and the meat is very white."
5949842,prov1800,2018-01-16 06:32:00,5010,When water temps get real warm I will bring ice in a cooler no matter what lake iam on.i find the meat stays real firm rather than lightly mussy.you could cut the throat area to bleed them out also.also was told by a game warden that if your going to trailer home or back to a camp your at the live well must be drained.so just makes sense to use a cooler and ice and makes counting much easier if your keeping fish.
5949866,Obabikon,2018-01-16 06:53:00,2370,"I would MUCH rather fillet fish from an ice chest, than a live well. Dead or alive... the cold fish are easier, and to me the seem cleaner."
5949882,prov1800,2018-01-16 07:02:00,5010,Tottaly agree.dont have to chase them around in the live well and no cuts on your hands.lol.win win situation.
5949946,Ricky Spanish,2018-01-16 07:40:00,1298,"In case anyone doesn't know, get a firm grip behind the gills with one hand and push ""up"" under the chin until you hear a crack. It takes surprisingly little effort to snap the spine. I wish I learned it a long time ago. Always felt a little bad when they're still flopping at fillet-time."

5952250,MikeAnkeny,2018-01-17 11:44:00,67,So where in the rules does it talk bout killing keepers?
5952338,stjoeguy,2018-01-17 12:39:00,979,"2018 Fishing Ontario Recreational Fishing Regulations Summary, page 20, Zone 4 Exceptions, Lac Seul: No person may possess any live fish taken by angling other than baitfish.http://files.ontario.ca/environment-...-4-english.pdf"
5966890,123chadder,2018-01-25 18:56:00,429,might as well kill them then....
5945674,dschiebel,2018-01-14 02:11:00,85,"We do a flyin about 40 miles east of Red Lake Ontario on a lake called Mink Lake. I have never heard exactly if we are allowed to have fish on a stringer. We always have, but I have heard rumors that the fish must be killed immediately if you are going to keep them. Anybody know for sure ."
5945818,Obabikon,2018-01-14 06:25:00,2370,"That is a special rule that certain lakes use. Off the top of my head Lac Seul is the only one I can think of. You should be just fine with your fly-in. That said, once they are on the stringer, they are not supposed to ever be released."
5945834,Bstar,2018-01-14 06:30:00,564,Check the regulations. I didn't see anything in the exceptions in zone 4 specific to Mink Lake. I know on Lac Seul you must kill immediately. No fish in live wells or on stringers. Most other lakes stringers are allowed for transport to camp/shorelunch.
5946106,jdfire,2018-01-14 08:54:00,16,"Minnitaki has the same rule that all fish that are kept must be killed immediately. We received a warning from the conservation folks doing a creel survey one year. They explained that it was to prevent culling, which tends to release fish that don't tend to make it. Luckily we usually don't have a problem finding fish closer to lunch time, hate to have them floating in the ""dead"" well to long."
5946122,prov1800,2018-01-14 09:06:00,5010,This is a rule for English river waters only.
5948490,MikeAnkeny,2018-01-15 11:47:00,67,We were told at camp that we did not have to kill the fish we placed in an iced cooler.
5948498,MikeAnkeny,2018-01-15 11:47:00,67,On Lac Seul
5949138,prov1800,2018-01-15 16:34:00,5010,Not sure which camp your staying at on lac suel but the owner is totally wrong.all fish need to be killed right away if your going to keep them.8
5949378,Wall-i-Lama,2018-01-15 18:37:00,1524,"You are correct. I used to fish LOTW, and for the two fish or so we were keeping for dinner that night, we would cut the gills and place them in the livewell to bleed out. Much less mess when cleaning. Before my first trip to Lac Seul, I read about the requirement to kill the fish. So I sent an email to the MNR to see if I could just cut the gills and throw them in the live well. The response was very clear. The fish must be immediately be killed if it is being kept. They indicated that you would not pass the test if you cut the gills and the fish were partially alive and swimming in the livewell. Whether on ice, or bleeding out in the livewell, the fish must be dead. i wouldn't want to take the chance and just throw them on ice without killing them first. He didn't seem that leave any wobble room in his reply about the definition of ""immediate"" and ""dead""."
5949426,pjshorthorn,2018-01-15 19:20:00,5654,"On Lac Seul, I dispatch the fish with about three good whacks to the head right between the eyes......use a pair of pliers, a beaver stick, use something to kill them quickly. As mentioned, you don't want a fish partially alive on a stringer, one flopping around in a cooler or a walleye flipping their tail in the the livewell if the Ministry were to come visit. My guess you will get a ticket every time. Regardless of other lakes I fish in Canada, I have used the same practice. Just makes it easier without worry of regulation requirements. PjShorthorn"
