6675452,Pooch,2022-07-26 12:31:00,4618,I'm not sure that is always true. Paying what a camp is worth as far as the physical assets is a lot like farming. Most can't come up with those kind of dollars to get started. Buying a run down camp is an uphill fight. Buying a fire sale (priced under the actual value) camp might be the only way to get started. If a camp is profitable they are not usually for sale. I looked into buying a camp once and not buying it was one of the better decisions I have ever made. Interesting topic. Pooch
6675464,Ver88,2022-07-26 13:33:00,114,"What a dishonest thing to do. If this was reversed and people showed up at the the resort for vacation and the resort said they cancelled your reservation without notice, I think people would be very upset."
6675466,rzep,2022-07-26 13:44:00,1196,"Its all in the fine print. From what I recall, the few places I went to had a grace period for cancellations to get deposit back or rolled. Part of the business. This was 5 years ago or so .. not sure if they do now .. I agree that when times are good, no one is calling me and offering 50% discount .. I can do pinky swear on that one !"
6675470,Bigtaproot,2022-07-26 13:56:00,900,"I think buying a camp is the country person equivalent of a rich city person buying a vineyard. A good way to lose money. That being said, I am happy to give my money to those people that take a chance and make it work. I wonder if most camps are owned by Canadians or Americans?"
6675484,Cgillespie,2022-07-26 14:29:00,120,The one I go to is Canadian owned.
6675502,Old Timer,2022-07-26 15:44:00,255,"Da'Walleye made an interesting observation on his way to Red Lake no kids, just old people. I represented the outdoor tourism business for 35 years. Maybe 15-20 years ago a client hired a marketing research company to assess who was going on Canadian fishing trips. The results were interesting. The average age of guests was going up and camps were trading among themselves the same old people who routinely fished Canada. There wasn't much recruitment of younger paying guests. Then I've learned this from a number of camp owners. Grandfathers and fathers who annually took children and grandchildren on trips were passing away or becoming too old to go. When this happened the children and grandchildren had little interest in keeping the tradition alive and the trip became no more. On top of this Covid came along and people started using their vacation money for something else and their annual Canada trips became less important. And for many older would-be travelers the ArriveCAN app and the risk of a random test are daunting and not worth the trip. When one or two guys drops out the whole trip is jeopardized and goes by the wayside. So combining together the vaccine requirement, the border crossing protocol, two lost years and aging travelers created a perfect storm explaining why camps find their phones ringing less often. Then some folks are deciding at the last minute to bail on their reservations, including those who knew months ago they didn't have a full trip or would never qualify to enter Canada. Why folks in this bunch don't have the common decency to alert their camps early on is beyond me."
6675608,Baseline,2022-07-26 22:06:00,3207,"The Canadian Government, like the USA, does not view what they did to respond to Covid as a debacle.....They view it as what they needed to do to protect their citizens. Whether our opinions view the actions taken as right or wrong, I doubt any substantial future aid is coming toward the resort business. Same thing in the USA. My view of canceling a reservation to a seasonal and smaller sized business and not at least offering to pay up is a real show of being inconsiderate and CHEAP. VRBO, AirBB and just about any other resort type business in the US or beach location requires 50% down at the time of reservation and payment in full 60 to 30 days in advance with no refunds unless you purchase trip insurance. I would imagine that if cancellations become a real problem for these Canadian resorts we will see similar policies."
6675666,Bakefish,2022-07-27 09:18:00,1077,"I've observed the same thing for quite a few years now. The business model of Canadian resorts will have to change or their goose is going to be cooked. I was at a place this year that required you going down several steps to get to the docks. My cabin was located right at the top of the steps. I watched every single person over 60 gasping for air and leaning on the railing at the top of the steps, including myself. Even though the camp and camp owners were ok I won't be going back. Combine the uphill climb with 15 hours driving and the trip is becoming impossible for many that have been doing this for years. My group used to consist of 8 people. Every one of the older guys dropped out once they hit the 70 mark. Now it's down to me and my best friend and he can't drive, so I'm wondering how many years we've got left. We're 71 and 72. We treat each trip as if it's our last. I talked to a resort owner and he told me that if you can't retire after 20 years of owning a resort then you aren't doing it right. I don't think that holds true now You'll be seeing a lot of resorts for sale in the coming years simply because the clientele are getting too old to make the trip and there aren't enough younger guys to take their place."
6675694,Walleye2242,2022-07-27 11:05:00,263,All of this hits home and is exactly what I see. I am 50. Been going since i was 7. The group of 10-14 is now me and my buddy and thats it. People have passed on but also other memebers of the group just do not want to hassle with the border and covid did a number with that. I just do not see many younger groups up there fishing. It use to be really hard to get into a camp and you better have your crap together and get your money and reservations in....now...i can make a call to a few of the places I like to go and know i will get in.
6675698,Bigtaproot,2022-07-27 11:12:00,900,i understand your concern but i feel that fishing is such a pleasure in Canada that people will always do it
6675252,RichA$1970,2022-07-25 20:19:00,1159,"As the markets change, the customer now holds the advantage. Until the entry requirements are lifted and inflation has settled, I won’t book a resort in advance but schedule vacation with my crew (3 of them are retired) and start calling 1 week ahead to see what they have open. If they are booked, good for them and I’ll call my #2 choice and so on (last year I called my #1 choice which was new for us and they were only 50% booked). If you had a deposit down before Covid regulations and still not vaccinated, those customers should have noticed the camps way early to let them know they aren’t coming if the vaccination is still required. Inflation is another excuse as that $1,000 trip is more like $1,500 including surcharges and taxes that some probably just said they will lose the $200-$500 deposit."
6675262,KC Walleye,2022-07-25 20:30:00,274,"If most resorts start requiring 50-100% down with no refunds, you can bet that many people will adopt this practice and some resorts will certainly suffer in the end. Sad situations all around."
6675288,Da' Walleye Assassun,2022-07-25 21:40:00,358,"I just got back from Red Lake area on a fly-in. We saw no kids headed north, mostly old guys. Just my personal observation. Feel free to draw your own conclusions."
6675290,bbheli,2022-07-25 21:44:00,1387,"Who elected you to ball others out ? First off you may be hearing of cancelations but you have no clue why people cancelled. Sure I get it book a trip no vaccine and hope the law relaxes is only one reason. While your heart bleeds for Canada, Americans are suffering all time high gas prices, increased food costs, energy rate increase, jobs lost, stock market and investments decline higher interest rates and more. I saw a woman with three young children on the road side today begging for money to eat. i’m sure if it comes to feeding ones family vs going to Canada to fish feeding the family comes first. All business need to be capitalized and just as resorts had issues so did every American business. If they can’t survive someone else will open it up just as every other business that goes under. If they don’t pitch a tent.Running a business has risk, we don’t share in the profit or savings when they have a good year and we’re not responsible for a bad year, we’re not investors were partners. i see the intent in your post but it’s nonsense to lambast people. ."
6675370,C182P,2022-07-26 08:50:00,59,"Having two friends in the Canadian outpost / fly in business all I can go by is what they tell me their situation is. Prior to Covid running at or near 100% capacity Post COVID reservations are significantly down. Cancellations haven't been the issue. Phone isn't ringing. What's to blame? I can only speculate but the high costs of the ""exciting transition to green energy"" are tapping into everyone's spare fun money, and the vaccine mandate is definitely stopping others, as well as the threat of the random test hassle. The vaccine mandate is no different than when Canada began turning away those that had prior DUI arrests. You lose one or two in your normal fishing group because they won't get vaccinated and good chance the other 4 or 5 don't go on the trip either and it falls apart. Miss the trip one year (or two in the case of Canada being closed for most of 2 full summers) and people found alternate ways to spend their time and money. Much of the pain being felt by the Canadian tourist industry is the result of the governments actions on COVID the last few years. I have a couple of other friends that started going to Alaska the last 2 summers because Canada wasn't open. In the end for a little more money they experienced world class fishing in Alaska. Alaska meant no threats of vaccine mandates or border hassles, and they have no plans on returning to Canada. Not busting on anyone or saying Canada did anything wrong, just saying actions have consequences. We've had plenty of adverse consequences south of the border due to government policies on COVID."
6675382,walleyecheek,2022-07-26 09:31:00,2231,Kids can't and will absolutely not be without CELL service !...........LOL.
6675398,emma17,2022-07-26 10:15:00,436,Agree it's a little presumptuous to lay the cancellation blame entirely on people that booked and hoped the regs would change. I lost three from my group- only one was vaccine related. I also agree if you did book hoping the regs would change- be a responsible adult and notify the camp asap. I wonder if camp owners will (can) request proof of vaccinations from all making reservations?
6675408,Honkerslayer,2022-07-26 10:36:00,238,"I went in June and the camp I was in experienced the same thing. 9 cabins total and 4 were last minute cancellations. Like the day before. Im not going to speculate as to why, but after 35 years of going to the same camp I can tell you this isn’t even close to normal. If I were an owner of a camp I would figure out something to help offset this problem. It could indeed create higher and/or non-refundable deposits. I understand things can and do happen, but a good relationship with your outfitter certainly has its upside. Bailing last minute on a held reservation is not very considerate if there isn’t a good reason. Hoping regulations change is not a good reason in my books."
6675416,Walleye2242,2022-07-26 10:59:00,263,If this post is considered balling out people and being lambasted your 10 ply bud.
6675418,Bigtaproot,2022-07-26 11:02:00,900,"Although this seems a little harsh, it is hard to argue with the logic presented here. We are not investors but customers and dont expect anything other than to pay more when times are good for the outfitters. Running a camp is difficult but it is not like you need a medical degree to run one. My point being if the current operators go under, there will be people standing in line to give it a go"
6675166,kim n indiana,2022-07-25 12:58:00,62,"We all love to go on these fishing trips to canada. We plan, research, pour over internet looking for that one perfect place. I get it. I do it all winter long. But i'm hearing about way to many cancelations at last minute. Outfitters n Lodge owners just endured 2 yrs of covid, and now they are getting stuck with open dates at last minute and can't replace those bookings. Keeping the deposits at that late a date doesn't begin to cover their costs. Stop it. be considerate. understand the outfitters costs and expenses and loss of income. I can understand dropping a person due to something unforseen, but booking trip with 8 guys and 6 of them are not vaccinated up, and hoping for canada to change rules, doesn't fly in my book. You have committed fraud plain and simple. if you want to have lodge to go to with your son/grandson in 10 yrs, be considerate of owners needs today. Don't book if you can't get there with todays rules. if the rules change next week, then by all means adapt to those changes whatever they may be."
6675176,Old Timer,2022-07-25 14:20:00,255,Kim: What you bring up is happening all over. I just returned from a trip where the camp was half-full because of last minute cancellations or no-shows. Now I'm booking a trip for early August and having no problem getting a cabin for the same reason. Before Covid these camps were full all summer and we're looking forward to a better year after being closed for almost two years. It's not happening because guests are bailing on their trips and in some cases demanding their deposits back. I've spoken to two other operators and have heard the same thing. It's all very unfair.
6675178,Cgillespie,2022-07-25 14:50:00,120,"I really feel for these lodge owners who are being jerked around by inconsiderate guests. If you refuse to get the Covid shot, then don't plan a trip to Canada. It's pretty plain and simple. They aren't going to change the rules anytime soon, so get used to it. It's not even an inconvenience to get the shot. I guess I'm just a simple fisherman who loves Canadian fishing, I don't understand why somebody would let that shot stop them from going."
6675182,Bigtaproot,2022-07-25 15:12:00,900,"If I was an outfitter, I would demand all the money in advance. In fairness to the customer, the outfitter would not be able to slip in a ""fuel surcharge"" and I would not expect a refund should the cost of fuel go down between the time of the booking and the fishing date. Just was at a resort for the 10th time and the service has really decreased in quality. Same excuses we hear from everywhere else: staffing issues, supply chain, inflation ..........."
6675194,eyecatcher1,2022-07-25 16:37:00,323,I agree! I had to cancel my June trip due to my wife's illness on short notice. The resort agreed to let me move my deposit to a different date as long as it was this year since they were keeping deposits from those who cancelled on short notice for other reasons. Probably cancellations because people were unvaccinated. I didn't ask.
6675200,kettyspanky,2022-07-25 17:03:00,271,I agree with you all. It sucks for the resort owners. I was in canada last week and the resort was half full. I usually see 20-30 boats a day out fishing. This year I saw 6 boats. I'm not sure the reasoning but I guess there will be more fish for me next year. I hope all the resorts can make it this year and beyond.
6675214,That Minnesota guy,2022-07-25 17:57:00,8293,"If I was looking to book a Canadian trip next year I would look for larger deposit requirements. These lodge owners aren't stupid, they will up the deposit and make it valid for 1 calendar year. Refunds will be a thing of the past."
6675216,SweetD,2022-07-25 18:11:00,243,Kim nailed it! Our outfitter had two openings on a very popular outpost lake due to cancellations related to reservation holders who had not had Covid vaccination. I could give a rip whether or not you have had a vaccination or not but to take a reservation knowing that the current rules don’t allow entry is ignorant and inexcusable. The outfitters should maintain a blacklist database of clients that jacked them and either not accept them for future trips or require full payment for all reservations made by anyone on that list. Unfortunately the rest of the “good guys” out there will have to pay the price for these bums and thugs!!!! I am OK with that provided it is in the best interest of the outfitters not getting jacked by these losers.
6675238,Old Timer,2022-07-25 19:27:00,255,A few observations: 1. LOTW is one of my go-to lakes. Ten days ago I saw far fewer boats than in years past. 2. One Ontario lodge is requiring a deposit of payment in full. No refunds. The lodge recommends that guests purchase trip insurance. Probably been burned by no-shows. 3. These are easy times to book a trip. For years you had to park a deposit six to twelve months in advance to save dates. Not now. Except for maybe June dates you can just about call and go at your own convenience. These are strange times that don't fare well for the Canadian resort industry. I suspect everybody will be paying the price down the road guests included.
6675242,That Minnesota guy,2022-07-25 19:37:00,8293,"First off, I'm all for Canada running Canada and doing what they believe is in their best interest. This is a question for the Resort / Lodge / Camp owners. I'm assuming there is a resort association of some sort in Ontario that you all belong to. Has there been any indication from the government what the future holds? I'm sure you have a lobbyist or 2 in Ottawa. Any news on if there will be financial relief for this COVID debacle or will the resorts be on their own to struggle through?"
