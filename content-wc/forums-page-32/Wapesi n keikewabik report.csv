6680392,prov1800,2022-08-19 08:06:00,5010,One day you'll have to get out of kindergarten and fish the big lakes with the big boys and get some size.lol.
6680440,danvan18$,2022-08-19 10:52:00,67,"Rod- glad you enjoyed Keike- same last September- they were very aggressive and fat. We didn't get to fish the South end due to high wind, but would of liked to. Did you make to the weed bed near where the river comes in?"
6680446,Eckohlt,2022-08-19 11:06:00,3685,"There were weed beds everywhere and I really couldn't see where exactly the river came in,really didn't need to go that far,could have paddled out in front of the cabin and to the right and caught all the fish you wanted.But ya great fishing and nice cabin even the mice like to shack up there also.So next year cpls trip to Otatakan July 30."
6680452,Eckohlt,2022-08-19 11:08:00,3685,"I've fished the big lake many times and I got sick of seeing so many big boys,I'd rather reduce the size and not see anyone."
6680454,danvan18$,2022-08-19 11:12:00,67,The river comes in way down at the South end and Yes that area was loaded as well last fall. We will be going back To Otatakan in early June.
6680456,Eckohlt,2022-08-19 11:28:00,3685,"No stairs at Otatakan,carrying all the stuff up the stairs at Keike in hot weather is enough to kill ya lol,I usually swim everyday but there was a huge algae bloom on the lake I didn't feel safe swimming in split pea soup.I mostly picked Otatakan for the cabin the gals will like it for sure."
6680458,prov1800,2022-08-19 11:53:00,5010,Big lakes many places to go and don't see anyone.Small camps could have 10+ boats on the lake.more than I see.Especially in the rain.lol.Hardly saw a boat in the 3 days we were out in it. lol.
6680498,Eckohlt,2022-08-19 13:34:00,3685,"I may pick wine lake late next sept,I'm not sure if that qualify as a big boy lake or little boy??"
6680512,prov1800,2022-08-19 14:08:00,5010,I'd classify it as small but would be fun lake.
