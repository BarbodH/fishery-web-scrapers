6679036,dakota eye,2022-08-11 20:09:00,69,Coming back up to fish Lac Seul John. Have the fish finally gone deeper up there? They were quite shallow a couple of weeks ago. Thx!
6679040,RichA$1970,2022-08-11 20:18:00,1159,That’s a big girl and what lure to you catch her with? I’m in the minority but I could fish for pike all day.
6679078,prov1800,2022-08-12 06:20:00,5010,Finally starting to head deeper.But you know LS always has shallow fish I find all season.
6679080,prov1800,2022-08-12 06:26:00,5010,"3/8 Oz jig and minnow Rich.20 ft deep on main lake hump.Must say Clay lake has some good pike my buddy had his guests trolling triple D s and the the got 3 38"" that day."
6679154,Lac Seul John,2022-08-12 13:00:00,31,Current makes sense! Thanks
6679156,Lac Seul John,2022-08-12 13:01:00,31,I will be up there a week from Sunday out of Mahkwa. I really don't know that part of the lake so good - so hope we can figure it out.
6679166,prov1800,2022-08-12 13:44:00,5010,Iam sure camp will point you in right direction.But LS easy to fish as if it looks good ot probably is
6679202,prov1800,2022-08-12 20:45:00,5010,Other decent pike from Clay Lake
6679208,prov1800,2022-08-12 21:05:00,5010,Another decent one.

6678592,prov1800,2022-08-09 20:55:00,5010,Had to share this pic for all the pike lovers.Been bounching from lake to lake and enjoying them all.Fishing is still fantastic and so easy to catch them.walleyes generally shallow for this time off the year.Clay Lake was crazy last week with 3 days and 30 dozen minnows gone.Yesterday again with new party and cleaned up 4 doz today on Cedar by noon.Muskie fished with 2 rookies and they got to see 4 muskies and we had a muskie on a walleye this we almost got in the next.Very windy today with 40 km winds.Both lakes not that busy with boats.Guided from Cedar Point Resort on Sunday and showed them some great walleye fishing and some pretty good crappie fishing to.Blueberry patches are loaded and easy pickings like the fishing.
6678612,PRO-V16,2022-08-09 22:05:00,454,Very nice. Thanks for the pictures.
6678614,Eckohlt,2022-08-09 22:25:00,3685,"The fish pics don't excite me,but that pie picture got my mouth watering lol,on my way up in 2 hrs,looks like some good weather for the week,keep slaying them john."
6678628,prov1800,2022-08-10 04:09:00,5010,Try my best.heres another good fish caught by Jeremy.One of Clark's pilots picking up guests at the daily flyin at Zizania Lake.
6678630,Walleye2242,2022-08-10 04:11:00,263,What does Clark charge for his daily fly outs? We use to do those when they were Doug gawleys long ago. fished Zizania long ago. they were all incredible fishing. Back then was like 125.00 per person.
6678632,prov1800,2022-08-10 04:20:00,5010,250 person now.Still all great lakes.Zizania still amazing.All catch and release now
6678652,Bill Krejca,2022-08-10 06:48:00,6107,Life is good!! Bill
6678814,prov1800,2022-08-10 20:26:00,5010,Sure is Bill.Not complaining.Had another good day on Clay Lake.8 dozen minnows gone around noon then cast rest of day.One more day with these folks and will be on Eagle for a casting day.
6678924,Lac Seul John,2022-08-11 10:07:00,31,Great report and pics. Looks like alot of fun! Looks like you are getting those walleye's close to shore & in shallower water. I would think they would have pushed deeper by now...
6679012,prov1800,2022-08-11 17:06:00,5010,We have been getting them in main lake deeper and some other deeper water areas but in the narrower areas we get them from 8-14 ft with the current which is pretty fast still.Need 3/8 Oz jigs to get it down
