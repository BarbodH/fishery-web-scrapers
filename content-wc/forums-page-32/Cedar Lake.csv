6679536,prov1800,2022-08-15 05:22:00,5010,Rained good here to last night.Still spitting this morning.Just pulled plug on boat and quite a bit of water came out and it was dry before..lol.Picking up some guests this morning at the Pine Grove Motel and will decide where we are going today.Rain gear kinda day.
6679878,prov1800,2022-08-16 20:33:00,5010,So far lots of rain.Yesterday on Cedar and today Clay Lake.Today Clay main lake had some huge rollers so bit of rough ride.Fishing both days has been very good.Cedar produced lots of smaller pike and although we didn't walleye fish more than half hour it was a hot bite.Had 4 muskies to the boat also but no hook up.Clay was very good today with many pike a few good ones.walleyes were really good but I was only one fishing them as my Alabama boys kept casting.Very wet today and we decided to get of the water at 2.Radar showed a bad system moving toward us.Tomorow daily flyout to Zizania but will be mostly a casting day.
