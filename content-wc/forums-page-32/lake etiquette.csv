6680916,hey load,2022-08-21 06:46:00,16,"Five years ago my wife and I were fishing for walleyes in LOTW. We were drifting between two humps (the humps were 15 feet and dropped to 25 between them). The breeze was perfect to set up the drift. Two other boats pull up and set up the same drift about 50 yards away . . . it was nice. We didn't know them but they introduced themselves as they passed and we were having nice conversations between drifts. A big Ranger with four guys started watching the three of us catch fish and decided to barge in and park in the middle of the drop and jig. We had just finished our drift and were idling back up when they did this; one of the boats in our little group asked what were they doing and got the old ""you don't own the lake, I'll fish where I want, etc etc . . . and then they got really nasty with the language. The other two boats just left and I was thinking we should, too; big lake, we know it well and we'll find other places to fish. Not worth the confrontation in my eyes. Next thing I know my wife has jumped in the driver's seat, cranked the motor, and started doing circles around the Ranger. She stayed about 25 yards off and never got close and never on plane, but going fast enough to rock the Ranger pretty good. They were yelling all kinds of bad words and she was just laughing . . . and circling . . . and laughing . . . for about ten minutes, then they packed up and left. My wife is SERIOUS about her fishing. One of the many things I love about her."
6680936,Obabikon,2022-08-21 07:59:00,2370,Many fishermen are used to fishing crowded lakes near cities. Fishing side by side is common. They don't realize how incredibly rude it is when the lake isn't packed with anglers.
6680940,Eckohlt,2022-08-21 08:14:00,3685,Goes to show you don't need a ranger to find fish!
6680946,REG,2022-08-21 08:50:00,445,"If I can cast toward the other boat - and they can cast toward me and our casts can't overlap, we're ok. Not ideal as there is plenty of water and plenty of fish so that you don't need to be that close. Sometimes we have multiple boats in our cabin and we might enjoy fishing close enough to each other that we can talk as well as fish. The problem with that is that it almost always draws others in since they assume we are on ""the spot"" I was sitting on a spot that was about a cast away from the shore once. And we were catching a few. Next thing I know a boat trolls between me and the shore.. Idiots."
6680950,Bakefish,2022-08-21 08:57:00,1077,Try the Detroit River for the spring walleye run. We call it combat fishing. Fishing is incredible and I'll never do it again.
6680960,7 Mag,2022-08-21 09:24:00,1887,"This past June my wife and I were anchored and fishing a large flat in Northern Mn, we were catching a mix of walleyes and perch. There was a pontoon with 4 older men anchored about 100 yards from us and they must of seen us catching fish. It wasn’t long before they motored around the back side of us and anchored right on top of the spot we were fishing, they were so close I could of cast over top of them. I don’t think I’ve ever been that pi***d before so the words out of my mouth began to flow, even my wife chimed in. Guess what, they never acknowledged us, never said a word back and kept fishing our spot and caught fish, I even bounced a jig off their pontoon, no comments from them. I have a hard time understanding what’s happened to common courtesy amongst outdoorsmen and women, it used to be we were somewhat of a brotherhood, both hunters and fishermen for the most part respected one another. I think there’s a lot of good people still showing courtesy but the number of idiots seem to be growing."
6680830,Walleye2242,2022-08-20 16:12:00,263,I had 2 situations happen this past week that shocked me. One morning i was on a small island point and catching walleyes. A boat of 4 stopped and watched me and saw fish being caught. I saw them drive in behind me and watch more. No worries as i was just drifting this small point. So i am drifting and the next thing i know my front of my boats hits something...i was like what heck...looked back and they were right there and trolled into the front of my boat. i couldnt believe it. he looked at me said...hey..how are ya...i said i was doing fine but would appreciate some room to fish and he got pissed and told me this was not my lake. It is not my lake and its not my island and i highly doubt i am the only guy catching fish on the lake but some respect would have been nice. Also had a situation on another island that i know very well....a huge boat(300 HP lund) was fishing calm side...i went to windy side and set up in about 15 feet of the wind blown point...started catching walleye...his boat was watching me as they were not catching anything. next thing is he fires up and parks about 10 feet in front me and starts drifting back. Was unbelievable. I know the lake is not mine and i have fished spots with other boats but would never get close to them especially to actually hit boats.
6680832,drew59,2022-08-20 16:39:00,87,I'm pretty easy going when it comes to people moving in on me. 50 - 75 yards is ok with me but I won't move in that close to someone else. What you are describing is 100% rude. Sign of the times I'm afraid.
6680838,prov1800,2022-08-20 16:53:00,5010,I wouldn't put up with that s**t.No way.someone going move and it won't be me.if I see those kinda assh*les coming my muskie rod with top raider comes out.Few cast in the boat on the boat they catch on.
6680840,kettyspanky,2022-08-20 17:18:00,271,"Yes I agree with the rest. Just plain rude. I am usually pretty easy going also but, I'm pretty sure I would have come unglued and probably said something in the heat of battle to make them mad. Isn't there a rule or law of operating a boat x number of feet from another boat?"
6680844,RichA$1970,2022-08-20 18:04:00,1159,"Reminds me of Leech Lake and bumper boats. I’ll watch and if they are catching any to save it for another time when nobody is there, but that is BS."
6680846,Luckydawg13,2022-08-20 18:23:00,363,Yup I know that guy setup behind me when I was catfish dropped a 5oz river sinker next to him he left
6680848,Eckohlt,2022-08-20 18:28:00,3685,Thank god for float planes!!
6680856,prov1800,2022-08-20 19:30:00,5010,Nothing like a flyout.Hasn't happened often this year.But on Lac Suel had 5 guys in a ranger fish close to me.I had a few choice words for them they all told me were to go.lol.I yelled and said how'd you like me to ram my aluminum boat into that fancy fiberglass rig and see who comes out the worse.they did leave but who needs that kind of crap on a lake 110 MI long.After 2 years of no boats I got to get used to it again.Lac Suel I would rate the worst.
6680884,walleyeguy3,2022-08-20 22:43:00,42,"Spent the past week on Lac Seul and had two instances (in less than an hour) with Water Wheel guides buzzing us as they cruised across Manitou Narrows (north and east of Windigo Point). They had the entire bay to deal with but chose to pass between our boat and a small island that we were fishing near. There was nothing we could detect that marked the spot as their private waterway. It was our first venture that far south of McKenzie, so maybe their is a different set of rules in that part of the lake that we didn't know about. Both boat operators pretty much gave us a f*** you look and blew on by at full speed. To blow past us within 25-30 feet when you have the entire bay west of the little island we were fishing seemed unnecessary and extremely inconsiderate. Like was stated previously maybe this is just a sign of the times, but I didn't appreciate it then and won't forget the Silver Water Wheel a-hole guides anytime soon. I'll certainly warn any fellow fishermen thinking of venturing to this part of Lac Seul to watch out for them."
6680904,HeHooksHimself,2022-08-21 05:47:00,725,"Check out this post of mine from 2015. This is another good example of really poor boat etiquette. What is wrong with these people! Hooks Doc and I were fishing a narrows in the ""river"" part of Niven Bay. We were pretty tight to the shore as there was a drop off and we were walleye fishing. A boat was trolling up to us with planer boards turning twice before he got to us. Another boat came within sight and the other one went down the channel outside of us by about thirty feet. The one that was now in sight had been trolling down. It was a red crestliner with a windshield and four guys in it. Unbelievably, when they got to us the driver decided it would be a good idea to go between us and the shore, about 30 feet of space. Doc and I couldn't understand why he would do that but when he asked, ""how ya doin?"" I responded ""Well, we WERE doing ok.."" He said 'That's good."" They continued to fish the narrows and when they finally disappeared we had lunch, did some anchor fishing, did some drifting, we were all over the narrows. We had talked about the incident and wondered what was in the guys head! As we had covered the narrows we noticed that the depth was pretty consistent, some rises here and there but the whole channel was very navigable with no trouble spots outside the weeds. We stayed there for a few hours and the first boat that had passed returned. At that point we were anchored near a rock wall about 15"" away from it in about 17' of water. The first boat passed in the middle of the channel and slowed down to not disturb us. We thanked them with a tip of the cap and they were on their way. We were still in the same spot when the second boat came speeding around the corner and cut speed as he came up to us. We had been laughing when we chose this spot saying, that guy can't get behind us here. Yeah, he did. At exactly that time Doc was pulling up an eye, otherwise his line would have been cut. As he got near to us I said, ""Whats wrong with that side?!"" Then I called him an a-hole. His eyes got big and he yelled ""Theres rocks over there! (there weren't) Then he yelled at the top of his lungs as he passed us and until he got out of sight a chorus of FU's, Do You Think You Own the Lake's and a variety of swear words, some of which I haven't heard in years. We left not long after that and I was hoping we would see them again, just so we could give them wide berth and explain boating etiquette to them. Now, I am quite sure this jerk was a guide since as they had been loudly fishing down from us one of the other guys got a snag and he advised him to cut it saying, ""Don't worry about it, I have plenty of rods rigged up."" So if you know a camp that uses red crestliners with Yamaha motors (75hp?) I would like to report this guy. I have a guess since I was told a particular camp makes the long trip to Niven Bay regularly. If by some chance you were one of the other three guys in the boat with this guy, I hope your tip reflected the embarrassment you must have experienced from this noob. Hooks"
