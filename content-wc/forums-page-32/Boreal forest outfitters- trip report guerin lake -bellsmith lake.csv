The Border crossing was a breeze for this old married couple from New Jersey. We are not that tech savvy, but with some help from our Son and outfitter, it is honestly not that hard to fill out the ArriveCan. Of course you have to be vaxed. Waiting/ Hoping that will be changed anytime soon is not the way to go. Boreal Forest Outfitters ( BFO) is owned by a Wonderful young couple, Jason & Sue Booth. Our last several trips had been with Matticce Lake Outfitters (MLO) The Elliot Family. MLO sold off their smaller camps, some of which were acquired by BFO. Most of you know MLO has a stellar reputation, and with good reason. Their cabins, and Fishing are great, and their service is Excellent. First I want to Thank Jason & Sue for honoring our deposit and price, which was made almost 4 years ago. Second I am happy to report that BFO has been living up to the same excellent service we were accustomed to with MLO. Former MLO and new BFO clients will not be disappointed with their outpost camps. Our first week was back to Guerin Lake/ Attwood River for our third trip there. A great cabin, clean hot shower, good boats & motors, and plenty of ice! Hit the portage Lakes 3 days, all good fishing! The main lake was also good fishing. Almost wonder if the portages were worth all the work? We did land a 37"" Pike in the Austen Lake river section. You will not go hungry for Walleyes at Guerin Lake! Our Second week was a short jump over to Bellsmith, our first time. What a wonderful location on a beautiful point. All that Guerin has and then some. A perfect couples camp, beautiful detached shower house. In both camps everything was in very good condition. The gracious Elliotts were kind enough to send me a marked up map with good Fishing locations. The first night, our first stop was at a rocky west point, 12 feet deep, 20 yards from shore....We put meat on the boat! Left em biting! Fresh Walleye over rice, washed down with some Molson's Eh? Does it get any better? Both these camps offer an only cabin on the Lake Wilderness experience, you will only see the resident animals, and you will catch lots of fish! The Cabins are like staying at the Hilton! With an ice Machine!!! So happy to be back to Ontario! Very Happy with our new Outfitter! Shout out to the accommodating staff at Nakina Air."

6678318,vteye3,2022-08-08 18:37:00,496,Jason & Sue are excellent. We met them 3 trips ago and hoping to go back next year. The Booths have plowed money back into there camps. The camp we stayed at in June now has 2 solar refrigerators that work much better than propane models and reduce there costs = reasonable priced camps. Nice people
