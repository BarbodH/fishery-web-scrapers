6679046,pan-man,2022-08-11 20:45:00,299,Our group was 'lucky' last year to get test. We parked 50' from border crossing and did test there. We all had 3 different cell providers and had good signal there. I've crossed 4 times this year and have not got 'lucky' to get test this year.

6679072,gowrlop,2022-08-12 05:35:00,109,I pull up to the west side of the Auto Parts store where the Switch Health drop box is. I've done it twice and everything worked fine for me. I have Verizon.
6679098,lawson2343,2022-08-12 07:37:00,459,When were you last tested? I've crossed 3 times in July/August at Rainy so far and no tests. I'm wondering if they're still doing them.

6679164,Obabikon,2022-08-12 13:36:00,2370,"Random tests are pretty darn rare at this point. But, you can pull over just past the border, take the test, and then drop it off in front of Kreger's."
