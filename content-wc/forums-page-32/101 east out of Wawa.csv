6679822,kim n indiana,2022-08-16 14:17:00,62,"thanks..... its either over to 129 and go north, which is way we went 3 yrs ago, or go north and across on 101."
6679840,Dilligaf,2022-08-16 16:10:00,7,"If you've already been on 129 then you know why the first 100 kms or so are one of my favorite roads to drive! I'm only in a car though, I'm not sure I would want to drive that section while I was towing anything."
