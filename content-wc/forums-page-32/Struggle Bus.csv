6678888,Matcaz,2022-08-11 08:26:00,22,"I just returned from a four day trip to the Churchill River in Saskatchewan, a camp that I had been to about 15 times previously but always in June. I knew that fishing was going to be different in August compared to those previous June trips. I did some research on this forum, other articles and YouTube to prepare as best as I could. I was taking my wife, my four kids (all 18 or younger), my son's girlfriend, and grandma. So you can imagine how all the pressure was on me to get us on fish. I could not take my boat on this trip, so we had to rely on camp rentals that had no electronics. I did bring my Vexilar so I could at least monitor water depths. The cabins were clean and comfortable, the scenery and weather were beautiful, but the fishing was a total struggle. I tried points, islands, island saddles, bars, bays, etc. We jigged, bottom bounced, trolled cranks, and pitched paddle tails. The only places we managed to squeeze a few walleye out of were in areas of heavy current, fishing where we could find current breaks/eddies. We primarily fished 18-22 FOW. The 24 hour drive home I racked my brain on what I could have tried differently. The only thing I could come up with is that we didn't fish deep enough. Not having proper electronics was a limiting factor also. What's everyone's thoughts on what I was missing or could have done differently? Don't be afraid to be brutally honest with my failures. Thanks all"

I am not familiar with this body of water but some lakes the walleyes migrate extreme distances from spawning areas to summer locations. Along with other changes from year to year location may vary but location is still the key. I have used a Vexilar on many trips in the past but in today's world a graph would have been so much better. And with the low cost of 5"" graphs I would have went this route. Assuming that there are significant numbers of walleyes in this body of water the people operating this camp should have been the go to for location assistance. Surprising enough not all camp operators are in tune with the fishing...... In this case hopefully another customer at camp is doing better and is nice enough to offer some assistance."
6678906,Matcaz,2022-08-11 09:04:00,22,"The camp just changed hands and it was the first summer for the new owners. They are also not from the area and had not become knowledgeable with the river system yet. If fact, they were asking me about my spots from my past June trips to help others next year.No one else was in camp. We had the entire camp to ourselves. Perhaps that was an indicator from the start?Plenty of walleye in river. We never had problems filling limits, and never had to target them. They were always shallow and we would catch them incidentally while chasing large pike. 100 walleye days when not targeting them to me is a good walleye fishery. That is why I am so baffled?"
6678920,Obabikon,2022-08-11 09:51:00,2370,"Lake of the Woods this week has also fished very tough. Evening bite has been better, but still a struggle. High waters, unstable weather... has been making things challenging."
6678944,Old Timer,2022-08-11 11:11:00,255,"Matcaz: You obviously know the water system as you've been going up there for 15 years. Being brutally honest, I might have hired the best guide I could have found, especially when so many family members were depending on you. Lotta pressure right there. But then a good guide is no guarantee when the fish are slow to cooperate. It happens. Been there didn't like it."
6678948,Matcaz,2022-08-11 11:25:00,22,"Unfortunately, no guide services available at this camp. Otherwise I agree, that would have been the way to go. And with only myself having any experience fishing there, or Canada in general, they couldn't break off and try other areas. Divide and conquer so to speak."
6678996,valley366,2022-08-11 14:49:00,193,I would say electronics is the key. Does not have to be a big expensive system but a good unit that can mark fish. Since it sounds like you ice fish too I would look at the Lowrance or Bird Ice units and just add the ducer on it. This allows you to cover water a little quicker and figure where to fish and more importantly where not to fish.Last year due to the late opening with COVID we shifted to a late August trip from our normal early June slot. Same lake system but totally different fishing spots for the most part. This year we are going a week earlier than last year and expect the fishing to be kind of different but hopefully not as much searching if our Aug spots from last year pan out.Good luck
6679140,Mojo-NC,2022-08-12 12:30:00,1929,"I agree with valley366, electronics are the ticket to finding fish and if you're able to drop a waypoint it is a great way to get back to exactly where you found them. Other than early spring, our big fish always come from places where there is a quick transition from deep water to shallow water, especially near a channel. We focus on points where there is a fairly quick transition to deep water. Pay attention to the depth where you're catching fish and pull spinner rigs through areas that meet the criteria - mainly deep water shorelines and any shallow transitions close to deep water. Pull them along and try to follow the contour of the desired depth. When you catch a few in a specific area, jig it and try to figure out why they're there. Also focus on deep water humps during the summer months. Yes, you will waste some time on unproductive waters, but if you remember where the good spots are, you can go straight back to them later and skip the unproductive water. We fished new water this past July and the technique worked well for us."
6679162,Obabikon,2022-08-12 13:35:00,2370,"Electronics certainly wasn't the key last week here. You could watch all the fish all day... their mouths were wired shut. On another note, they have turned back on. Today was excellent fishing."
6679398,andreindy,2022-08-14 08:09:00,308,"I felt your pain when you described your situation and am the one the siblings, nephews will turn to to devise a plan. As I teach them, this will change, but right now it is what it is. But the pressure is very real...probably and mostly placed on me by me. That being said, a simple Helix 5 is an amazing tool. The ability to mark GPS points. Find fish and bottom type. And for $100, you get the Zero Lines and can even create your own contour maps. For the cost and simplicity, I don't think I would venture without it. The other plus, is when adding waypoints I set it to take screen shots. I can then upload these screenshots to share with the guys and use them as teaching tools so they know what I am looking for. Our Canada trip was very successful, but my Wisconsin trip to Lac du Flambeau and Fence Lake that I literally just returned from was just like you described: A complete struggle bus. Never been there. Really clear lake. Sunny sky. I couldn't figure it out with the few hours a day I had allotted for fishing. Didn't catch a single walleye the entire trip. BUT, my kids had the funnest time catching tiny perch with little jigs and seeing them happy made me happy and I had to put my inner walleye angler to rest."
