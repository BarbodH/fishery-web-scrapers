6679604,Iowa4ND,2022-08-15 09:54:00,35,"That is an awesome fish, our best from the group so fare is 42"". The thought of a 50"" fish lurky i there keeps bringing us back."
6679834,BuckeyeATC,2022-08-16 15:28:00,88,The outpost on Nungesser is actually run by https://www.bobgreensfishingcamps.com/. Been to Nungesser quite a few times. There are actually like 5 camps on Nungesser now. Not nearly as remote and peaceful as it used to be. Birch Point Nungesser Lake Lodge Angler's Kingdom Bob Green's Camp Goose Bay outpost
6672860,Spurgery,2022-07-15 12:07:00,79,"As far as the landscape goes, yes it got quite crispy surrounding camp and up and down both sides of the lake. A few islands even burnt."
6672866,Iowa4ND,2022-07-15 12:31:00,35,"See you up there, safe travels."
6674008,Iowa4ND,2022-07-20 06:38:00,35,Ever due the portage into Farrar Lake? We have not but 2 of us might this year. Something to do in middle of the day when bite might slack off.
6674012,Spurgery,2022-07-20 06:50:00,79,I haven’t ever fished Farr. You might need to check with Matt to confirm that they have it open. It was not when we were there back in late May due to extremely high water levels. With the high water we were able to easily motor into Rosie Lake which is on the front side of South Bay. Not sure if much will be in there come august as it’s only about 20 feet deep at deepest point.
6674320,Iowa4ND,2022-07-21 14:56:00,35,"We went into Rosie last time we were up-- can't believe it was 2017. Like you said, not alot going on in August but was neat just checking it out. Be nice to have plenty of water to navigate. Have a 1st timer this time so I bet we try again just for the heck of it. Won't spend much time in there unless something has changed drastically."
6679418,Iowa4ND,2022-08-14 10:31:00,35,"Had a great trip up to Nungesser Lake Lodge Aug 5-12th with 10 guys. Weather was a little warm a couple days and several very windy days with it staight out of the west but we were able to find some sheltered areas. Many walleye in the 22"" to 25"" range , best walleye was 26"". Largest Northern was 37"". I thought numbers were very good, had to work hard on some days but the regular spots produced as usual. Most productive for large walleye was the North side of Gullrock Matt and Janelle are busy making alot of updates and run a great resort. Had an impeller issue on one boat the first morning and Matt had it replaced and back on the water 25 minutes after we had pulled back in to the dock. They are very accessible and were always near the docks in the morning when leaving and evening coming back in. I'd recommend a trip to NLL for anyone looking for a good boat in trip. Had a great breakfast at Whistle Stop Cafe in Hinkley MN on the way up. Fast, good food and good service. No major roadwork on the way up which was great. Only negative was the amount of cans and trash we found left around the shore lunch sites. Picked up as many as we could but a litte ridiculous people can't leave spots as good or better than they found them."
6679420,walleyecheek,2022-08-14 10:49:00,2231,I see they already changed their deposit for 2023.
6679430,walleyecheek,2022-08-14 11:44:00,2231,Deposit requirements.
6679476,Iowa4ND,2022-08-14 15:05:00,35,"Yep, I think that has been posted for several weeks now for them. Didn't get into an in-depth conversation but they did say cancellations this year have been hit them. We go every other year so not sure what 2024 will hold in that regard."
6679542,Rondogpike1,2022-08-15 05:42:00,5,"We fished it a few years ago with Green Airways. My buddy Jeff boated a beast of a pike (46 1/4"") that is on their website still today:https://www.jackgreensflyincamps.com/"
6632748,Walleye2242,2022-02-12 09:25:00,263,"Any info on Nungesser lake, north of red lake i believe? Fishing and cabins and such? Thank you all."
6632754,Eckohlt,2022-02-12 09:37:00,3685,"Do a search in this forum,tons of info on that lake,just type in the name of the lake in the search box."
6632788,Walleye2242,2022-02-12 12:18:00,263,Will do...Thank you.
6632832,Pooch,2022-02-12 14:42:00,4618,"I think the lake has a couple camps and a few outpost cabins on it. There was a lot of chatter here on WC a few years ago, so search. Be specific to the camp or outpost you're looking at for better information.Fishing reports were pretty good if I remember correctly.Pooch"
6632836,RichA$1970,2022-02-12 14:54:00,1159,"Look at Matt and Janelle’s on Numgesser. I’ve talked to him before and he was not a salesman, seemed legit and a local guy who lives up there year round."
6634086,Eyesore99,2022-02-16 15:37:00,5,"I've been to Birch Point Camp twice and hope to go again late this summer. The walleye fishing has been exceptional both times and there are big pike as well. Our group caught three trophies in one day a few years back. A 24lb, and a 25lb and a 20lb pike. Great lake"
6672666,JMKC,2022-07-14 16:34:00,238,Heard that camp owner Roy Green passed away at the end of June.
6672710,Spurgery,2022-07-14 20:22:00,79,"Numgesser is a Great Lake. Been there several times. Twice this year. Once back in late May and again in a couple weeks. 3 camps on the lake but it’s a big system. About 30,000 acres I believe. Nungesser lake lodge is my go ti. Yes, sadly Roy from Birch Point passed away a couple weeks ago."
6672856,Iowa4ND,2022-07-15 11:54:00,35,"We go in August 5th. 1st trip back since 2017, to say the group is anxious to get up there and have the first shore lunch is an understatement. Interested to see how its run now under Matt and Janelle. Also interested to see how the landscape has changed from the fires. As said, Nungesser is a great lake and worth the drive up. Last trip wrecked the brother in law, it was his 1st Canada trip and his 1st pike was a 42+ inch fish, his expectations are going to be hard to meet going forward."
6672858,Spurgery,2022-07-15 11:57:00,79,Will see you in camp. I will be arriving august 5th as well. You will like Matt and Janelle. They run a good quality business/camp.
