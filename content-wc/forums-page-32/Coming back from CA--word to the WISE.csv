We had all the Arrive Can paperwork done, with some effort, and crossed going North easily. Bought our leeches and crawlers there, had a great fishing experience at Lac Seul. Used up the leeches. When we returned to Rainy River headed South, one of the last questions was ""any fish or bait with you?"" They made us dump the best looking crawlers we have seen in a long time, ON THE LAWN AT THE CROSSING OFFICE. <strong>Can't bring any bait purchased in Canada back to the USA"".......</strong> Had I known this, I would have made other arrangements to sell or give them to another angler."
6679364,Wrktfsh,2022-08-14 05:24:00,492,Make me wonder why I'm buying crawlers in dirt from Ortons in Walker ..the boxes are labeled Product of Canada
6679372,walleyecheek,2022-08-14 05:59:00,2231,"so are the ones you buy at wally world in the USA........""Canadian Crawlers"".........Lol."

6679388,reddemon2,2022-08-14 07:39:00,255,"Well that's a no brainer, You know there is that saying, Can't ... ......."
6679886,PRO-V16,2022-08-16 22:10:00,454,Ive never even heard of anyone trying to bring back bait. Thought this was common knowledge.
6679928,phishfearme,2022-08-17 07:26:00,1242,"customs are not worried about the actual crawlers - it's the dirt/bedding they are housed in that's the problem. and in any event, night crawlers are invasive species - there's a large move afoot to limit their spread:https://wormwatch.d.umn.edu/join-team/stop-spread phish"
6679934,walleyecheek,2022-08-17 08:10:00,2231,"Sorry, not buying it ! How about frozen minnows ? Are they ok to take if i get the Dirt off them !!!!.......LOL."
6679946,1shooter,2022-08-17 08:55:00,1493,up until the new rule change we have brought left over crawlers back for over 20 years. Just assume the new rules applied to the US too so we didnt even bother trying.
6679970,proguidedream,2022-08-17 11:51:00,345,"you cant even take frozen bait from kenora to toronto now.. let along ontario to manitoba or USA.. going either way. unles it is frozen from a salt water species, like a grocery store northern pike bait"
