6680058,dosxx,2022-08-17 18:50:00,60,Thanks so much for the info on Tennant lake. I’ll definitely keep it on our list.
6677378,dosxx,2022-08-04 06:02:00,60,"Our group is ready to do a fly in again for next year after multiple years of boat in and drive ins. I have a few lakes in mind but can’t find much recent information in the search function.We are planning a late August trip for 2023.Potential lakes are Marshall with SLW and Tennant, Relief, Saga, Poverty, and Anckorn all with TLO.All of these lakes were chosen mainly because they are the only cabin on the lake. A few have River access but I’m wondering if a typical late August will have water too low to go exploring.Thanks in advance for any information. PM’s are welcome."
6677410,Stickman8474,2022-08-04 10:29:00,39,"Can't add any information on the mentioned lakes but you might consider Boreal Forest Outfitters or Luenbergers, both out of Nakina. They each have ""only cabin"" on lake locations. Can personally vouch for BFO as quality outfitter. We were at BFO's Melchett camp last year and had the water to ourselves. Returning again this year. We place high value on being the only camp on the lake, too."
6677422,fsz,2022-08-04 12:11:00,144,The outfitter cabin on Marshall is not the only cabin on the lake. There is a private cabin also.
6677426,dosxx,2022-08-04 13:41:00,60,Thanks for the info on the private cabin.
6677434,SweetD,2022-08-04 15:05:00,243,"We found there to be more private cabins than we had expected on Lake St Joseph this year towards the West end of the lake. The fishing was tremendous regardless so not a big deal for us. With that said and if you desire a truly only camp/cabin/boat-canoe traffic on a lake you better ask very clear and concise questions or you may be scratching your head when you arrive and find multiple private cabins, natives buzzing up and down the lake with 15-20 boats parked around the cove from you and/or canoe travelers tenting in various places on your “private only cabin on the lake” advertised outpost.Good luck with your search."
6677444,bester,2022-08-04 19:06:00,18,I highly recommend Boreal forest outfitters as well. We will be returning to Melchett for our 3rd time next Friday for a week. Any chance your flying in on the 19th Stickman?
6677486,Stickman8474,2022-08-05 03:09:00,39,"No, I'll miss you at the dock by one week. We'll be flying into camp on the 26th. Let me know how you make out."
6677684,bester,2022-08-06 14:00:00,18,"will do for sure, would've put a pot of coffee on for your arrival"
6678848,onetimedave,2022-08-11 04:56:00,502,The earlier in June the better. Jas & Sue are great hosts. All their lakes good.
6679636,Spartan1,2022-08-15 12:47:00,46,"Just returned from Tennant last Friday. A very nice lake and Chad from Twin Lakes does a great job. The cabin isn't that old and it is in good shape. My son and I fished for the week and caught 718 walleye and about 50 pike. We would have done far better but strong winds were a factor. I will absolutely return to the this lake. We rarely fished the river but I know there are a ton of good holes that we needed to explore. Caught a majority of our fish on plastics. Rarely used any live bait. The water level on the lake was 4 foot higher than normal so it made finding some of the typical spots a little more difficult. Most of the walleye were 18-22 inch range with our largest being 24. Largest pike was 39.75. As I noted, I will definitely go back! I hope this helps."
