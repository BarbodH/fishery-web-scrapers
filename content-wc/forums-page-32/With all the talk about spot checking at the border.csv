6679776,wmd,2022-08-16 09:09:00,388,My wife and I crossed at North Portal Saskatchewan yesterday. No questions about Covid spent no more than a minute at the window. Might have been the quickest crossing ever for me. wmd
6679794,Ogoki,2022-08-16 10:41:00,291,"Crossed at the Soo , 2 hours ago. We were only truck entering . No random box and as easy as we ever crossed . Very polite agent too."
6680192,pattmit,2022-08-18 08:51:00,36,"Wondering what everyone’s thoughts are on taking CBDFreeze across? Here is a picture of the bottle and ingredients. I used this for my elbow pain I’ve been having. It’s similar to bio freeze or icy hot and THC free. I’m perfectly ok throwing it away if we do get spot checked, just don’t want any issues with bringing it across because of what’s in the “ingredients”. Hopefully I don’t open a can of worms lol"

6680414,pattmit,2022-08-19 09:08:00,36,So the simple answer is no - don’t mess with it. Quite a bit to read and hoops to jump through.
6680496,proguidedream,2022-08-19 13:33:00,345,"stuff is legal up here now, if you are driving thru there is lots of shops. if your flying in it would depend on the lodge if they would add whatever you request to the grocery list"
6680568,prov1800,2022-08-19 18:06:00,5010,We all know what happened to them.I drove a buddies truck to Iowa once and when I showed my passport was questioned about why I had that truck.as it came up with a diff name.So they know.
6678250,C182P,2022-08-08 15:00:00,59,We crossed through Fort Francis Friday July 29 and the truck in front of us got handed the dreaded random test box. So as of last week they still had some presents for the lucky few.
6678322,kona77,2022-08-08 18:39:00,236,"Our group did not get the test back in June, but I have never seen so many cars/trucks pulled over in the lanes right after you get thru the check-in/border area. Assumed some were getting tests. I hope this is not seen as hijacking the thread but I have seen some guys report on a separate Outdoor site that due to various reasons they did not bother taking the random tests. Of course they were allowed back in the US at the end of their trips but I assume this would send a red flag up in Arrive/Can?? May impact their ability to get back into Canada but have not seen any data on this.. Does anyone happen to know what happens if you just skip taking the random test ??"
6678344,RichA$1970,2022-08-08 19:12:00,1159,"I knew a guy who went to their camp and he said they treated their staff like crap and it was a “you get what you pay for” type trip. Baffles me if you own a camp and a non resident, you are pretty much F’d into getting the vax and they tried to sneak it, wonder how much that cost them."
6678348,jax833,2022-08-08 19:39:00,43,"humm? i'm pretty sure wisconsin doesn't share a boarder with canada or even close enough to worry about getting a ""remote access pass"""
6678428,AsianAngler,2022-08-09 07:54:00,67,"We got the dreaded boxes back when the border first opened. It was a mess. Hopefully, things have improved since then. We were told to go to a McDonald's parking lot and log onto the system. We crossed around Noon, and the system was so busy the message said to try again around 7 PM. We took the risk and went to our cabin even though internet is spotty there. We got on around 8 PM and they had a person walk you through the test so that they can monitor to ensure you are doing it correctly. The test has to be sent via Purolator delivery service, so my husband had to drive 40 mins each way, to get them to the closest Purolator drop off. Otherwise, I heard the government will send a Purolator courier to pick up the tests. Hard to believe that they just didn't post a person at each border crossing to do the tests and collect the samples.This plan had to be devised by some office worker in Ottawa who never was in the remote areas of Canada. Pray it works well, if you are unlucky enough to receive."
6678462,Old Timer,2022-08-09 09:49:00,255,"I suppose readers here are not surprised that I'm weighing in on this thread. I've made five trips to Canada and our group has been tagged twice for randoms. I'll assure you it's no fun, especially after making a long drive to the border and intending to drop some serious coin at a lodge or outpost. I've posted my experience on other threads. I agree with AsianAngler, Switch Health should have staff person right at the customs station or nearby to help one-on-one with the testing process."
6679250,farmnfish,2022-08-13 09:26:00,130,"Given new cdc directives, testing makes much more sense that vaccination requirements."
6679324,KC Walleye,2022-08-13 19:38:00,274,"It always did!! Even with previous CDC guidelines. But, Canada can do Canada. My opinion matters not."
6679726,martinbns,2022-08-15 21:20:00,1520,"We crossed through the US on July 27th, back into Canada the next morning in SSM, back again through the Sault on Aug 3 back into MB on the 4th. My wife was randomly selected for a test, she did it by facetime with the tech, the lab picked it up off our step the same day and she got her negative result two days later. Because she was vaccinated, she didn't have to do anything. A positive test she would have to isolate for 5 days."
6679762,bode,2022-08-16 07:42:00,39,"we crossed at pigeon river Friday afternoon August 5th. 5 cars ahead did not see any kits handed out. We did not receive a kit either. I timed each vehicle ahead of us averaged about 2 to 3 minutes to get through. A worker at Rydens said he didn't think they were handing out test kits, not sure how he would know and didn't ask. Quickest crossing in 46 years."
6677694,Pooch,2022-08-06 14:29:00,4618,Has anyone actually and recently been given the dreaded random spot test when crossing?Pooch
6677746,Skywagon,2022-08-06 16:09:00,1106,"A spot check of sorts. Local rumor has it that a Wisconsin tourist camp operator on Dinorwic lake and their spouse tried to slip across the border this spring with bogus Covid tests and they were caught by the border guard. Everyone that I have talked to say they are suspended from coming back to Canada for two years, I did not hear what the fine was."
6677760,Eckohlt,2022-08-06 16:42:00,3685,"Ya can't pull the wool over there eyes at the border,crime doesn't pay."
6677868,Skywagon,2022-08-07 05:52:00,1106,"The border crossing agents have technology they are using and more information on all of us when we cross then we realize. They certainly know details about us from our license plate before we pull up to the window. I would guess in this pair's case that because of past violations in Canada, a red flag goes up every time they crossed the border, somehow they made it across last year, but not this year."
6677878,RichA$1970,2022-08-07 07:27:00,1159,There was a husband and wife owners from WI on Dinorwic who got nailed on permit issues several years back. Would t surprise me if it was them again.
6677912,rpbadger,2022-08-07 09:50:00,22,Lee from Pickerel Arm Camp told me that not a single guest of his this year has gotten the random test
6677916,skindzier,2022-08-07 09:58:00,137,I got one crossing at Emerson/Pembina Manitoba on July 2nd.
6677952,Skywagon,2022-08-07 11:38:00,1106,"You have a good memory, it was the same ones."
6677958,Eckohlt,2022-08-07 11:51:00,3685,"They must be a cpl of dandy's,the Bonnie n Clyde of resort owners."
6678004,Bakefish,2022-08-07 16:07:00,1077,Imagine giving those two a 100% deposit.
