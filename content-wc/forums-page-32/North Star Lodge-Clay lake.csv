6680464,prov1800,2022-08-19 12:04:00,5010,Have been there a few times in last 2 weeks.Fish in the current areas are fairly shallow in 10-13 ft and you will need 1/4 to 3/8 jigs.We have been using minnows.there are reefs in Sequise Bay that are on fire.There hard to find so maybe if you can take out one of the guides there.But fishing the points and back bays still producing lots.reefs on main lake also very good and around the islands.West narrows always has fish and through Indian Dog narrows.
