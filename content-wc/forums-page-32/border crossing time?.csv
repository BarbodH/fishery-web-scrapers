We will be crossing at Int. Falls/Fort Francis heading for Sioux Narrows. Plannning on crossing Saturday afternoon. Does anyone have an idea of how long we might be in crossing. Wife and I are meeting relatives from Montana before crossing together so time depends on their arrival in the Falls. Also, if anyone has any insight to the fishing in LOW around the Whitefish Bay are this time of year I'd enjoy hearing your recommendations. It will be my first time in that part of the lake. Staying at Indianhead Lodge for a week. My cousin is hoping to hook into a pike/muskie on a fly...wish us luck!"

There were two lanes open, each with two cars waiting - wait time was less than 5 minutes. Boarder check took 60 seconds. The border Agent noticed my printed ArriveCan receipt on the console and did not ask further about it. HOWEVER... last Saturday around noon, when crossing back, we noticed the line going into Canada was backed up for blocks. Line returning to the US on Saturday was backed up past the bridge - about a 15-minute wait. US border agent took about a minute."
