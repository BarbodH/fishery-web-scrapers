Comparisons from last saturday to this saturday, the drum seem to be gone, which I find generally the walleye are right in behind them. The greenbacks are gradually getting bigger. Largest we caught was 23"" but we were catching more upward to this size. Water temp last sat 67F, yesterday 58F and only going to keep dropping with the weather forecast. W5"
1140057,otis,2009-10-04 11:18:00,20,"Glad to see things are starting to heat up,I will be leaving a week from Mon for the Red. What worked best for you guys jigs or cranks? Also how are the salties looking this fall."
1140116,RyanG,2009-10-04 20:00:00,16,"Any idea how high the water is? I know we have received quite a bit of rain and more is expected, I wonder how that will affect the rivers. I will be up there in 10 days, high water or not.Thanks"
1140329,Hawgeye,2009-10-05 23:22:00,1355,"I fished on Thursday through Sunday at Traverse Bay. We had a really good weekend catching good quantities of smaller greenbacks. My friend in the other boat caught a couple over 24"" and we had fish from 14 to 22. We had three really BIG fish on and lost all three. Could have been drum but I am sure they were all nice eyes because of the patented head shake. I estimate in our boat we caught 40-50 per day on Friday and Saturday, the two full days we fished. We cranked and found fish in 9 - 14 feet. Wish I could go in a couple weeks, fishing is pretty good and my guess only to get better."
1140374,Backwater Eddy,2009-10-06 08:11:00,3871,"The Breast Cancer fund raiser tournament last weekend on the Red yielded some nice fish, some over #10. Numbers sounded preaty good too, mixed bag, lots of smaller fish mixed in. If it does not muddy up too badly due to recent heavy rains to the South, it may be very good soon.I would try to catch it before the scheduled draw down, or wait a week or so after it."
1140625,trackerman,2009-10-07 09:38:00,20,When is the Scheduled Draw down?
1135371,Guest,2009-09-11 19:14:00,0,Any news yet? Has anyone ventured out to see if there are any walleyes around? I know the weather has been pretty warm but I feel the fish move in due to sun levels. How high is the water?
1135400,mrwalleye5,2009-09-11 21:44:00,1922,"The water is about 3 to 4 feet higher then normal. If you are familiar with Robson Rock in the bay, just the very top of the rocks are showing above the water. I was up 4 weeks ago and caught a good number of 16 to 18 inch walleye. Reports of bigger have been heard but I have not seen them personally. Talked to a local and he said a lot of the bigger fish seemed have forgotten to head out to the northern part of the lake this year. For me, I never get too excited until the water temperature starts dropping into the low 50's. It's around 67 right now. W5"
1136270,Hawgeye,2009-09-16 09:06:00,1355,"Yeah, sounds great. I always head up early October for my first trip and usually do pretty well. This year has been so warm that the water temps are likely up a bit. Keep the reports coming. Looking forward to catching some Greenies...water levels must be high. Anyone been out recently? I too am curious about the reports as I plan to head up in a couple weeks. Have any of you locals been catching in the river or are good fish mostly out in Traverse Bay? THanks for the report."
1137410,krenkey,2009-09-21 21:41:00,91,"Hi guys Local talkin here, was up at pinefalls on sunday fished the sand flats in Traverse Bay by the rockpiles in the middle, despite the 4 foot waves we managed to get 16 in total biggest being 23"" 5 greens in total and the rest lake walleye. We fished the usual spots in the river system to the rapids east of the launch with little saugers being caught no greens in the river yet the water is 1.5 degrees colder in the lake. If i can be any help shoot me an email [email protected] id be glad to share some spots if need be.Notice the green tint what a beautiful fish they were hitting live minnows better than salted and man did they taste good"
1137561,Hawgeye,2009-09-22 14:05:00,1355,"Krenkey THanks for the update. It sounds like there are some fish in the bay. That is encouraging with the water temps as high as they are...Going up weekend after next. Maybe the cooler nights will drive fish into the bay. 16 is a good quantity. Did you try any cranks? I assume you anchored and jigged by Robinson's Rock... Have you tried the Red near Selkirk at all? That always seems to heat up for about 2 weeks before they open up the flow in mid October. Thanks for the report, maybe see ya there!"
1137666,krenkey,2009-09-22 21:44:00,91,Fish selkirk a bit the greens arent in the river yet so i hit the mouth and can find a few.
1138657,krenkey,2009-09-27 09:48:00,91,"Well back from another outing at PF we kept 8 or 9 keepers 3 greens biggest being 19 to 20"" there were lots of boats out there tried a mix of shad's and jigs with jig's and live minnows working the best with the comming cold weather the fishing will get a lot better i did not fish the river only the bay. Happy fishing"
1139775,KEEBOY,2009-10-02 13:57:00,61,If anyone can give me an updated fishing report for this weekend Oct 3 and 4th that would be greatly appreciated. We have a trip planned for Oct 10-12. Also if anyone has any information on the Red River that would be helpful. Since we only have 3 days of fishing I want to make the most of our time. Thanks for any input.
1139869,Guest,2009-10-02 21:41:00,0,Was out there monday and caught a ton of little greens 16 to 18 inchers and there were also monster drum everywhere (good fight on light line) and 3 striped bass and one smallmouth bass going out this week will let you know if they are getting any bigger.More greens on cranks caught alot on jigs but with the jigs the drum were non stop
1140025,volksdriver,2009-10-04 08:02:00,18,"Friend and I fished the Red on Sept 30th/09...11am to 6pm.... (we were well north of Selkirk Park ).... nothing short of outstanding..... final count of GREENBACKS over 16 inches was 41 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also caught well over 15 MA bullheads...... way too many sauger and small walleye to keep count of...... throw in a few drum and white bass and have to say this was the BEST day I have ever had on the Red!Here are pictures of the 2 largest caught...... one a full 30"", the other 30 3/8""......Looks like they are in the river! Tournament this weekend should be a blast (unfortunate I cannot participate...... have to work! )Good luck to all ......http://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b3...w2sept3009.jpghttp://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b3...w1sept3009.jpg"
