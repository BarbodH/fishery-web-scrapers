I just checked and it Wabbiskang on it. The program has water depths for the lakes which is helpful. Fished this lake 3 years ago, very nice lake caught the largst perch I have ever seen."
1139966,trapper_john,2009-10-03 14:18:00,83,I wonder if they make a chip for my Lowrance? As far as the perch go. They saved a trip for us a few years back. We had found a few SM Bass and a few hammer handle slimers and that was about all. Then we hit on the jumbo's. Biggest was 13 but many 12 and we kept nothing under 10. Brought home almost two limits of them.. Most were caught right by the no wake markers by camp. Were did you find yours?
