1137535,jigpig50,2009-09-22 12:06:00,9,I am looking for anyone who might have gone brookie fishing in northeast Ontario. Our group strictly has gone fishing yearly for walleyes at both drive in and fly ins over the years. I have always wanted to combine both. I would appreciate any info as to where and who might have had the experience. thanks in advance.

It is a drive-to place, but the nice thing is that one of the camps you can utilize is pretty much off by itself without a whole cluster of camps nearby. This camp is on the shore of Mitchiminicus Reservoir (sp?). The reservoir has decent walleye fishing. There is a dam on the reservoir close by this camp, which spews cold water from the bottom of the reservoir into a small river....and that river is loaded with brook trout. It's a challenge to fish the river in that the banks are an amazing tangle of tag alders and hair-of-the-dog spruce. You have to wade the channel to fish it, and the bed of the river is all slippery, rounded rock and boulder...not for the faint of heart. We caught many 10-14"" beautiful , deep bodied brookies and a couple of 17-18""ers that weighed 2-3#s. A nice combo of walleye and brookie fishing. As a guest at Scotts , you can fish many miles of the river for brookies, have your camp and boat on the reservoir for fishing walleye, and also utilize 3 or 4 other lakes which you can drive to if you want. Maybe this is what you're looking for? Hope so. I can provide more info if needed."

Each year, we have caught COUNTLESS 20"" plus brookies on J-11 orange rapalas in the rapids of God's river. We have each caught several 45"" plus northerns in God's lake and one afternoon, Eric caught 4 walleyes in excess of 10 pounds each casting lucky craft pointer lures. We go the end of May just as ice is out. This year, I was talking to one of the locals and telling him how much I enjoyed catching the brookies on my 9' St. Croix wild river series rod and he told me to to with a very small jig and save a piece of cooked bacon from breakfast. Break off a tiny piece of bacon the let it sink in the slack water of the rapids and the brookies will tear it up. The Brookies really like bacon! Have fun and please try God's!"

If you read some of the previous threads it is one of the best brook trout fisheries in the world with some monster brookies. Search engine Lake Nipigon and you get a lot of info. I know there is only a couple of resorts on Nipigon itself, but, I know there are very good resorts in the area such as Pasha Lake Resort. The area is GREAT fishing. I have fished for years in the area. Nipigon is noted for its huge brookies, huge lakers, and monster pike. local lakes are teaming with walleyes. The area is as beautiful as any area in all of Canada. Good luck finding what you are looking for... Mike"
