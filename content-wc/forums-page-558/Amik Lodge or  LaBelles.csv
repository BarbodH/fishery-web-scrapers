If anyone has stayed at either, could you please give me your impressions: good, bad or otherwise. Any help would be appreciated. We stayed near Redgut last year and really enjoyed the accomodations but thought we might try a different area of the lake this year. thanks, again."

Highlights of my Amik Lodge experience and thoughts are:* Stayed one week last October. Excellent walleye fishing, I caught fish up to 29"" long.* Cabins are 2-3 years old, like new. They feature a deck with a gas grill.* Vince Allan, the owner, works extremely hard to ensure you are comfortable and have a great time.* The resorts consists of 3 cabins, ensuring peace, quiet and Vince's assistance.* The rates are extremely reasonable. * I enjoyed my stay so much last October that I am returning this July and will no doubt also return in October.Hopefully this helps,John Peterson.:cheers:"

564681,Guest,2007-04-20 15:30:00,0,I highly recommend Camp Narrows. It is in the heart of some great fishing. It's 8 miles by boat to the isolated resort on Northwest Bay and it's a great place to stay. The accommodations are nice and you're literally minutes away from some awesome fishing. Mike C

Vince Allan is a stand up guide with a great personality, good sense of humour and knowledge of the lake. Super quiet and calm surroundings. You'll never be sorry for chosing Amik Lodge, I'm there every summer. Jodie and Paul Brown"

It just has a unique feeling to it, imagine falling to sleep hearing the waves hitting the shoreline with the faint cry of the loon. And the fishing...OMG this is a big fish factory and those of you who love to catch and eat crappie....this is the place for you especially if you like catching 2-3lb crappies. Your within minutes of catching fish...literally. I will add a link so you can see some of the fish we caught not to far from Vince's camp.
