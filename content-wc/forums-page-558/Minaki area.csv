1137292,Guest,2009-09-21 15:32:00,0,"I don't think Cygnet Lake is a part of the Winnipeg River system that would be referrred to as ""Minaki"", but I could be wrong. The fishing on the Winnipeg River can be really good that time of year for all species. What species are you fishing for?"
1137452,NE IA Angler,2009-09-22 06:37:00,18,"Walleye, Northern and SM bass"
1138127,Guest,2009-09-24 15:17:00,0,Two guys I fish with have been going to Cygnet for 20 years. Email Bob at [email protected] or Tom at [email protected]. They can give you some info.

I camped there but I see that the new owners have updated cabins and added new ones. It has been about 10 years since I stayed there but I go by it every year when Im up there deer hunting. The lake is great for smalles notherns and walleyes, lake is good size with many bays. Brian"
