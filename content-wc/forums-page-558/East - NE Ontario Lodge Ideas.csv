1137624,Richard B,2009-09-22 18:49:00,735,Last time I went it was $100 off the weekly price. I don't remember if it was for all occupants of the boat or just the owner.

TWe also have a couple of older guys, so the full lodge deal works best for us. TThis puts us around the WaWa, Chapleau, Sudbury, French River areas. Any suggestions?"
1135810,doubleheader,2009-09-14 13:02:00,2652,Check out Memquisit Lodge on the west arm of Nipissing. We're moving to Memquisit from our historical spot starting next year. Excellent bass musky and walleye water within minutes of the dock and lodge owners impressed us enough to jump ship.
1135905,SkeeterJeff,2009-09-14 19:07:00,31,"We have been going to Garden Island Lodge on Lady Evelyn Lake for six years, and are booked for year 7 in 2010. We drive up from Indianapolis, but overnight with family in SE. Michigan, then drive in the next day. You are about 700 miles from there, but mostly interstate. It's a great camp with a great owner, awesome fishing (Walleye, Small Mouth, Northern), has a full American plan, and is reasonably priced. Check out their web site at garden-island.com. Jeff"
1136352,Kruger,2009-09-16 15:08:00,259,Pineportage lodge is a fly in out of Wawa. I have been there 6 times and will be going back. Plenty of walleye between 15-26. We always get at least a couple pike around 40. The lodge food and people are great.
1136389,Richard B,2009-09-16 18:15:00,735,"My bothers, their and my sons and daughters, and some of our friends have gone to Brennan Harbor. It is located on the Spanish River. The Spanish River flows directly into Lake Huron. During the week of the 4th of July 2008, the walleye fishing was fantastic, pike was good, and smallmouth was only fair, (the smallmouth had just completed the spawn). The cabins are nice and the food was very good. http://www.brennanharbour.com/ I live just south of Toledo and can make it to Spanish in approximately 10 hours."
1136799,eyefishermandt,2009-09-18 16:27:00,9,"gotta agree with richard b. have been to brennan harbour 15 times in the last 12 years, yes i go a couple times in the same yrs. anyways the fishing is fantastic, walleye are so easy to come by right off the dock, and the pike fishing is excellent also. we do mostly pike fishing and we also catch a ton of walleye just fishing for pike. most of these walleye range from 18-26"" but there are bigger ones that you will catch. we go the first week of june and easily end up with 500 fish for the week between the three of us and that is not a joke, but we do fish all day. so i would consider looking into this place and as a bonus i am on the website and the brochure with some of the fish i have caught. if you need any info just ask, and if you call to talk to james or casey tell them you know D.T. WITMER, just might get you in good. the prices are fantastic and the people are even better, great quality boats, as i suggest a 17' upgrade you will pay a little more but well worth it trust me. and like i said if its walleye you are after please consider this place. just for fun this last june we took a day to fish for walleye, and that was our plan fish them all day and leave the pike alone, well that did not happen as it was too easy we caught eye after eye right in front of the lodge, did manage to fish for eyes for about three hours and that was enough for then so we went for pike. and you will not be dissapointed i gaurantee it. so if you have any questions just get ahold of me and i can answer them. good luck on your quest EYEFISHERMAN D.T. (DONALD WITMER)"
1137120,Mikep007,2009-09-20 17:25:00,77,"I appreciate all the effort here folks, thank you. Brennan Harbor does indeed look like a great spot. We're used to a little more remote (no golf courses lol) but do have to consider two older gentlemen (72 years young!) in our party. Brennan sent us emails of guests to contact for references. We're looking for June and have plenty of time so keep any ideas coming...thanks much! DT, thanks for the email as well -- very kind of you!"
1137264,eyefishermandt,2009-09-21 13:55:00,9,"No problem mike like i said if you have any questions you may get ahold of me also. I have a trip planned for the first week of june for the rest of my life, and im not kiddin. Heck maybe i might see ya there. The fishing is awesome. I have tallied over 15 pike that are over 40"" usually one a trip at least. So like i said if you have any questions just ask i will try to help out any way i can, eyefisherman d.t."
1137368,dibling,2009-09-21 19:13:00,53,Quick question. At the B. Harbor place can you bring your own boat? Thanks Mike
1137613,eyefishermandt,2009-09-22 18:09:00,9,"yes you can and i do think it might be cheaper to take your own, but i am not seeing that info on there page. alot of people take their own boats to the harbour, even though they have wonderful boats to use especially the upgrades. they are in fantastic condition and run well. hope this helps uot if not give them a call here is the site www.brennanharbour.com. they will be happy to assist you with any questions you might have, and also james makes the best smoked fish i have ever eaten it is delicious yummy, EYEFISHERMAN D.T."
