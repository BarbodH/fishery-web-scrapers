Accomodations were fantastic and the people at the resort were great! Fishing was great, I caught a MA Smallmouth, and caught many nice walleyes. I'd love to bring my boys up but feel that the cost at the lodge would be pretty steep to have five of us there. If I remember it was around $60 - $80 per night per person. We fish all day and all we really did was sleep at the cabin. There was a camp ground close by and I was wondering if this is a Provincial site or owned by Jackson's. I suppose I could call Jackson's to see what the scoop is but am curious if anyone has stayed there. Has anyone stayed there? If so, how is Mid-June through Mid-July? Bugs bad? Any insight would be appreciated. I think a camping experience for 2 nights with 3 good full days of fishing would be fun. Thanks in advance!"

They are primitive sites with just a fire pit but I have paid for hot showers at the lodge to clean up. The fishing is very good all summer long but bring lots of mosquito repellant after mid june. Call Jackson's for details on costs,etc."
