Does anyone know of any businesses in that area that offer that service? They could pick usup at our resort, or of course we could drive to their airbase, assuming it's not too far.Also wondering for those of you that have done this in the past, what did it cost per person?ThanksTerwalleye"

1137577,Weby13,2009-09-22 15:31:00,57,We stay on Lac Seul every year. Last year we did a 1 day fly in to Rainfall Lk. through Excellent Adventures in Ear falls(10 minute ride from Perrault Falls). We fished 11 hours there. Endless walleyes from 18 to 22 inches. My dad had 3 northern over 40 inches and my brother missed one over 40. They wanted $180 a man for the day but we talked and ended up paying $160 a man. We also have been to Twain Lk. and Zinzania Lk. through Gawleys in Ear Falls. He only gives you 7-8 hours of fishing. Both lakes have great walleye fishing 16 to 22 inches! There is decent Northern fishing in both lakes. He charged us $180 a man in 2005 and 2006.
