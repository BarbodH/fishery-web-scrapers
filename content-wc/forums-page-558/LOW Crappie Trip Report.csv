Fishing was generally the poorest I have seen it in many years of fall fishing the area. The factor I feel that contributed most for the less then sterling catching was the water temperature. When we arrived the day water temp was 72 degrees. When we left a week later, the day water temp was 71. For most days, the weather was hot - 70's/80's. Normally, I would expect the water temp to have been around 59 degrees. As a result, the crappies haven't moved much into their wintering deep holes. ""Fishing memories"" resulted in very few fish in the Hay Island vicinity. On Tuesday, we traveled back into Obabikon Lake and after searching the deep water(again ""fishing memories""), we had pretty good luck in a bit shallower water 8- 16 ft, left the lake while they were still biting after 4 hours with 57 nice ones to 13-1/2 inches. Tried shallower Wed. in Sabaskong, but just didn't connect. Back 25 miles to Obabikon, again did OK. The last day, we did manage to find them shallower in the shade in Stevens, took some nice ones 12- 13 inches. If I were going for crappies this year, I'd wait another 2 weeks to let that water cool down. The short time we spent fishing walleyes was generally a repeat of the crappies report. Usually the walleyes come for us during the crappie fishing, so we don't have to pattern for them. If anyone is interested in some pictures, email me. All things said, there is no other place I'd rather be. All trips to the area for me are great, back again next year! Bill Krejca"

I had to laugh, a friend of mine that usually goes with us but didn't. He asked if I wanted to go back up the 1st or 2nd week in october. I told him it wasn't that I didn't want to go, just no more vacation time. Wish I could make that trip every month or so. One of these years we will get together up there on the same week and do some crappie fishing together.Take care, Brett"
