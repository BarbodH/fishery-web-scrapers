1139138,bluefin85,2009-09-29 14:22:00,31,I am going there this March for the first time ice fishing. One of my friends parents bought a house there and we can stay in the house. From what i know the lakes are real good to fish. I hope I here some reports from this area. Would like to try it in summer also.
