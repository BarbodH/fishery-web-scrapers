1138073,skap,2009-09-24 10:47:00,58,Just came back from a quick trip to Minnitaki yesterday. Fishing was very good this year. Lots of fish slot and above. The weather has been consistent as well the last couple of weeks which I feel probably helps. Also had a good wind to break up the sun during the day. I will say though that Minnitaki is definitely a good morning and late afternoon lake. Things slowed down quite a bit from 12-3 in the afternoon. I have been going up there for the last 10 plus years and the fishing was a good as I have seen it. Let me know if you have any specific questions.

Had a hard time finding weeds beds for northern's through out the whole lake system, must be due to the cool summer and the lake being higher than normal, but when we found them the red spoon was the choice lure hands down."

Best 3 days in a row of weather, shorts and t's the first two days. Walleyes were anywhere from 7 fow-30 fow with our most consistent bite at 15 fow. Points, points, points. Biggest was 25"". Dropped a couple of big pike and caught some respectable smallies. Life is good...no...great. Can't wait for our Spring trip here in 2010."
