1139767,Steve of Madison,2009-10-02 12:54:00,230,"Your story really is funny. We were fishing in Boad and Sunlight a couple of years ago, 2 boats in our group when we find a small hump mid lake quite by accident. We threw out a bouy and started fishing. Within 5 minutes of setting that bouy, a boat with MN tags comes screaming across from the other side of the lake. Now....we thought we were the only boats up there until this guy shows up. Not only does he snake our spot, but gets the bouy's line wraped in his prop, while he is backtrolling from his console steering wheel. When we pointed out that the banging noise he was hearing was the bouy against his prop, only then did he even acknowledge that we were there. Long story short, we cut the line and left him to untangle the mess he created on his prop. We probably should have made sure he was still able to motor, but ........ Back at camp, we told the story to the other guys, best response ""must have been from Leech Lake"" From that trip on I always have a ""bait bouy"" just to see what we can decoy in."
1139887,Backwater Eddy,2009-10-03 04:39:00,3871,I know a certain clever codger who used a Duck Decoy rigged with a marker under it..actually I think it was a Coot Decoy..anyhow...he used it to ward off interlopers.
1139900,rebs,2009-10-03 07:01:00,7587,"some of these stories are actually quite funny LMAO. I am sure to some they were not so funny at the time but, we have to remember fishing is a relaxing hobby and we need to laugh at things like this and not get angry and get our blood pressure up. Some guys catch fish all the time and some guys need a little guidance and help. The vast majority of these guys that crowd you and fish close to you are just trying to catch a fish and when they see you catching fish they just naturally want to fish where you are because you are catching and they are not catching. Strike up a conversation with them and you might be surprised how many new friends you will make, especially if you share what you are doing and what you are using. On the other hand if the crowd-er happens to be an arrogant sob, then just move away from him and don't allow him to ruin your time on the water."
1140332,Guest,2009-10-06 00:28:00,0,"Steve, I'll be up on Lac Suel this next week, would it be too much to ask where that mid lake hump is at on Sunlight? If so that's cool, and will understand."
1140433,Steve of Madison,2009-10-06 13:00:00,230,"My suggestion would be not to bother with Sunlight, you will do much better concentrating on the mid-lake humps off Manitoba Pt and the small islands down toward Stoney and Windigo Pts. That is unless some of the others viewing this have a better idea.send me a private mess and I'll pull out my maps."
1140478,Guest,2009-10-06 16:14:00,0,"Steve, how does a guest send a private message?"
1140687,rpieske,2009-10-07 13:09:00,1276,By registering.........
1140747,Steve of Madison,2009-10-07 17:55:00,230,"And then you get to make up a name for yourself, be clever, unlike me! Can I get mine changed.......please!!!!"
1139056,johnboat,2009-09-29 07:40:00,2014,"Jeeze gentlemen, mellow out. I'll bet most of the time you are making a mountian out of a mole hill on this ""don't fish near me"" topic. Do people get to close sometimes? Maybe. But. let it go. Keep fishing and enjoying yourself. (Unless you are on your own private lake that you happen to own) If not, deal with it. Here's an idea, throw your ego overboard and visit with them. They might be nice folks. I have been surrounded by boats myself and it does not seem to bother me as much as it does some. I have had a guy snag my bouy, but to me that is kind of comedy relief and something to talk about once back at camp when the whiskey is flowing. You think its bad on the water try sitting in a tree stand and some boob sets up a tree stand right at sunrise about 60 yards away. There is nothing you can do. The boobs will always be around, it's how we deal with them that matters. BTW I have bite marks all over my tonge. John B.O.A.T."
1139086,Dacotah Eye,2009-09-29 11:05:00,2722,"I had problems with boats gathering around my marker while fishing Lake Oahe one afternoon. I dropped the marker to mark a tree while I was trolling crankbaits so I could avoid the tree. Boats were backtrolling around my marker and losing lots of tackle. They absolutely wouldn't leave, so I pulled the marker. I moved down a ways from the tree, tied two yellow balloons together with mono and left 18"" for a dropper to which I tied a bell sinker. It was really comical watching these boats backtrolling around this marker in 80' of water until they caught on to what I had done."
1139092,Steve of Madison,2009-09-29 11:20:00,230,See.....boat decoying can be alot of fun!
1139093,walley250,2009-09-29 11:34:00,161,Thats awesome Dacotah.
1139322,2746,2009-09-30 09:19:00,3206,"Good response and your right, most of these folks are nice if you just start up a conversation with them. We've met a lot of new people and even made new friends doing that on our Canada trips."
1139514,Obabikon,2009-10-01 08:37:00,2370,"While I agree that it's not an issue to be made a HUGE deal out of. I dont' think many posting on here were. I'm a big fan of courtesy... from tipping, to holding doors for ladies, to traffic, to fishing... it's an art that a lot of people don't use. I also don't think it should just be forgotten because a lot of people don't use it. While ignorace is bliss... it doesn't justify rudeness. But, being rude back doesn't help... informing does. That said, ""Two wrongs don't make a right... but three lefts do!"""
1139519,Backwater Eddy,2009-10-01 08:54:00,3871,I was anchored on a large river flat....nothing to special about it...I just picked a spot and set up to vertical jig.A boat was 100 yards upstream from me...and I started to catch fish....a few minutes went by I looked over my sholder and it was now about 40 yards away...no big deal....went back to fishing...caught a few more fish.....looked back up stream...now he is anchored 20 yards away....Hummmmm....a creaper Eh.OK....back to fishing I go.....caught a few more fish.....THUMP.....look back...here his boat was right up against mine now..and he dropped anchore so the water splashs on my bow...HUH.....OK....as his boat rubs up against mine as he starts to jig next to me.All righty....I sat there a few minutes..caught a fish...looked over to him...and asked him if he just wanted to hop on in and see if his luck improves.He called me a smart A$$...I didn't respond.... and pulled up and left.Ya....some folks take the cake..Eh.
1139558,rpieske,2009-10-01 12:35:00,1276,"Great story, Backwater Eddie. I'm always amazed that some folks just don't have any sense of humor. That was funny. The more rude they are....the more easily offended they are. I have absolutely zero tolerance of rudeness. I never let it pass without comment. I love life and I love people. But I just can't abide a bully or a rude person. You get a lot more accomplished with a sense of humor than anger....most of the time."
1139580,Steve of Madison,2009-10-01 14:30:00,230,Eddie.....I wonder if he thought you were encroaching on HIS spot. Not that I believe you were.
1139619,Backwater Eddy,2009-10-01 19:12:00,3871,"It don't really matter but I was out long before he showed up, and I really didn't care if he was in the area or if he even got closer...but..that was a bit too close for comfort in my opinion. Once he actually pulled up aside me with his boat resting against mine and started looking into my boat, well....it's not like he was bringing me lunch or some hot coffee. Coffee would have been nice...mine was cold by then."
1136867,81Saluki,2009-09-19 06:49:00,97,"Steve -- In our neck of the woods, empty bleach and motor oil bottles are routinely used to mark submerged hazards, so that won't work for us. But ... LOVE the concept! I'll have to make a couple of cheap ""decoy markers"" this winter to try the misdirection next year."
1136916,Terwalleye,2009-09-19 12:18:00,166,"Wall-i-lama.....Love the shirt!!!Living in SE Wisoconsin, I am happy if it is just a fishing boat within 100 ft of me. 'round here it's usually some jacklag pullin a wakeboarder and thinks anchored fishing boats make for good slolem bouys.One thing I have learned about inconsiderate people. THEY DON""T GET IT. I have tried to educate politely. If you try to communicate it to them, then you are just the ""jerk"" (in their mind) on the lake today that told them something they disagree with. Case in point the dufus that thinks because he is 270 and 6'5"", that you should just shut up becasue he is bigger than you. How ironic he starts his post with ""Grow up."" lol Can't wait to fish CA next summer and not be a buoy!!"
1136987,Steve of Madison,2009-09-19 20:34:00,230,"Dodgeman.....I agree with you completely. When I place a ""decoy"" it is usually in a place where nobody with a ""clue"" would stop to fish, that's what makes it so comical. If a guy is following me around or chasing other guys markers they deserve the bluff. Back at camp our group is always helping out any new groups, particularly if they are first timers, and I've even had boats stop by during shorelunch to ask questions, and we are always willing to share info. It's those guys that will pull in and sit on the markers that entice me to not play nice."
1137361,Wall-i-Lama,2009-09-21 18:51:00,1524,"TerWalleye, Thanks. I got the shirt a few years back. The only problem is that this old shirt is paper thin and has been sewed up a lot. I wish I could find a new shirt like this one.I used to fish in SE Wisconson and can relate to what you are saying. The last few years I was there, we did a lot of night fishing just to get away from the day traffic.Where are you fishing in Canada? We fish LOTW out of Sioux Narrows and have a blast.Take care"
1137423,Terwalleye,2009-09-22 00:45:00,166,"Going to fish Cedar Lake, south of Perrault Falls. There is some great fishing in SE Wi; but the bouy factor can be a bit much."
1137521,Dacotah Eye,2009-09-22 11:04:00,2722,It must make a difference where you go in Canada. I just returned from there and saw two other boats on the lake where I stayed and when we went to another lake we saw only one other boat and it launched after we pulled ours out. It was a great week of fishing.

A guy comes from upstream on the east side, shoots 150yd past me, cuts in to my trolling path, drops his electric and starts casting. Right in front of me!?!?!I was irritated to say the least. A good bite took the sting out of his extreme lack of manners.~EA"
1137740,Glenman12,2009-09-23 07:57:00,762,Thats pretty much the scenario I had in my post on this subect..I hate when people do that..but it happens once or twice a trip
1139024,way2goofy,2009-09-28 22:52:00,22,"I don't want to get any guides mad that might be on here but I've had guide boats blow by me very close, wide open. It might be different if you're on big water, but if you are in a narrow channel and they go screaming by it almost knocks you out of the boat. I know they have paying clients with them that expect to catch fish but do you throw courtesy out the window? In the next breath I had guide go out of his way to help. My brother-inlaw was having motor trouble and I was towing him back to camp. A storm was brewing bigtime to the west and we were going to get wet. A guide with no clients onboard pulled up and said he would tow for me as he could tow the BIL's boat faster. He got the boat to camp and I gave him $20 for his trouble. I don't mind another boat getting close if they are fishing as long as I don't have to throw the fenders out! The narrow channel is in Blueberry Inlet on LOTW and the helpful guide was a Totem Lodge Guide."
1135460,Golden Eagle,2009-09-12 14:12:00,2642,"October 3, I'll be arriving at a flyin lake just north of Red Lake. I'll probably be the only fisherman in camp and would like to have one other boat on the water so we could look after each other in case of a breakdown. I've done this trip alone several times with no problems, but........................I usually take extra food along each day and may take my sleeping bag in the boat this year. Or if I run into trouble on the water I'll fish with two rods and fishcop Don Maw, will find me within minutes."
1135462,Moondog,2009-09-12 14:43:00,362,"If you are going alone, you may want to up the anti on the Maw bait some!!!! I hear that Donny has been terrorizing visitors on Gull Rock the past few weeks, going with them back to camp and checking their underwear for fish."
1135464,Golden Eagle,2009-09-12 14:52:00,2642,"I met Donny when he checked us on the way home in May. Introduced himself as Don Maw, which accounts for me not calling him by the more used ""Donny"". I'll be super clean. Donny is one hard working fishcop. He loves his job. He's hitting Gull Rock because his flying budget took a hit."
1135521,Moondog,2009-09-12 22:49:00,362,"I will say that when he ""boarded"" us in June that he was very professional, non-smiling, all business and we had nothing to hide. He did treat some people who stayed at our camp with great disdain and was extremely disrespectful even in light of the fact that they were clean. Good fishing and be safe!!!"
1135548,Glenman12,2009-09-13 07:48:00,762,"My pet peeve is when we are obviously trolling a shoreline, concentrating on an area about 50yds long..we pick up fish, turn around to troll it again and another boat just slides in and anchors in front of us..yeah, I know there are other spots.."
1135559,Obabikon,2009-09-13 09:27:00,2370,"I honestly think there's a logical set of rules 1.) Don't EVER let someone you don't know ruin your fishing trip 2.) Apply the ""Golden Rule"" whenever possible 3.) Don't be afraid to fish multiple spots for seclusion... seclusion is your responsibility if you want it. 4.) Don't always let someone get away with rude fishing, they have to be informed somehow 5.) Never stoop to a lowlife's level... Some situations need pointed out. Especially if you're going to leave anyways. If someone anchors in front of you trolling the boat. Just tell them... ""hey, we're going to leave, but you really shouldn't anchor in front of someone trolling a shoreline, it's not polite"". They'll either say ""sorry"" or ""Fv$k off""... either way, you're moving on, and don't care. If they're not lowlife's, and said ""sorry""... then they'll probably know that for next time."
1135804,Steve of Madison,2009-09-14 12:29:00,230,"Or you can always throw out a highly visible painted bleach bottle and ""plant it"", so those guys who like to move in on someone elses markers can accomodate themselves, while I fish the spot I want. It is amazing how well they work! Had taker's come in from all over this past trip, high was 4 boats at one time. I get really interesting looks when I come in and pick it up."
1135805,Golden Eagle,2009-09-14 12:37:00,2642,Thanks for the idea Steve. I'll try that one.
1135891,Steve of Madison,2009-09-14 18:24:00,230,"It's become a conversation starter and a contest for our group, to see who can get the largest number of other boats, and get them to start fishing in the most unusual spots. I got 4 boats to hit the ""bait"" in South Bay on LS this past summer. I admit, it was easier to catch the boats than fish that day, but it did make up for the lack of action on the end of my fishing line. LOL"
1136850,dodgeman29,2009-09-18 23:08:00,11,"There are two ways of looking at this so I guess you have to figure out which way to take it.- Either the people who moved in on you are lazy and don't want to take the time to find their own fish or they have absolutely no clue as to where to find them and how to catch them. After this happens to you a few hundred times you tell which it is right away. I feel sorry for the people that don't have a clue. I'll give them a little advice if asked as I'm pulling up anchor and moving, especially if they have kids with them. The lazy guys do irk me quite a bit. I could go on and on why but to put it simple - do your own searching and find your own fish like I do. There's a reason why I'm fishing away from the crowds. Unfortunately, it does seem like it's more the norm for someone to move in anymore, especially if they see you catch fish than it is for them to leave you alone and find their own."
1134799,Tony Shirley,2009-09-09 11:38:00,211,Ranger has that slogan lol Build one boat at a time
1135238,Guest,2009-09-11 07:14:00,0,Maybe this has been asked before but how close can I get to to on your spot before I'm too close?
1135254,Flip Silverlake,2009-09-11 08:28:00,645,"When you have to wait till he leaves to get your marker! I had that happen on LOTW last year. This year the sporting thing was the wake boats pulling very large people would see how close they could get to you so you would have a good look at them. I do remember an evening, fishing a hump, near Kippling island where a boat with 4 folks nearly ran into us. Now I did get their attention when I pitched a plug at them which hit the stern of their boat."
1135260,Wall-i-Lama,2009-09-11 09:03:00,1524,Here's how you can tell you are fishing too close to another boat. https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...pictureid=2906
1135261,bob oh,2009-09-11 09:09:00,3936,"I guess we get immune to it in the Western end of Erie - it's almost always a bit crowded (well not so much the last 2 years with layoffs, prices etc.) Even if you're fishing the fringe someone will see you net fish and a group forms. Don't mind it as long as they give me some space to fish. If I'm perch fishing I love lots of company, the more bait in the water the more the perch will hang around :-) Biggest problem on Erie is when you're trolling and it gets crowded and people are going everywhere and you're not sure which way to steer :-) Went on fly ins for years and can't remember any boats except our own group. I guess if you're fishing shallow water it would be a problem but a lot of times I fish on Erie reefs with what looks like hundreds of boats LOL I agree with Obabikon, on plain makes a lot less wave than someone pushing past a half throttle. We also get the big pleasure boats and go fast guys who like to blast through the ""pack"". For some reason that is funny to non-fishermen."
1135278,Bill Krejca,2009-09-11 10:54:00,6107,Huh? What does it say? Bill Krejca
1135305,freespoolin,2009-09-11 12:51:00,472,"I have a problem with guys who want to anchor over the spot and I want to troll. But then, I don't own the spot and maybe the other guy has been fishing ""his spot"" for 20 years. With modern maps, sonar and GPS there are no secret spots. The secrets of the past are now community spots. If it gets too crowded or my partner gets too chatty, I move. Fish can always been found in other spots."
1135333,Flip Silverlake,2009-09-11 15:52:00,645,I agree with your position but when a guy moves in so close you can't get your marker thats pushing it a bit. Your right if a spot has a couple of boats or you can't fish without causing a problem there are plenty of other spots to go to.
1135398,JAY221,2009-09-11 21:27:00,877,"If I can cast into your boat you have moved in to close! Just an opinion. Later, Jay"
1135409,archer66,2009-09-12 02:54:00,21,"I live in Missouri and fish a local 56000 acre lake. During the crappie spawn and during the summer pattern crappie bite there are boats everywhere. When I go to a spot that I know to be productive and find someone else there, I move on. Every time. I will never pull up next to another boat to fish. However I have had guys actually pull up and tie to the tree right next to me, virtually fishing the same cover. When that happens I'll visit for a few minutes then pack up and leave. I accept that MTL is a busy lake and deal with it. When I go to Lac Seul, one of the things I expect is relative solitude. When I was a kid in the 70's and 80's you see no other boats except those at the lodge. Now its different. We saw boats everwhere we went this year. Don't get me wrong it wasn't like MTL at home but there were NUMEROUS times over the course of the week that I was headed to a spot only to find someone else already there, in which case went elsewhere. Not everyone was so curteous. I spend all of my time trolling and generally will pick a reef, shoreline, or Island and systematically work the area. I had boats pull in on me several times over the week and in each case they should have been able to tell that I was trolling and should have been able to tell that they were pulling up in an area that I was fishing. I'm not talking about 100 yards away..I'm talking about 100 feet away which to me with all that water around is too close. I wouldn't do it and would appreciate it if it didn't happen to me. Did I let it ruin my trip. No, but I quickly packed up and moved elsewhere. So, I suppose you can categorize me as a grumpy bast.....One thing though...I do have the power to change it...I'll be finding somewhere else to fish next year."
1134001,jokerjim,2009-09-05 11:25:00,473,The problem with guys crowding in on you isn't only limited to fishing out of a boat. How many times have you been sitting alone on a pier or bank fishing and someone comes up and sits almost on top of you. If you happened to catch a fish the next thing you know they are casting over your line. Also goes for parkimg away out in a parking lot so you car will not be dinged up and when you come out of the store some clown has parked right next to you !!!!!!
1134012,rebs,2009-09-05 12:14:00,7587,"I hear ya on the parking and it is usually a clunker..........rusted, dings etc. On the other hand it bugs me when someone parks crooked and takes up two parking spots so no one gets close to them. also I seen a guy park in a handicapped spot crooked and took up two spots, then got out and jogged into walmart, was he mentally handicapped because he sure wasn't physically handicapped. Then you get the young ones that have momma or daddy's car and use their handicapped sign to park in a handicapped spot"
1134015,v-bay gord,2009-09-05 12:34:00,3168,"Re-reading my post and the other postings, I have come to the conclusion that I am an old bast*rd. On reflection, for the most part when I have had ""difficulties"" with other anglers crowding into me it has been because....A) they just don't have a clue that it might be irritating to others.......or B) I just didn't consider that they may have been in this spot the day before. It seems in my experience there have been very few who have been knowingly and blatantly the rotten s.o.b's I might have thought them to have been. I'll see if I can follow the lead of Rebs or Saluki and make an attempt at instilling some fishing etiquette one boat at a time. (without ruining my day!)"
1134061,orchard frank,2009-09-05 19:26:00,1900,"My wife and I went to Lac Seul for 2-3 weeks a year for about 14 years or so. The whole trip became much more important than just the fishing, but we always caught a million anyway. If we were on a reef with a good bite, I would be the nut waving to someone in the distance to come on over. Then maybe invite them to share shore lunch with us. We had a great set-up with a stove, folding chairs, roll-up table, etc. and I can throw a mean meal together. Met some great folks. Sometimes people are new to a fishery, and it can be overwhelming, may need a little help. If someone seems to be too aggressive or too much of an a-hole, I don't want to be around them anyway, I'm outta there. But, we had the advantage of knowing a bunch of other spots to go to, or went looking for new ones."
1134092,Guest,2009-09-06 05:20:00,0,"Orchard Frank Couldn't agree with you more. Have been visiting the Sunset Country for 25 years. The scenery, wildlife and solitude are what I treasure most. Catching fish is just a bonus. FYI -- I go to Canada to relax and get away from work -- the pressure, co-worker jerks, high-maintenance customers, etc, etc, etc. The last thing I want is to have my teeny tiny little space on the water invaded by some Chatty Kathy who is too lazy to find their own hole when there are plenty of other places available to fish. If I really wanted to fish with lots of other people, I could just go up the road a few miles from my house and save myself a lot of time and money. And IMO -- Just because someone fishes a spot and was successful the day before doesn't mean they own it. If they get beat to their favorite hole, they should move on to another one. (And get out of bed earlier the next day!) Like VBayGord, Rebs & Saluki, I'll do my best to help change things ... one boat at a time (I really like that phrase ... should be someone's slogan!)."
1134439,Esox Angler,2009-09-08 07:57:00,102,"Boys,I have to admit that for the most part courtesy is dead. When I go ""up north"" I go to a lake where my party is the only one on the lake. No problems there. At home (Pennsylvania) is a different story. I just do my thing and really irritate the ""squatters"" by outcatching them and doing it with them fishing on top of me. I'm usually the first one on the spot and, of course, people pile up all around. I will complain a bit, though. I had shore fishermen show up after I had been on my spot for awhile and cast to my boat!!! Then they said there's enough water for me to go somewhere else b/c they were stuck to the access points on shore! EA"
1134740,rockape,2009-09-09 08:49:00,215,"What annoys me most is when someone buzzes by me at full throttle and hits me with a huge wake. Totally uncool. I fish out of the front of a 16 foot Lund with a butt seat. Twice this year, I had to jump down to the lower part of the boat so I wouldn't fall in the lake. Now that makes me mad. As far as being on a hole, I don't mind as long as the other boat or boats maintain a decent distance. I fish a river inlet that is a well known walleye hole with big pike in there too. If someone starts getting too close, I pull out the big pike gear and start making bomb casts with big baits around my boat. I'm not trying to hit their boat or anything, but that keeps them away when they see what I am doing. Lets my dad jig for walleyes in peace. It is all the more rewarding when you hook up with a big pike with them right there!"

The biggest wake a boat can mke is when it's not going fast enough to plain, and is pushing all that water in the rear. If you're going to slow down... then IDLE past! That's the courteous thing to do... otherwise, just don't slow down at all, because you're just making it tougher, and you're not being courteous anyways (why try?)."
1134786,rebs,2009-09-09 11:01:00,7587,"I was talking about the bigger pleasure boats and skiers, they leave a big wake even at full throttle and even worse if the are turning"
1134793,Obabikon,2009-09-09 11:22:00,2370,For sure! I guess I just don't ever see those on LOTW's.... I always think of fishing boats.
1133875,81Saluki,2009-09-04 14:41:00,97,"Just curious what people think about fishing manners on the water. In particular ... Let's say you're fishing somewhere and you find a nice hole. There's no one else around (zero other boats on the entire lake) until someone else decides to join you. It's not a friend/companion nor from the same camp. There are obviously plenty of other places to fish, but -- for whatever reason -- they decided to join you. This just happened to me. As they trolled by and started to chat, I casually mentioned how big the lake was. They obviously didn't get the message and they stayed around for a couple of hours. Does courtesy go out the window when getting on the water? When I see someone in my target hole, I regroup and choose another one. What do you do? Was I out of line? Just curious what y'all think."
1133883,Guest,2009-09-04 15:40:00,0,"I would say grow up. How old are you, 12? I can't even tell you how many times this happens to me in a year. I just deal with it, and if they bother me that much, I go somewhere else. You were talking about one boat, right? Maybe I could see your arguement if 10 boats came and sqeezed you out, but one? I had somebody say that to me last year and I was 50 yards from them!! They shut up once we got near each other and saw I was 270lbs and 6-5."
1133895,fireboat,2009-09-04 17:03:00,752,"Boats are like magnets, they attract each other. Maybe that guy didn't have a clue and was hoping you would give him some school."
1133896,Catman59,2009-09-04 17:12:00,345,"I can honestly say ........ its never happened to me in Canada. I guess thats why we go where we go. In 7 years I have probably seen 15 other boats total. 54000 acres of underfished Canadian waters !!!!! Now back here in Iowa ----- its a whole different story. Floatillas are what we call them around here , I get used to it and just fish away."
1133898,Bill Krejca,2009-09-04 17:35:00,6107,"I honestly feel it makes a difference depending on the situation. There are certain fish magnets, such as below a dam/falls/narrows where fish just naturally congregate. I feel in these kind of places it is normal to expect company. This does not mean your new found friend should be bouncing his bait off of your gunnel, but more tolerance for company is expected to be tolerated. Being in the middle of a huge bay, with no reefs nearby would be an example of less tolerance for meeting new friends. Fall crappie fishing, which is what I will be doing in several weeks, presents a whole new opportunity to meet new friends close up. It is normal for folks to criss-cross fairly close to each other as they follow the clouds of fish moving in the area. Most folks accept this as part of the nature of this type of fishing, and actually may get to know each other in a good way; confrontations are quite rare and unexpected. Bill Krejca"
1133913,Obabikon,2009-09-04 19:25:00,2370,"It depends on the size of the hole, and the fishing. Like bill said... it it's crappies, get used to it. If it's a popular spot, find less popular spots. Who knows, these guys may have been fishing that spot for 4 days, and killed there every day. They probably won't pass it up."
1133924,v-bay gord,2009-09-04 21:16:00,3168,"So I guess if you are oversized it is o.k. to move into an area where someone else is fishing? I would agree that there are some spots that you expect others to join in because they are popular. But for the most part I think fishing etiquette has fallen by the wayside. There should be some common courtesy shown......especially on more remote waters such as in Canada..........where the size of your boat, your beer belly, or your sudden friendship that you show to the person you ""move in on"" doesn't make up for the fact that you are too lazy to find another spot to fish. Just my opinion, but I might be a bit of an old bas#ard."
1133930,rockpt,2009-09-04 22:12:00,589,"I'm with Bill Krejca. Been fishing Canadian water for 20 years, over 40 trips total and taking my 22nd trip to LOTW in four weeks. The fall crappie holes are well known and a prime gathering spot. The walleye humps and fall current spots are also well known. I have no problem with a boat coming onto a spot I'm on as long as it's a big enough spot for two boats and they're not so close I can see what channel their VHF is tuned to. I've made a few good friends over the years by meeting guys on the water. Yes, there are some guys who are inconsiderate and push the limits. But if someone comes in, is polite and respectful, what's the harm in saying hello, discussing the fishing, where you're each from, etc.?Had to add this. Some of my best memories from our fall trips are going to Smokehouse or the Elbow on the first or second Saturday in Oct. and congregating with the other boats fishing for crappie. If it's good weather, might be 12-15 boats in the general area. Kind of a big party with everyone enjoying the fall weather and the fishing. Slowly troll around with your crappie rigs and chat with the other boats. If you're fishing in Canada and want to be alone, there's lot's of water."
1133976,81Saluki,2009-09-05 09:20:00,97,"Nice to hear that most of you believe people should be more courteous on the water. And I agree with those who said certain circumstances can justify close proximity and congestion. It's the situation (particularly when fishing for walleye) where the lake is big and few other boats are around that gets to me.Guess I will just continue to try to improve good etiquette on the water by the following:1) When I head into a hole and see someone else is already there, I'll pull up short, regroup, and head to another hole ... regardless of how congested the lake may be. There are *always* other places to fish. Hopefully they will see & remember what I did and do the same when in a similar situation.2) When established in a hole and someone pulls in along side me, I'll casually and politely mention how open the lake is (when that's the case; otherwise, I'll be happy to share).Perhaps if more of us do these things, we'll make fishing more enjoyable for everyone, one boater at a time -- especially for our children and grand-children who learn good etiquette from us. The teen-aged son of one of my fishing buddies got so frustrated one year that the next year he wore a t-shirt that said ""If you can read this shirt, you're fishing too close!"" How sad is that?"
1134000,rebs,2009-09-05 11:24:00,7587,"it really doesn't bother me, if I am catching a few fish and someone else is having a hard day I don't get upset if they get close to me. I am not a touring pro or anything like that and I fish for fun and enjoyment.what does tick me off is when another boat goes wizing past me leaving a wake that makes me hang on.Had this happen once on erie and the jerk did it twice, I watched them waited for them to stop and setup their rigs, then I blasted past him about 4 times with a huge wake. They shook their fists at me. Then I pulled up to talking distance from them and asked what the problem was, they are all poes and says I almost swamped them. I just replied in a normal voice and tone and said what do you think you did to me a few minutes ago ? They apologized and I apologized and now when we see each other on the lake we pull up and talk a bit and share information. Every altercation doesn't have to end in hard feelings, fists or guns.By the way there was 4 men in their boat and just my wife and I in ours. LOL"
