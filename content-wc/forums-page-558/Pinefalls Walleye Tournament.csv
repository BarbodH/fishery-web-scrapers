1135725,Guest,2009-09-14 07:44:00,0,Don't worry boat numbers will be there. I am taking phone calls and registrations daily. This tournament is 100 - 110% pay out. All expenses are paid in the form of corp. donations and this is done. Enough money has been raised for this years expenses and to start next year. ALL MONEY GOES BACK TO THE ANGLERS... BALANCE SHEETS FROM LAST YEAR WILL BE AVAILABLE AT THE RULES MEETING. My attitude about this tournament is run it to the best of our ability don't play games with pay outs and the rest will take care of itself. See you all this fall. entry forms www.papertowninn.ca
