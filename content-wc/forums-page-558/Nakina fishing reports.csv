On Saturday we had North winds of 30.400 mph with 2"" of snow and white caps on lake. One other day it rained so hard we gave up on fishing. Total fish caught was down. The eyes we caught we of a nice size, 18"" +. Largest pike was just over 40"" and was caught on the last day. Oh, did I mention the water was at least 3' above normal. Will be back to Nakina next year. Going to Melchett Lake."

1139074,Guest,2009-09-29 09:39:00,0,"Fished in Melchett about6 hrs.on sat took largest walleye there. Fished the river on Sat and Sun small pike very few walleye,blamed it on the water temp. the moose was a young cow 2 1/2 years or so.upper end of kap was basically barron of walleyes down to the islands till Thursday afternoon .several days of tuff fishing. AWO is a great place to book with they have big water lakes as well as smaller lakes.I have been going there for several years. Prior to that had been going with Nakina airservice from 1979 till they sold their lease's."
