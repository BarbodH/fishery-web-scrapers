1137829,81Saluki,2009-09-23 11:58:00,97,I just visited the aquavu.com web site and was VERY disappointed. Numerous products were listed as either 'out-of-stock' or 'unavailable' and other web features didn't work. Then tried calling the contact number for questions but was directed to 2 other numbers. The run-around continued. Good grief!! Does anyone know what the scoop is? Are they still in business? Or is something else going on?
