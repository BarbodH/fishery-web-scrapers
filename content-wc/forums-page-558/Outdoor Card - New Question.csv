Several folks are heading up with me in a couple of weeks, and for various reasons, can not find their slip that indicated they've already purchased an outdoor card. It looks like they have a couple of choices: 1) Do nothing and hope they are not asked. 2) Purchase another one. 3) Inquire immediately to the proper authorities, whoever/wherever that might be. I realize that #3 is the correct choice, but I would think the above is not a completely unusual happening. For one individual, a new licence will be purchased anyway; for another, his present license is still good. Does having a license constitute having gotten an outdoor card? Will the guy getting a new license be forced to get a new outdoor card? Can they purchase a new outdoor card without being required to purchase an accompanying license? Does anyone have any words of wisdom? Any readers in an ""authority capacity""? Thanks Bill Krejca"

Yes Can they purchase a new outdoor card without being required to purchase an accompanying license? Yes"
1132731,Planocat,2009-08-31 08:07:00,473,"""Does anyone have any words of wisdom?"" Tell your friends to get organized! LOL Going back to the same place? Perhaps the issuer has a copy. I would think a current license in hand for this year would be proof that the card was purchased. Maybe we'll have our permanent record by next year, but have yet to hear of anyone receiving the card. The person who needs a new license will probably have to spend the extra $9 if not returning to the same place it was originally purchased. Can't imagine not keeping the license and card together, but to each his own filing system."

1132784,v-bay gord,2009-08-31 11:38:00,3168,They can have a duplicate temporary outdoor card issued (the red piece of paper) at a Service Ontario desk (MNR building). This costs $9.75 due to an administation fee. You also need to go to a government office. The best option is to go to any licence issuer and buy another outdoor card for $9. They need to have the licence portion along with them. The preferred option is to not lose the piece of paper in the first place.
1132786,tackleman,2009-08-31 11:39:00,444,"when I bought mine on line, I could print off a paper copy of the licence and as long as I had an old licence to accompany it (didn't say how old )it was considered valid until a plastic card appeard in the mail."
1132808,Bill Krejca,2009-08-31 12:32:00,6107,"Thanks for the help, guys. One of the fellows going with me didn't think he was going again, disposed of the slip, and his 8 day licence a week before he determined he was going again, the other fellow didn't remember getting one this spring. It looks like the procedure will be to just get new ones at the bait store. Bill Krejca"

1137675,fishnut,2009-09-22 23:01:00,46,I lost my billfold after my 4th trip to Sioux Lookout. Included was my Ontario license and paper receipt for the outdoor card. I called before my next trip and was told to stop at the MNR office in Fort Francis which I did. I had to pay something less than $10 for a new license but did not have to apply for or pay for the outdoor card. I was told the cards would be sent out before the year end. Approximately 2 weeks later the permanent card arrived.
