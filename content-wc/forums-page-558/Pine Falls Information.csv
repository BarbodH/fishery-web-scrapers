We were on Traverse Bay Saturday Sept 26, drum, white bass, catfish, perch, sauger, 1 sturgeon and walleye. No big eyes, mostly ""eater"" size, mostly greenbacks."
1138882,KEEBOY,2009-09-28 13:29:00,61,"Thanks for checking around for a good map of the area I appreciate all the help and the report. Looks like the forecast is calling for some cooler days and nights. Maybe by Oct 10th when we get there, there will be some big ones in the rivers. Keep me posted on any large green back reports."
1138032,KEEBOY,2009-09-24 08:45:00,61,I was wondering if anyone can give me some information about the Pine Falls area. We are going to be in Selkirk Oct 9-12 and would like to fish that area as well. We have been going to the Red River for several years but have never been to Pine Falls. Can anyone give me some navigation tips for traveling in the river and in the bay of the lake. It sounds like there may be some areas to watch out for. Also any general fishing tips would be greatly appreciated. I will gladly post a fishing report when I return. Thanks for any information in advance.
1138074,freespoolin,2009-09-24 10:53:00,472,"Get a Pine Falls map. There's a rock at Treaty Point that with high water is just below the surface. And there's no marker buoys to show the route around that rock. You can stay to the North side of the river in this spot and be safe. So far, the greenback fishing has been more successful in the lake (Traverse Bay). Lots of fish in the 12""-18"" range but few big girls. The river has heavy flow and strong current this Fall which will make river fishing challenging. There are two tournaments scheduled, Oct 10-11 and October 17-18."
1138085,otis,2009-09-24 11:19:00,20,Anybody know of the current conditions on the Red. Heading up on the 12th of Oct to fish the Red and the Winnipeg. Missed out last year becouse of the high water.
1138092,freespoolin,2009-09-24 12:09:00,472,The south basin of Lake Winnipeg is yielding walleyes. The Red River has been slow so far. Check this website for local informationwww.manitobaanglers.com Freespoolin Black Pro Angler 16/Honda 75 stick
1138260,KEEBOY,2009-09-25 07:51:00,61,Thanks for the information freespoolin. Is there a local bait shop where I could get a lake and river map from that you could suggest?
1138298,freespoolin,2009-09-25 10:21:00,472,Clark's Corner in Pine Falls has bait but not sure about maps. Laurent Raymond owns the place and he's often on this site. You could pm him.
1138323,KEEBOY,2009-09-25 11:58:00,61,"Freespoolin, I am new to this site and find it very helpful but I can't figure out what ""pm"" means. Thanks for the help."
