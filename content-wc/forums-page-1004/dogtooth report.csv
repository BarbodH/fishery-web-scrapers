513817,Guest,2001-07-10 12:07:00,0,"Heading up to Dogtooth at the end of July. I have a map marked by some friends that go every year at that time. Any real spots that I should hit, since the map is marked scarce. Also, they said only fish with bare hook and split shot with jumbo leeches and crawlers. Is this the pattern? Would appreciate any help. Also, is there a mayfly hatch on the lake and if so when does it end?"
513818,Guest,2001-07-11 06:37:00,0,"was there June 22nd to 23rd. The fishing was brutal, all perfect walleye whether,chop, wind but no fish.There was about 15-20 boats there and on fri 18 wally's were caught. The hatch had just finished, maybe they were stuffed, but we didn't stick around to find out.We tried everything, cranks, bobbers, spinners, jigs, weeds reefs, shallow, deep, open water, slow,drift,and fast troll, caught nothing and I mean nothing.I was skunked and my partner caught a 3"" perch. Before we left we heard that dog turns off during early summer had to find out myself. I guess they were right.I consider myself an above average fisherman, and my buddy is good also. i believe we tried everything.Good Luck!...........I hope u don't need it.Post a report after and let me know how it went.I'd be very interested on how u didWALLYMARSSRIP SOME LIP!!"
513819,Guest,2001-07-14 05:38:00,0,WallymarssThanks for the report. I will let you know how we did.
513820,Guest,2001-07-30 06:28:00,0,"Fishing was actually really good. We had lots of 17-22 inch walleyes. However, when we caught three on a spot we left. We were going for the big one! We had a ton in the 24-26 inch range, alos a few 27's and 28's. The biggest was 29.5. By the way a lot of big fish were caught the week that we were there. One guy (Bob Reynolds) had at least 15 over 27 inches. Fishing was very good, just the big, big one got away."
513821,kevin,2001-07-30 07:40:00,74,Hey Al. Sounds like you had a great trip. What was the secret to your success? What type of structure were you fishing? Thanks for the help.
513822,Guest,2001-07-31 11:23:00,0,"we were fishing rock reefs. there is not mid lake ""classic structure"" like on a lake of mille lacs. fish the rocks and play wind on all spots. If there was no wind, there was no fish. great lake and remember to let them go. we only kept one 17 incher, cuz it was gut hooked. fishing with split shot rig and red or pink hooks"
513823,All Eyes,2001-07-31 15:09:00,43,"Hey Al, nice trip and good to hear you are a catch and releaser. Were you casting or trolling the rigs?"
513824,Guest,2001-08-02 04:58:00,0,"we were trolling the rigs. this was the best. we tried casting and reeling back , but to no avail."
