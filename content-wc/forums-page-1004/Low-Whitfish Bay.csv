514171,dlhomes,2001-07-30 12:09:00,62,I was just out there 7/20/21. Water has dropped approx. 1' is still high. Water is pretty clear approx. 7-10' as for colors???We only fished musky couple hours and had lots of northern/ smallie action. I've been told Long Bay/ Astron and Witch bays are the palces to be- is'nt that why I never see anyone in Whitefish except trout folks???
