512511,Guest,2001-05-31 16:51:00,0,Greetings fellow fishermen!I'll be in one of the small cabins just behind your campsite.Don't know which one but usually cabin #5 or 7. Be drivin a Toyota tundra on land and a Red Nitro on water.We'll get in around 10pm on 6/23 and leave 7/7How many of you are headed up? How long are you all staying?You bringing your own boats? How many times have you all been up there?Drop me an e-mail!I'm pumped...only 3 weeks to go!MP3553
512512,Guest,2001-06-04 03:26:00,0,Unless you work at the same place I do your email address isn't correct. Check mine out and see if it works. There will be 3 of us. I drive a white chev full size van on land and a red lund boat on the water. We have only been to Goosebay once and that was last year. We were on the SE end of Lac Seul 2 years ago and did not do as well. Drop me an email....
512521,Guest,2001-06-04 09:53:00,0,"Nate,We found larger walligators last July in South Inlet, which is the long narrow bay off of the southwest corner of South Bay. The lower half of the inlet has about a dozen islands - many with a steep enough dropoff so you can cast a jig into the shallows or troll a spinner rig. There also was an extensive flat reef in the middle of nowhere that held wallies and northern - I think it was in the lower 1/4 but I'm not sure. Saw a couple of boats working the 20' to 40' dropoff just east of the big island in the middle of the inlet. Something was keeping their interest as they were trollin back and forth all day.See you on the water, I'll be in a 16' green smokercraft."
512522,Guest,2001-06-17 13:56:00,0,"Couldn't take the pressure!!! Three of us are leaving 2 days early (June 20th). Instead of crossing the border at International Falls, we will drive straight north to Winnipeg, then east to Kenora. Anyone have info on fishing form there to Ear Falls? We will have Friday and Saturday for some extra fishing. Open to anything, and we will have our own boat.Any last minute fishing Lac Suel fishing reports?"
512523,Guest,2001-06-19 12:59:00,0,"Byron We are heading up July 10, staying at Onaway Lodge in Scout Bay. Please post an updated fishing report when you get back. Dept, jig colors, minnows vs leaches, water temp., location ect.I've fished most of the locations mentioned on this board.We go up about the same time each year and I would say Mckenzie Bay (the Big sand bank) is the most consistant producer of nice walleye. The little sand bank has been better a few times, but if the water is as high as they say it may have a lot of trees tops etc. making it harder to fish. Most years Broad and Sunlightare great, usually catch high #s but I have not caught any big ones up there.My best tip is to arrive early before most of the previous weeks guest have left and pick their brain. Most will help you out because the know they will not be fishing any more. Good Luck and Don't forget to post that fishing report when you return. Thanks"
512513,Guest,2001-07-29 15:50:00,0,Can you tell me how to get to this goose bay where you were camping. Is it a commercial campground or boat in? Thanks
512514,Guest,2001-07-30 17:23:00,0,Goosebay camp is a drive to camp. Approx 5 miles south of Ear Falls. Phone # 1-800-667-5208 or 807-222-3070Web site www.lacsuel.com >site was down tonight???
512505,Byron,2001-05-15 16:05:00,42,"Thanks for your reply. Man, this is one friendly & helpful board.I'm acctually going to be able to act like I know what I'm doing - with y'all's help.I will track down all the spots that have been mentioned, and one of the guy's that will be in my boat will have a GPS. We would certainly appreciate any coordinates you would be willing to supply.The offer I made to Nate about pond fishing was an honest offer and extends to you and Jigger. I love to fish and it dosen't take much of an excuse to go out for the day - week, whatever.What part of the country are you folks from?"
512506,Guest,2001-05-15 18:02:00,0,"Nate > you must of been fishing out the wrong side of the boat. Bouncers caught 98% of the fish! LOL. Go figure, the wife can be in the boat and I catch em and she gets squat! Guess she now knows how I feel most of the time! ROFL!Bouncers w/minnows are my goto rig. 24-36"" snell on 3/8-1/2 oz bouncer. Blade colors: orange, chartruse, chartruse/combo, red and gold in sizes 1-3 in Indiana or Colorado styles. Jigs work but take to long to locate fish. I use bouncers to locate the eyes. Sometimes the eyes are REAL shallow > inside weed line or in the weeds then I will pitch jigs at em. Jig colors like above and glow white.Wind is the key> fish the windy side of islands/points if all possible! Generally 6-15'is the depth of the fish that time of year. Could be shallower if minnows are spawing. If so, try the sandy shores and inside weed lines.GPS coordinatesBIG CLAY BANKS N 50 30.437 W 92 45.874SMALL CLAY BANKS N 50 32.042 W 92 44.526GHOST NARROWS N 50 28.121 W 92 46.752 ENTRANCE TO ALTIMETER CREEK N 50 25.380 W 92 44.203MANATOBA POINT N 50 24.670 W 92 46.394SHANTY NARROWS EAST N 50 28.861 W 92 53.451POPLAR NARROWS N 50 26.591 W 92 51.856NE of deer island a big island > fish NW point that faces Deer island.

512507,Guest,2001-05-15 18:26:00,0,"See MP this is where you got me into trouble. The 'eyes were stacked up in the weeds like you said, but those dang botttom bouncers grabbed hold of every leafy thing within 20 feet of either side of my boat. I made the switch to bullett weights and caught five or six fish per snag.When we ran out of minnows we hooked yellow twister tails to our spinners and never kept on hooking them--if I remember MP was slightly suprised about that one!I agree the spinner worked great to locate the fish. We used jigs when the bite slowed down. Same colors as spinners, I suggest fuzzy grubs and maribou, again with minnows.Byron, Be sure to ask a lot of questions from the folks at your camp. If they're not very helpful, I'd be surprised. Thanks for the OK Bass offer, it's going to be hard to go anywhere this summer with a new 2 week old baby and all.MP, I tried e-mailing you but my mail was returned. You must have changed providers. Drop me a note this week."
512517,Guest,2001-05-16 11:48:00,0,"Byron, We fished from Fisherman's Cove second week of July last year. Can't wait to get back. Like everybody is sayin, Broad lake can be hot. Two of us caught over 90 walleye and pike on one day by pulling spinners with minnows or crawlers. Orange and chartruse blades were consistent producers.Best spot was 200 yards either side of the the mouth of the river where you enter Broad lake in the northeast corner. It's almost an hours ride from Scout Bay. However, we found larger wallies in the 10'-15' reefs in south bay. Also had good results pitchin 1/4 oz. jigs to shore from 10 water."
512508,Guest,2001-05-16 15:57:00,0,"I've never ran out od minnows so ya got me on the twister tails!Have had many people tell me that plastic works but, haven't given it a shot. as for your weed problem, I will follow the countour of the weed line and stay just to the outside or inside of the weeds to avoid hangin them weeds. Remember one year the eyes being real shallow and pitching jigs w/minnows in 1-3' of water. Eyes were stacked up on the inside weed line feasting. We killed the eyes doing that! Seemed like everybody in camp was having troubles locating fish, that is until the cat was let out of the bag. This happened last year @ the end of my second week. Started out hot and heavy in 6-15' range and as the second week progressed started to catch less and less fish. By Wed/Thurs I had a real hard time locating many eyes. The last day tried everything... deep, jigs, cranks, worms etc. nothing was really working. Scratched my head and remembered an article in In-Fisherman stating when all else fails go shallower. Did that and presto hammered the eyes-inside weed line in 2-5' of water. So, for 2 1/2 days I'd been fishing in the wrong area. Wish I would of remembered that earlier and you can bet in the future I will!I've rambled enough > happy days to all!"
512518,Guest,2001-05-17 08:29:00,0,"Mr. Sauger,Which 10 - 15 reefs in South Bay are you talking about? We didn't spend a lot of time in South Bay, but the only place we found any ""agreeable"" fish was the NE entrance to Hungry Narrows. I have an Explorer map next to my computer, If you wouldn't mind, please be a little more specific. I fish out of Scout Lake Resort and hit pretty much the same water you do. Thanks in advance!"
512519,Guest,2001-05-18 06:55:00,0,"Nate,I'll need a couple of days to dig out my maps for South Bay details. Stay tuned...."
512520,Guest,2001-05-18 10:09:00,0,"I'm especially curious because I was at Scout Lake Resort the same dates you were at Fisherman's Cove. We probably crossed each other's wake. E-mail me the info when you find your maps, let compare notes. [email protected]"
512510,Guest,2001-05-30 18:23:00,0,MP35... I am going to be at Goosebay the week of June 23rd also. I will be the one camping in the tent with two other guys. We will be traveling up from Mo. We were there last year the during the last week of July and did very well. Hope to do better this year. We fished many of the places all of you have been talking about. Stop by and say Hi.
512509,Buznick,2001-05-31 02:29:00,7,NATE Try power leaches next time when you run out of minnows. Thatsmy go to bait on Lac Seul. I have been to my cottage and not even brought minnows. The fishing has been great on just power baits.Buznick
512497,Guest,2001-05-13 17:03:00,0,"West & East Shanty Narrows, McKenzie Bay & South Bay areas. Pike and Walleye. Any tips for late June fishing? I am from Oklahoma, and fish mainly farm ponds for large (5 to 10 lbs.) Black Bass. I don't know much about Pike & Walleye fishing, but am reading everything I can.Byron"
512498,Guest,2001-05-14 06:41:00,0,"Byron,I think you're going at a pretty good time. Last yearv we were there the first week in July and did pretty gfood, but from the sounds of it we should have been ther a couple weeks earlier. My suggestion would be to start with bottom bouncers and spinners tipped with minnows. Minnows caught 96% of our walleyes last year. We trolled weedlines and seemed to always find fish in 10 - 12 feet of water. For northerns, get some big (#5 or slightly larger) Mepps spinners and cast them into the outside edges of weedlines & hang on. Where are you staying? Which resort? We stayed very close to the areas you described above. We stayed at Scout Lake Resort last year and enjoyed it very much. Check out the Big and Little Sand Banks in McKenzie Bay and plan on taking a day trip up ltimeter Creek to Broad lake. You'll be glad you did!E-mail if you have any more questions."
512499,Guest,2001-05-14 11:59:00,0,"Thanks for your reply. We are a party of 9, and will be staying at Fisherman's Cove in Scout Bay (right around the corner from Scout Lake). I have fished from Fisherman's Cove in '97 & '98, and have enjoyed the fishing. On both trips I have just upsized the lures I generally use for bass and caught plenty of Pike up to 8 lbs. In '98, another guy and I got into a mess of Walleye, and caught 28 eye's between 5 & 8 lbs. in 2 1/2 hours. The only way I can describe it is ""Holy Cow!!! I want to do it again."" I must admit we got lucky. We had been drift fishing with leeches and happened to drift over the right spot.This time I really want to get serious about Pike and Walleye. Big & Little Sand Banks are not listed on the map I got on my last trip. Moose Island & Deer Island are. Also listed is Ghost Narrows at the far east end of Big Island. How do I find Big & Little S.B.? I will definitelly do Broad Lake. Thanks for your help."
512500,Guest,2001-05-14 12:51:00,0,"Yup, that's the same neck of the woods alright. Which map did you get? I have the Explorer Series for NW Lac Seul from lakemaps.com. Anyway, Big Sand Banks are just NE of Ghost Narrows. As you approach Ghost Narrows from the north, just before you get to the narrows, look to your left. You'll see a half-mile stretch of sand cliffs that drop into the water. Those are the Big Sand Banks. The Big Sand Banks are also recognizable by the 25 - 30 boats fishing them. Don't let that discourage you, there's usually plenty of fish for everyone.Broad Lake is awesome. Most people go there for the walleye and when they quit they go back to their cabin. But stay for the big pike. The walleye fishing on Broad is fantastic, the northern fishing is even better! Broad lake has a good beach on the south end for shorelunches.We didn't have much luck in South Bay, although we caught a couple of small walleyes on the east side of hungry narrows. The waterfall at the far end was neat, but not much for fish there.Personally I think Scout Lake is vastly underrated. We had some of our best walleye fishing along the weedlines of the small island on Scout Lake. Don't over look it. Let me know if you have any more questions.--Nate"
512501,Guest,2001-05-14 13:36:00,0,"Your map is much better than mine. At the bottom it says ""should not be used as a guide in navigation."" I'll try and get a map from the site you mentioned. I'm finding it harder to sleep. I keep thinking of Lac Suel. If you don't have anything better to do, and are in the Oklahoma area, I'll show you what farm ponds (over 40 ponds) for Black Bass are all about. My treat.Byron"
512502,Guest,2001-05-14 17:15:00,0,"Brian, I don't know that part of the lake as we fish the south central part of Lac Seul, but last year my daughter and I caught 6 walleyes over 8 pounds all on a jig(3/8oz - 1/2oz)& minnow combo. I'm kind of partial to jigs. We fished the last week of June and while the weather wasn't perfect the fishing was great! I'm going back with the guys and we arrive the day you leave.We fished pike in the afternoon on large spoons, no monsters in the boat, but man did we see some mammoth follows. 40+ inch variety. I'd like to get a photo with one of those hogs this year!Wish you the best of luck."
512515,Jigger1,2001-05-14 17:20:00,234,"Sorry Byron, realized I put Brian out there."
512503,Guest,2001-05-14 18:12:00,0,"Nate has some good advise!! You might try Ghost narrows > sand banks on SE side, the rock pile in the middle and the sw corner before you enter the narrows. Manatoba point and the point @ the entrance to Altimeter creek are also some spots to try. All are good walleye spots. Nate mentioned the Large sand banks in McKenzie. The small clay banks also are a good spot to check out. NNE of the large clay banks. I picked up a lot of eyes @ a rock reef SE of Shanty Narrows entrance > 100 yards from the east shore > rock pile came up to 2' of water. Fish were in 12'-18' of water.If you have a GPS I can send coordinates of the spots Nate and I were talking about. If you see a RED bassboat around, that will be me cause I'm headin up for 2 weeks 6/23-7/7 and stayin @ Goosebay. Hope to make it down that way but then again if gas prices keep going up, I'll be fishing from the dock! LOL!Hey Nate....ya ready to go up again???Keep your line tight and set the hook!"
512504,Guest,2001-05-14 18:24:00,0,"Byron, Listen to MP35! This man loaded me up with Lac Seul advice last year and he was about 97% accurate! (MP, you were off on the bottom bouncers and cranks, but other than that you nailed it!)Byron, the map I have is awesome. I'm familiar with the one you have, I think it's the one handed out by resorts for free. Or for $5 if you call them. This one is about $15 bucks but well worth every penny. It seems to be pretty good. We used it and a compass and never got lost once last year. It also came in gfood once we picked up on the type of structure fished worked best. We could go to the map and find several places. It was way more valuable than the $15 we spent.MP, I'm not going up this year. My wife and I had a baby just two weeks ago today. I'll be home with late night feedings while you guys will be up there! I'm going back next year for sure. I figure in about 10 years I'll be able to take my son. He already has a tackle box and a 20 gauge! Good luck all!"
512516,Byron,2001-05-15 08:47:00,42,"No problem Jigger 1. My Grandfather called me Barns until the day he died. If it's close, I'll answer.Nate, I ordered an explorer map of NW Lac Suel. Can't wait to get it so I can start plotting my stratigies."
