This reduction will have little effect on levels in the Pakwash area and from Ear Falls to Manitou Falls, but will help to lower levels along the Winnipeg River in Manitoba, with a delay of about two weeks. The level of Lac Seul is currently 356.75 m (1170.4 ft). The lake declined 7 cm (3 in) over the past week and is expected to decline 4-8 cm (2-3 in) over the next week."
