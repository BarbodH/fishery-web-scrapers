514149,BD,2001-07-28 10:55:00,739,Doc; Where in the Narrows are you going? I may be able to PINPOINT some great spots for you (in exchange for a few on the river :) ).
514150,Guest,2001-07-29 04:07:00,0,"BD, We are going on a houseboat from Floating Lodges. Will surely stop in Yellow Girl then go west maybe as far as Rope or Deadbroke, then possibly a stop for crappies in Blueberry on our return. As for tips on the river you may have me crossed with another Doc. Either way I'm not against any spots you can pinpoint. Thanks, Doc....Do they still have those bridge tickets?"
514151,GetTheNet,2001-07-29 06:04:00,29,"They are no longer tickets. It has been changed to a scan card. You can get them at Paulbeck's Super Value. Come into town, take a left at the McDonald's (17th). Follow to stop sign. Go straight through the stop sign and on to Hwy 11. At the stop light for Hwy 11 you will see Paulbeck's across the highway in front of you.Roger"
514152,Guest,2001-07-29 11:01:00,0,"What are these scan cards and how do they work, that you can use at the border crossing in International Falls? I have never heard of these."
514153,GetTheNet,2001-07-30 09:54:00,29,"Doc,I'm not certain I have all of the details correct but here gos. The cards are worth it if you use it up. I believe the cards are worth 10 round trips. It ends up being about half price. In the past they have also sold trailer tickets. Check on these when you by the vehicle pass. A boat trailer is $4 US without a ticket. The cards are transferrable and last one year. I'm not certain whether that is calendar or from the date of purchase. In a change from the past, you only pay on the way into Canada. No toll for the return. You must stop in town to buy the cards. They are not sold at the border.Anything else, let me know.Roger"
514154,dlhomes,2001-07-30 12:02:00,62,I bought a couple thinking they saved me $ome ca$h. They cost $10 and are good for I think 15 crossings and they expire June 30th. If you use them up in a year you save $5 yeah!!!! They did'nt have any trailer cards so you still pay $4 for your trailer. All in all they took away the big savings if you bought the books they had before. This is just the lube for the rest of the screwing you will recieve in Canada!! But I still love it and wish I could get up enough to use up my cards!!!!
514155,CJW,2001-07-31 12:43:00,167,We paid at the border going up to Canada and coming back it didn't cost a thing. Anyone else had that happen? Craig
514156,Guest,2001-08-01 15:28:00,0,"We made our first trip through Int. Falls this year. We paid going into Canada and nothing coming out. The people we were meeting said that it was both ways in the past. Hope I can get back in again next year, plans are already made."
514157,Guest,2001-08-01 18:55:00,0,"Yeah, the 10$ you pay going into canada is a round trip pass-you don't pay coming out. Think thats up slightly from previous years."
