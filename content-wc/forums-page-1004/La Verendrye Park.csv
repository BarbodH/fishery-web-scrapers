514050,mopar68runner,2001-07-23 18:06:00,1,Heading up to the Park this weekend with my two sons. I haven't been there in 30 years! We are looking to wilderness camp on smaller lake as we only have a 14' boat. Would like to catch walleye and northerns. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Pike go for the ""usual suspects"": Spoons, Mepps and topwaters. I was up there earlier this month and the northern eagerly swallowed Husky Jerks, speed trolled over deeper water. Hope you have good weather. We got lots of wind, lots of overcast and, as a bonus, snow on July 1st. The fishing, meanwhile, was terrific."
