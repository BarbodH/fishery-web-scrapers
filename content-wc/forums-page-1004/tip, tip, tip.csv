514061,Guest,2001-07-24 12:08:00,0,There should be a standard fee added to all services. Then the tips can be shared by everyone. Some restaurants do it already. I'm all for it. If you want to tip more that is your choice. I think 15% is a good place to start. I was a great cook and I did not see very many tips. The waiters cashed in on my extreme skills as a chef. I work at a call center now. I love my job phoning people at home and selling them financial services.
514062,Guest,2001-07-25 04:42:00,0,"How do you figure 15 percent? American plan resorts do not break down what is paid for boat, fuel, cottage, dock help, fish cleaning, meal serving, and cooking.Guide service is usually known, since it is an extra charge."
514063,Fred_G,2001-07-25 07:16:00,908,Our group puts $50 per man into a pot to split between all of the camp staff. Works easier than trying to figure out how much to tip each person. Fred
514064,Guest,2001-07-25 07:48:00,0,That's a mighty nice set of tips you got there.
514065,Fred_G,2001-07-25 10:27:00,908,"Fuzzy,Not sure what you mean. We feel that $50 per man is a very fair amount. We usually have 8 - 10 guys in our group and the camp staff has always gone well out of their way for us. If we had a year where we felt the service was sub par, I'm sure we would decrease that amount somewhat. However, that has never happened. Part of it is also leaving the staff with the desire to provide the same level of service next year. In the overall cost of the trip $50 amounts to less than 5%. Almost seems like too little to me.Fred"
514066,Guest,2001-07-25 12:00:00,0,Fred G - buddy 'read' between the lines - it's a pun - But your tips are like 80 bucks CN - I'm sure they appreciate it.Many Many people do not know about tipping up there.
514067,Guest,2001-07-26 16:08:00,0,Fuzzy... glad you be feeling so frisky!Good you are back in form. :-)
514068,Guest,2001-07-26 17:15:00,0,"Awe - TMac- just walked through an open door to make someone who reads it giggle a little. Moreover, I think Fred's crew tips very well, and my wife is always saying I tip too much! I think it is good to tip 'up there', but not too much. I mean unless the resort crew is really cranking for your group. They get paid well because the owners know they have good 'people skills' and help out. We just got back a week ago and our camp 'overseer' guy saidtips help with Christmas presents and this and that. He banks income on wages. But we dropped a hundy on him anyway. Heck - we are showin him new spots now. My bride got a 13 lber this trip and is so happy she kicked my butt. I out fish her 3 or 4 to 1 all week and it is all negated by one giant, healthy and realeased walleye. (Between you and me, I just let her raise the bar a little bit, OK?, don't tell anyone). I'll get her next year! It's strange on how they never ever compliment your boat control skills - ain't it? Or your ability to spot moose on distant shorelines for photos. Hmmm - OK I fell better now after venting. Oh no - I'm not envious one bit about that fish! :)Tanks fer appreciatin',Fuzzy"
