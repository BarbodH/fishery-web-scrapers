514172,Guest,2001-07-29 12:53:00,0,"I just finished reading ""Portage Bay"" by Paul I. Wellman. Copyright is 1957. What a great book. Recommended reading for anyone who fishes LOTW or anywhere for that matter, if you can find the book. It's about a group of fishin' buddies who stayed at Portage Bay Camp which was just North of the NW angle in Ontario, and a lot of their fishing was done in Shoal Lake via a portage. I wonder if Portage Bay Camp is still there? Any fishing done on Shoal Lake?"
514173,Jbob,2001-07-31 08:56:00,403,Portage Bay Camp is no longer there you can see where it was. A guide told me that Shoal Lake had been overfished by the Indians and they were the only ones with fishing rights today. Not sure if thats accurate or not ..

The guys in the book I referred to in my original post enjoyed some great fishing in Shoal Lake back in the late 50's, but probably contributed to the downfall. In one chapter they talked about their greatest day ever on Shoal and four of them caught over 400 walleyes. The limit was 6 and they kept 24 fish all over 7 pounds each. Of course we know fishermen never embellish stories, but I think it's probably pretty close to the truth. Thanks for the replies."
