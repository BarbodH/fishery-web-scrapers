514179,Guest,2001-07-30 05:08:00,0,Camping on crown land on Lac Seul is strictly forbidden. Last guy caught was tied to tree naked and left for the bugs.
514180,Guest,2001-07-30 17:18:00,0,Camping is permitted on Lac Suel at any fishing camp.Otherwise the other place you can camp is Broad lake or Sunlight lake areas. These areas are not considered part of the lake in regards to camping. Would verify this... second hand info.Both areas are located on the NW sector of the lake approx 20 miles from the nearest boat ramp. Can't recall any decent areas to pitch a tent other than at the outpost cabin! The bush around that lake is VERY dense! To camp at the place I stay cost 32.00 p/day for 2 poeple includes boat dockage/electrity/water/sewer and showers. Additional person(s) p/day 8.00 each. Another option is further up Hwy 105 (15 mi) is Packwash lake where there is a National Park for campingGood luck...
514181,Guest,2001-07-31 08:58:00,0,You can camp at Abrahm lake park just south of Souix lookout. Talk to Paula .You can boat in at many landings that are on the southeast side of the lake.Their number is 807-737-1247. Good luck!
