514166,Guest,2001-07-29 10:57:00,0,"I am leaving for Canada this Saturday. The bad thing is I won't get to the border until sometime around noon. I have not crossed the border during the day for twenty years. I have heard horror stories about the lines at International Falls. Can anyone out there give me some type of an idea as to what I might possibly expect for a wait in line. Also, I am going up Hwy 71 to Nestor Falls. How is the road construction coming? Thanks for any replies."
514167,Guest,2001-07-30 05:10:00,0,We came back over the border on Saturday returning to States about 11:00am. I would estimate the wait going into the country was about an hour.Jeff

Do yourself a favor and sacrifice some sleep to get here before 10am. An average Sat. line is about half an hour at 10:30am and continues to increase until those that get in line at about 2pm. These poor folks get to idle for 2-3 hours.If you have know option, make it work for you. I've seen guys grilling brats on the hood or tailgate of their truck, sitting in the boat rigging rods, Domino's has been known to deliver pizza to the line (ph 218-283-3444). Leave the barley pops packed up though, the local federales frown on it.Have funRoger"
