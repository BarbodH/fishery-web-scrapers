I thank anyone who would have some recommendations or opinions on places to stay, harbors, bait availability, etc on the island. I have never been there before, nor do I know anyone who has, so it would be a shot in the dark. I have found the Pelee Island website, but anyone with firsthand recommendations would be very appreciated. Thanks."

Can say this -- for mid to late Aug and early Sept the smallmouth fishing is fantastic. Four pounders are common, and fives are not rare. Crawfish on a single hook fished just off rubble piles (15 to 23 ft) are dynamite. Have a ball.Look for little humps surrounded by flat. Even the smallest seem to hold smallmouth. And, expect to catch more than a couple sheepshead in the process. East side of the island has been better than west the several times I've fished it."

I also didn't pay close attention to names of places, but the bait shop/store where we get licenses is on the southwest side of the island and does have a harbor with boat slips in it. On the north side of the island there is a large camp ground, but I again can't give you specifics.I did pay attention to the fishing. And, as I said earlier, it is fantastic smallmouth action. At the risk of being too repititous, look for the small rubble humps on the east side of the island (presuming you are there in mid-Aug to mid-Sept)."

Free camping at east camp ground.If you enjoy a couple cold one's after fishing you could stay at the westveiw tavern ask for chris.There are a couple people who sell live bait out of there home's or you can catch your own in the dyke that leads to the quarry on north/east side.Fish the west side from sherredon point to pelee club on east side near the chopper lauch pad there's a large hump,might find eye's there as well. Try wagon wheel reef and middle sister for eyes.On the south side try south bay 14-18 ft W/ tubes ,chrome colored cranks work as well.I usually go in late may catch and release a 100 a day no problem actually each one of these spots are capable of producing 100 fish each .good luck e me if you need more info"
