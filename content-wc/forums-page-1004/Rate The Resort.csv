513110,CJW,2001-08-01 16:20:00,167,Went to Basket Lake 6-25-01. Lake and cabins were great!! Not new but not that old either. And being I'm cheap it was better than anywhere else I've been. Three bedroom for 995.00 split between 6 people. Its usually that much per person. Waiting list is a mile long though. Unless you leave your deposit then your assured a spot come next year. This year we caught 8 walleye 28 to a 33.5. I caught a 29.5 my wife caught the 33.5. Weather was 80's to low 90's on one day. Cooled off nicely at night though. I'll be back next year. Craig
513111,Guest,2001-08-02 05:16:00,0,CJW: I've neve heard of Basket Lake. Where is it located and do you know how their Fall fishing is? Thanks KMR
513100,BD,2001-06-07 10:13:00,739,"Thanks for all of the replies on the ""favorite resort"" post. Fishing season is now in full swing and many of us have allready made trips to the waters of our Canadian friends (my own trip was delayed because of the kids wedding). To ""rate the resort"" we can forget about what the Fish and Weather Gods did to us and concentrate on things like service and accommodations. Were the cabins / rooms clean and well kept? How about the other facilities? Was the staff friendly and helpfull? Do you think you got good value for your dollar? And the BIG questions; Would you go there again? Just because the fishing was great? Because the total experience was good? For those of us into numbers you could use, if you wish, a number rating. #1 being poor and #10 being excellent. Thanks; And have fun fishing; Big Dave"

Was up there two weeks ago and it snowed, rained, sleeted, hailed and had 30-40 mile per hour winds for 4 days. Those people never missed a beat. They were doing everything they could to help out there guests with ideas to catch fish, or kill some time, whatever they desired. :)"
513104,Guest,2001-06-08 05:55:00,0,"Big Dave, Lac Seul Lodge is a high 10 in my book. Cabin we had looked almost new, new beds this year,very nice kitchen,new bath, large main room & a big covered porch with gas grill so clean I had to clean my own when I got home, just out of shame! We opted for the NEW lunds (17') with NEW 40 h.p.Yamaha 4 strokes.Man are we spoiled,electric start,elect.bilge pump,elect.baitwells,padded,pedistal seats with springs in the posts &at close to 10 mpg's ended up saving $'s too. The staff was super helpfull Dan (the owner) passed out the best advice I've ever gotten, every spot he marked on the map was right on. 'corse the weather was great for us (5/26-6/2)&we caught lots, even over the slot. Mostly walleye but when we wanted Pike or even perch to fill in the cooler Dan put us in the right spots. Even the fish house was better than 99% of places. I've got my reservation in for next year!!(352 more days!)"

We did good on them, but no Walleyes in that lake. The Spanish River is full of them, and Northerns, and that is where most of the cabins are)Hunting = 10 Here's a pic of the bear I got there.http://ccorn.ne.mediaone.net/sixgunn6/billsbear.gif"
