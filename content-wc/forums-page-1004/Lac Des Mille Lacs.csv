One of the things I notice is there are alot of people at the resort I was at that told me they caught large fish. And of course I did not believe them. One guy said he saw a 51in northern and had many 18 to 20lb fish on. Well here is what I found out. Most of the walleyes we caught were in 16 to 19 feet of water in the middle of the day. In the early morning they were in the 10 foot range feeding but as the sun came up they were deeper. I was fishing on a reef in the middle of Bolton Bay which has mud and rock on it. You can pull spinners or use Lindy rigs with about a 6 foot snell with night crawlers.You can also vertical jig the with a minnow or 1/2 a night crawler. Any question please reply"
