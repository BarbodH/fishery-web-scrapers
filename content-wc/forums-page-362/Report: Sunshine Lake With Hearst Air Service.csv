2013506,MrSimon,2013-08-07 15:21:00,922,"That's what happens when you spend a lot of time in the bush with little to no human contact. Honestly, you really should consider letting me go in your place on these trips so you can spend more time in the ""fast lane"". PS - Thanks for the tips on kids & fishing. I'll put them to good use."
1980882,Mike Borger,2013-07-25 12:16:00,1554,"Hey guys I recently brought my 6 year old son on a short 4 night trip to Hearst Air's Sunshine Lake outpost.Everything went off without a hitch. The camp was absolutely pristine, I was very impressed. Fishing wise I never count, but this time my kid did and according to him we landed more than a years worth of fish in 31/2 days of fishing. 368 to be exact.They were all smaller walleye, anywhere from 1-3lb's, typical fare for smaller northern Ontario lakes. However the sheer numbers and non stop action was exactly what I was hoping for with my son along.We did fish for and catch a ton of pike, and again all were small. I did have two larger fish in the high 30"" class, possibly even 40"" on and they both got unbuttoned boatside. For what it's worth I was told by the outfitter that Sunshine has some larger pike. While none were landed I did confirm their presence.We lucked out with the weather and bugs were scarce as overnight temps were cool and we had a constant breeze while we were there.All in all a great trip! Can't say enough good things about Hearst Air, they're a first class operation in my books.If you're interested I have a more detailed report with pic's and video that you can see here: http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/f...howtopic=70819Cheers, Mike"
1981018,Lovetofish,2013-07-25 13:13:00,458,Thanks Solo. Took my daughter on her first trip when she was 6 and she's been with every summer trip since. We came back two weeks ago from trip #14 for her.
1982682,new hips,2013-07-26 06:22:00,498,"Thanks Mike for another great report, looks like a great place to take the Grandkids."
1982826,Mike Borger,2013-07-26 06:58:00,1554,"Thanks guys, glad you liked!Anyone who's a dad can relate I'm sure, and yeah, this place would be perfect for your grandkids!Cheers"
2012642,MrSimon,2013-08-07 09:19:00,922,"My daughter is six and my son is 4 .... so I have a couple questions for the dad's who take young kids on big trips. 1. Do you worry about safety? Especially on a fly-in or at a very remote outpost. Even with lots of fishing/boating/first-aid/camping experience, I'd still be a bit worried being so far removed from help. 2. Do you worry about awesome trips like this ruining local fishing for the kids? My local fishing is OK, but its nothing like Canada. I'm afraid if I take them too early, they won't appreciate the local fishing anymore. 3. Do you worry about a ""bad"" trip souring the kid on fishing trips? For example, if the weather is bad or if the fishing is terrible .... or if something scary happens for the kid. What else do you think about before taking a young kid along?"
2013114,Mike Borger,2013-08-07 12:29:00,1554,"Can't speak for anyone but myself as everyone raises their kids differently.Of course I take precautions and extra care, but I never worry about being so far removed from help. But then this is coming from someone who in my younger years would spend anywhere from 2-4 months paddling solo throughout far N/W Ontario. I did that for years...hence the handle. I'm honestly more concerned that my kids will be hit by a car where I live in southern ON than any potential dangers on a fly in. On week long fly ins most outfitters will do a mid week flight check, and beyond that many outfitters, Hearst Air included have Sat phones for rent if you're really worried.The Sat phone is probably a smart idea actually.I've been bringing both of my kids north since they were born. First to my camp in N/W Quebec, then by the age of 4 on fly in trips.If anything it's fostered a huge love of fishing in my kids., my son especially. Since we got back from our latest fly in on Sunday this week he's been bugging me relentlessly to bring him to a local pond where he catch sunfish. He's got the bug big time and it's a direct result of the time and effort I've invested in him.When my son was a bit younger I always brought lots of extra things along to keep him amused: coloring books, toys, games, paper to draw on etc, etc... Also lots of kid friendly snacks and drinks for the boat.Now the kid won't stop fishing LOL! He'll happily fish with me for 10 hours straight in the boat then still want to fish off the dock back at camp. I do have one hard and fast rule though on these trips: absolutely NO electronics allowed (ipads, gameboys, etc..). They get enough of that stuff at home, it's just a distraction on these trips.As far as the last comment goes I've always explained to my kids that fishing is like figuring out a puzzle and I've always tried to explain to them exactly what we're doing and why. Even asking them for their suggestions and why they think it's a good idea. You need to involve them in the process and not just do everything for them. Mine understand the difference between fishing and catching now, and get just as much of a kick helping dad crack the code so to speak.If the weather turns we'll play games in the cabin and make hot chocolate, it's all good.Bottom line is I truly believe it's never too early to bring a child along. The memories are priceless for both adult and kid.Yes, it can be a lot more work than the usual buddy trips, but the rewards are great.Cheers"

2013346,MrSimon,2013-08-07 14:06:00,922,"This is really exciting for me to think about. I love fishing, but I love my kids even more. Combing those two loves would be amazing. Now if I could just get my wife into fishing, that would be the trifecta. Anyway .... do you think the kids should have already reached a certain fishing competence level before a big trip? Both my kids are quite comfortable in the boat and have some basic fishing skills .... but their casting accuracy is terrible and I'm at more risk of being caught than the fish. My six year old daughter talks to herself while casting ... ""left hand on bottom, right hand on top, finger on the line, flip the bail, aaaaaannnnnd release!"" Usually followed by clank clank clank as the lure bounces around in the boat behind her. Its adorable. Also, I love the idea of taking other things for them to do. Heck, if I took them to a fishing cabin and all we did was art projects, hike in the woods, play games, play in the sand, read books, play in the water etc etc etc ..... they would be in heaven. Going out in the boat and catching some fish would be icing on the cake. Ok, you've talked me into it. I'm off to make some reservations ..... nothing in NW Ontario though, cause taking them fishing is one thing .... taking them on a 20+ hour car ride to Hearst or Nakina is a whole other ballgame. New York will be fine for now."
2013466,Mike Borger,2013-08-07 14:57:00,1554,"In a word, no.Flew into Ribes lake north of Chapleau last week with my son, my friend and his young son.My buddies kid had never been fishing before in his life and had zero clue how to do anything.We mostly fished together in one boat so we could just help the kids.With a little bit of guidance my friends son was hauling fish in left and right. Mind you we kept it simple, either trolling or simply dropping a jig over the side of the boat and drifting.I've got some fantastic videos and pic's from that trip, should have something written up within a day or two."
2013482,Mike Borger,2013-08-07 15:05:00,1554,Well I'd like to think so. The reality is I'm morphing more and more into Walter Mathau every day. I tend to putter a lot and get cranky when people in front of me at the drive through order 10 meal combos when all I want is a coffee.My 9 year old daughter has been rolling her eyes at me a lot lately.
