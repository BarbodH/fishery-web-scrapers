2004745,unclepaully,2013-08-04 11:59:00,112,"1 gal will be plenty. A few weeks ago I camped for a week, 4 guys total. We cooked fish 4 nights, potatoes & onions about 6 times, and a little oil with the pancakes every morning. We still had a 1/4 of a gallon left over."
2008833,Blades-n-Beads,2013-08-05 19:26:00,484,"Butter flavored crisco sticks, tried it once, fish cooked up just fine, much easier to use and haul. Just use enough to cook fish in fry pan. Take small thermometer with as to not get shortening over 375 ish or it will burn quick and ruin the oil and fish. I guess same goes for deep fryers don't get oil over 375 max. But make sure oil is up to 350 anything less battered fish will absorb to much oil."
2008977,octanehi5,2013-08-05 19:56:00,1104,"Peanut oil Refined, with some left over bacon grease will take you to frying over 400 degrees, leave out the bacon grease and you can fry up to 450,One gallon of peanut oil weighs 8 lbs, I cooked for a week this yr in camp for 10 guys and did not run out of oil, Crisco burns at a much lower temp three times the fat content. out of 4 guys if you break down the weight its only 2 lbs per person in oil to cook for a week is a small price to pay, if you do not bring enough and or burn your oil the rest of your week you will be baking or grilling your fish"
2009129,fooddude,2013-08-05 20:32:00,24,Bring a hi oleic canola oil and a cone filter. Once you've used the grease 1/2 gallon a time - pour through the filter back into holding container - keep separate 1/2 gallons containers - one gallon will last a week no problem. I leave in a week for Lac Suel and can't wait. Peanut oil is does not last as long.
2009993,plumberjoe,2013-08-06 10:05:00,54,We started bringing 1 pound blocks of lard along with a gallon of oil for 6 guys for 1 week. Lard works great for pan frying.
2014298,MorganMan,2013-08-07 20:43:00,341,You can reuse the oil as long as you don't burn it as was already said. There are several inexpensive options to filter the oil back into the jug or into another pan. Take a look online and that should save you some weight.
2003354,forgop,2013-08-03 16:53:00,880,"We're allowed 100# per person for our fly-in trip (4 people). One person threw out a number of 4 gal which is absurd. We're going to bring up pancake mix for breakfasts. Some lunches will consist of pulled pork brought from home. We plan on frying a lot to eat, but how much would you allocate? Would you say 2 gal will be plenty? I really hate to use up 10# for excess oil not needed. How much is on your packing list?"
2003402,octanehi5,2013-08-03 17:22:00,1104,"one gallon of peanut oil, is plenty for 4 guys,If you are taking bacon save the grease and use that also. very good to fry fish in gives it alot of flavor,oil can be used more than once .be carefull of not burning the oil. most people on a fly in bring to much tackle.100lbs per man is doable,weigh everything before you go.I've been flying north for over 25 yrs. have a good and safe trip"
2003458,JayM5209,2013-08-03 17:39:00,1050,"6 guys for 7 days = 1 qt. of oil. That's what works for us, with plenty left at the end of the week. But then, we never ""deep fry"" anything."
2003578,forgop,2013-08-03 18:32:00,880,"I just love to fry my fish though and don't feel like becoming a ""chef"" up there and getting to fancy with it as I just don't feel like taking a host of different ingredients up there with us. We'll have a grill, but not sure if I'll make use of it or not."
2003586,Crede,2013-08-03 18:34:00,134,"We fry about 4 times in a week. 6-8 guys. Don't deep fry but use a deep skillet. Never used more than one gallon, so that's all we take now.We do make extensive use of the grill."
2003594,forgop,2013-08-03 18:37:00,880,"I've got an excel spreadsheet of our ""community"" items shared between everyone and our individual stuff. We're weighing everything now for the community stuff and it'll determine how much we'll have left to take in for personal items. It lists after coolers, fishfinders, food, etc. carried in exactly what we'll be able to take. When all is said and done, we'll probably be down to about 60#/person for tackle, clothing, etc. That said, when we're flying out, we're all wearing our boots and hopefully stashing a Plano box or two inside of our coats as our body weight doesn't seem to matter."
2003914,2746,2013-08-03 21:31:00,3206,We do 6 guys for 7 days with fish at least once a day and usually twice. One gallon does it....take two and you'll bring some home. Skillet frying requires 1/8 - 1/4 inch in cast iron skillet. That's not very much. Deep fry takes 1/2 gal. And you can change it once.keep a little back for other things before you start. 4 guys = 1 gallon!
2004033,Pooch,2013-08-04 05:39:00,4619,"Four gallons way too much! Two at the most! Take cheese cloth and filter the oil every other day. DON""T burn the oil or you'll be screwed. We take three gallons for four guys for fifteen days. Eat fish every other day.Pooch"
2004097,SinOrSwim,2013-08-04 06:26:00,1528,"If you go over, just pay the extra overage fee. Personally, I like to take what I want and what I think I will use/need to have a good trip. If that means paying a fee because of excess weight, then so be it. When we did our fly-ins for 15+ years, our outfitter always flew in extras later in the day or the next day on check flights. But, we would have paid the extra fees if needed. We were paying almost $1500 for the trip if we had to pay a little extra to take what we wanted, it was fine.Just me 2 cents. Have a great trip!!!!"
2004521,pikeman14,2013-08-04 09:51:00,144,"We used the crisco sticks, 1 very large skillet used up 3 sticks of crisco (or generic brand) Oil is much too heavy to drag along on a fly in. The crisco sticks are the equivilant of 1 cup of oil. They dont weigh much at all and come individually wrapped for easy transport. This really helped us make weight."
