2013338,matt31,2013-08-07 14:03:00,6,"Does anybody know how all that cash left in Canada, say the Red Lake area gets back to the US. I've often wondered how much cash is spent, on any given week during the fishing season in the Red Lake area. Most years our small group leaves 6000.00 with business for the week. This amount has to be a boatload. Between the resorts, outfitters, motels, gas stations, bars on so on. Just how does it all get back to the states. I've asked owners of outposts, and others, even a good friend bank president here in the states, nobody knows, or is'nt fessing up. NOW I'm just curious nothing behind anything other than curosity, so no need for some of you to start bashing or thinking criminal intent. Just in case I have no idea how Canadian cash gets back to Canada either. Thanks Matt"

2013730,phishfearme,2013-08-07 17:11:00,1242,AND - many Canadians visit the US in the winter - lots of the cash comes back then without all the fees associated with the banking system.
2013818,kzoofisher,2013-08-07 17:36:00,5144,"A lot of it probably never does, it will sit in the vault of a bank in Toronto until a bank Aruba wants dollars and then it will go there. It can be deposited in a local bank and then transferred to a currency exchange where it is given to Americans who don't want to go home wit $300 Canadian in their pockets. There isn't enough paper money in print to cover even a small percentage of our national purchases so the amount actually left in Canada isn't even a blip on the radar. I've heard that if the credit/debit card system crashed we wouldn't be able to draw enough cash to cover daily expenses for a week. Heck, if you go to the bank and try to withdraw $11,000 to buy a car they'll sic the Feds on you."
2018082,James Morris,2013-08-09 13:38:00,544,It's more likely the other way around - go to a bank and deposit a huge amount of cash - that's when the questions will come.
2018586,tackleman,2013-08-09 21:45:00,444,"my wife goes to the bank, changes Canadian to US then goes gambling in Minnesota, that's where my cash goes.Oh , I may make the odd trip to Owattana to visit the Cabela;s store just so I can spend my share."
2019177,campchick,2013-08-10 09:26:00,96,"You are correct in assuming that a lot of U.S. money is spent in tourist towns during the summer. A common mistake people make is assuming that the resort owner is ""raking in the dough"". While it is true that serious money does pass through his hands, unfortunately he does not get to keep as much as you would think. This is especially true if he has a fly in operation. Rates have not kept up with costs and margins are slim."
2021322,Fish_Heads,2013-08-11 17:24:00,154,Why would anyone in his right mind deposit cash in a bank for less than 1% interest ? (and risk fed intervention ?)Better to use a coffee can or under the mattress for sure !Or do like I do and invest it in reef runners & graphite rods...........Fish on !Fish
