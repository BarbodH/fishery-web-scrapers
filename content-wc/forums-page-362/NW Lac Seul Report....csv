We battled the wind for 4 days straight, which made travel down to Steamboat and McKenzie interesting. We did very well in Steamboat everyday and Mckenzie was amazing 1 of 2 days as it produced big fish. If your a McKenzie Bay newby like myself, be careful as not all hazards are marked!!! Shanty Narrows can be a white knuckler as well, but the extra 15 minutes is well worth it. Caught personal best 27 3/4"" Eye, even better releasing it. We caught numerous fish over 21"" and released every one, hope everyone out there believes in releasing these ladies to keep Lac Seul the greatest fishery on the planet. Oh, and the shore lunches, well, what a great way to bring 3 generations together!Cheers"

2013098,Mark R,2013-08-07 12:25:00,1538,Did you use a jig & minnow or spinners. Did you fish Steamboat Narrows?
2013226,mswope13,2013-08-07 13:02:00,73,"We fished the 3 islands to the east of Steamboat Narrows. Jig and minnow and found them between 15-25'. We battled a SW wind (strong) all week. For the first time in years fished mainly 3/8 ounce jigs exculsively. For the first 2 days, the wind died down in the afternoon, which made the ride back to Evergreen Lodge somewhat tolerable. The last 4 days put us in search for a chiropracter! Thursday we were all hit with one of those huge storms, lightening/thunder and we took shelter in one of the most furocious rains we've encountered."

Good thing for insurance. We go up the mid of September and stay at Gold Pines. It would be nice if they would mark the channel better, ecspecially through Shanty."
