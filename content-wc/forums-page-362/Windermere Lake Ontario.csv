1164658,jaggersr,2010-01-30 13:30:00,44,Looking at Happy Day Lodge on Windermere lake in early June. Ususally try to get to Chapleau area a few times a year. Bringing the wife and their price is very reasonable. Will be bringing my own boat. Any feedback or suggestions would be appreciated. Usually target Walleye but the versatility is very interesting.

It's the only camp on the lake, and Bob & Sondra do a very nice job (with their 2 younger sons) running the camp. Beautiful area.....be sure to take along a GPS as you'll need it when you get down the lake from camp (especially if you're returning in the evening). Details - lot's of smaller walleye (fish the beaver dams in the evening for eaters). Go to the far bays by their outpost camp, for larger fish. The camp has a lot of repeat customers (I mean for 20+ years) - nice folks. The bay in front of the camp has a lot of large fish, but good luck catching them (maybe at night ?) as I've tried with live bait - there's a ton of forage in there....as you go in and out of the bay watch your graph. The falls are worth a drive down (your wife will like it), and there's always a few walleyes down there. Lastly, take your time going back on the access road - it's like a washboard and will shake down your rig in no time if you go more than 15 mph or so....just have to take your time driving in and out (the camp has a decent ramp and docking in front of the cabins). Cabins are very clean - you'll like the camp as it's family friendly. PM me if you want more details.....if you're not on the fish, ask Bob to take you out for an evening, and he'll get you on some fish - he's a great guy ! Rich B"

Wife and I are looking forward to a week of Walleye and Smallmouth fishing. The Zimmermans sound like honest hardworking campowners. I will post a report later in the summer."

2020041,adempsey,2013-08-10 20:56:00,963,I was there a couple of weeks ago.Most guys were traveling out to Nicholson Bay to fish.I never managed to get out that far myself.http://www.happydaylodge.com/maps/map.jpg
2022106,MrSimon,2013-08-12 06:53:00,922,"We were up there in mid-July and did pretty well. We fished at the outpost last August too. Nicholson is excellent fishing for sure, but there are plenty of other good spots. Smallmouth are all about boulders. If you can find boulders in 3-12 feet of water, you'll find lots of smallies. Small perch colored stick baits like x-raps work great. Rattle traps also work very well ... especially when trolled along rocky shorelines in the evening. We have found that the further you go up the lake, the better the smallie fishing gets. In summer, we don't fish East of the narrows at all (although some guys do and catch plenty). If you want to catch lots of walleye, slow troll worm harnesses along shorelines that have good structure. Work shallower and deeper until you find them. Then troll at that depth until you hit a decent size pod of fish and stop and jig. Don't be too picky about what shoreline you start on. Just find something that has rocks on the shore and is somewhat close to deeper water .... the walleye in that lake are everywhere. If you do this for a few days, you'll have about a dozen good spots marked on your GPS that you can go right back too for the rest of the week. Sometimes the fish are small, sometimes big, and sometimes not there at all. Its a puzzle. If you don't have good electronics, then just keep it super simple and jig around rocky points. Work a point really well .... deep and shallow .... work all sides. You'll find them. In Windermere, the big fish are always on the spot on the spot. Which can be pretty hard to find given the enormous amount of good structure in the lake. I caught a really nice 27"" walleye in July on a saddle that came up to about 12' of water between two areas that went down to about 30'. It was also just at the end of a boulder field that dropped off deep too and the shoreline was kind of pinching in. You couldn't have designed a more perfect walleye spot. I caught the fish at 11:30 in the morning which surprised me. good luck!"
