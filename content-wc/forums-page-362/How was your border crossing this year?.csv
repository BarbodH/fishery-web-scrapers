2014178,38bill,2013-08-07 19:57:00,331,"Thanks, Just wondering. A couple of years ago while going through the Baudette crossing I just about gave the US customs agent a cardiac arrest when I declared a bunch of driftwood. He said that I couldn't bring driftwood into the US. I had done my homework and when I gave him the letters from the US Agricultural office that showed that driftwood was considered a ""finished"" wood product and could be imported (as long as it wasn't infested with live insects) he couldn't have been nicer. He thanked me for educating him and even asked me if he could copy the documents so he could post them in their office as they had been telling people that they couldn't have driftwood. I will add that it was a little scary at fist when I had to tell the agent that he was wrong."
2020954,farmnfish,2013-08-11 13:25:00,130,"Just got back from a trip up north. Going in was painless, the border guard was professional and cheerful. Even laughed when our 3 year old told him good bye. Waited about 10 minutes in line.Coming back to the US, wait was even shorter. The border guard was professional and a surly SOB. It wasn't anything he said just the way he said it. As if we were just there to ruin his day. And I'm this guys employer, he should at least act a bit respectful.Side note. It was my first time through Ft Francis, always before had gone up through the Soo. Seemed pretty disorganized, like I was driving through the yard at a paper mill. The Soo is so established and formal. Just different thats all. I was thinking I made a wrong turn, this can not be the border crossing."
2021042,Jatar,2013-08-11 15:02:00,169,"We crossed last week at Ft. Francis, 2 adults and 1-13 year old, we declared 4 cases of beer and 4 cartons of smokes (none for the 13 year old) , he asked our destination and said: Have a nice trip!, no duty, no search, couldn't have had a smoother crossing. Return trip was equally as pleasant."
2022530,tv4fish,2013-08-12 10:04:00,2694,"That's what irritates the _____ out of me. They can do the job that they are supposed to do, but - PLEASE --- lose the attitude."
2001177,Glenman12,2013-08-02 12:43:00,762,I wish we could get that agent..we pay thru the nose on our extra beer and booze...still cheaper than buying it up there..
2001385,Mike Kansas,2013-08-02 13:52:00,1463,"I have noticed the older I get the quicker the border crossings become. I guess it is because they think us old guys don't have the time or inclination to act stupid in Canada. I did plenty of stupid during trips to Canada in the 60s,70s, 80, 90s and maybe a couple years in the 2000s...hard to remember now. Anyhow the border crossings have been smooth and the Guards on both sides have been very nice. I for one thank all who make Canada possible. By the way we are headed to Red Lake this Thursday. Another week of relaxing and hopefully catching a few. Mike Kansas"
2001689,Bakefish,2013-08-02 15:52:00,1077,"I'm with you Mike. It seems like quite some time since I've been checked. Maybe age does factor in somewhat. I'm sure that when they run your license they get a rundown of your visits, so they've got me for 40 or so. Probably just jinxed myself."
2002570,Mayfly33,2013-08-03 06:25:00,5,"Just crossed back to the US yesterday at Grand Portage. After pulling through the scanners/picture taking machines to the booth I noticed the agents were laughing. The first question I got asked was, ""did you ever see the movie SuperTroopers?"" He said our car load reminded him of a scene from the movie as he handed our passports back to us. Not a question I was expecting but had a good laugh."
2006801,fourt2,2013-08-05 09:53:00,45,"Crossed through International Falls into Canada around 5am on July 27th. Took less than 30 seconds. Handed him the passports, got the usual questions, was told ""have a good trip"" before I even had the insurance card out of the folder.Came back through around 6pm on August 3rd, took 15 minutes. 14 of those minutes were waiting in line. ""Are you bringing back anything other than fish?"" was a new question for me. He pointed at my new Black Bear Lodge hat, so he obviously knew the answer. Told him we had some t-shirts, etc. ""Welcome back to the United States"" and we were off..Smooth both ways."
2006873,campchick,2013-08-05 10:06:00,96,"Regarding the toll booth. When I stop at the toll booth, I always use a card that has 18 crossings on it. The card is only good for about 18 months and has an expiry date. If I know I will not be crossing until the expiry date I will tell the person in the booth to scan the next few cars behind me so that I use the crossings up. Those cars behind me get to pass free. Maybe this is what happened when the previous posters thought the lady in the booth gave them a free pass. It would be nice if there was no expiry date though."
2006889,big popi,2013-08-05 10:08:00,635,"38bill,From what I gather, they were specifcally looking for wood that was recently fell or cut. Trying to keep ""invasive species"" from crossing the border the way I understand it. The agent did not give us any trouble, just asked the question.Brian"
2007113,pitbull,2013-08-05 11:38:00,45,One of the best crossing expirences since 911. Remember they are X-Raying and Scanning while going through. They know what they are looking for. This was just last two wks. in row.
2007241,tv4fish,2013-08-05 12:24:00,2694,SOOOOOO - Do you have any plans to cross next year around the end of June ???
2012322,Kmanster,2013-08-07 07:38:00,26,"Crossing last week, we were asked the usual questions....When he asked about the alcohol, we said 5 and 1/2 cases (for 4 guys). He handed us our passports and said ""Have a good time"". Coming back, we had about a 4 minute wait at 11:30 on a Saturday Morning. All at the I-Falls crossing."
1988506,UKBDM,2013-07-28 18:36:00,178,Quite a few of those years we have crossed in the middle of the night but for the last 4 years it has been Sat around 10:00am. Does she take a break because there hasn't even been a person in the booth until this year. This was also the first year we have had more than 4 or 5 cars ahead of us. Just lucky I guess!
1988538,Guest,2013-07-28 18:45:00,0,"Didn't know they did a ""Bridge walk"" up at the Soo. Thought that was at the Big Mac."
1988634,reconssd,2013-07-28 19:54:00,147,"Went through International Falls on Saturday, June 29th around 9am. Crossing was easy and we only have 3 vehicles in front of us. Came back through International Falls on Saturday, July 6th. They had 2 check through points at each station. Maybe we had 10 vehicles in front of us. Other than the drug sniffing dogs, crossing back in the states was easy too. This was probably the easiest border crossing (both ways) in at least 15 years."
1989394,big popi,2013-07-29 07:00:00,635,"We crossed at International Falls on July 18th, it went smoothly & quickly. We only got asked about alcohol & tabacco, it took about 3 minutes. On our return to the States on July 27th, we crossed about 6:45am. We were asked about driftwood & rocks. We went through in about 3 minutes, very courteous & professional."
1992697,deadhead1,2013-07-30 10:09:00,193,"My wife and I crossed at International Falls a few weeks ago. The young fellow in the booth on the Canadain side was asking his list of questions but you could tell he was bored out of his mind. He asked about booze and tobacco but he was talking low and I couldn't hear it. I asked him to repeat it and he did but again he was talking low and I am a bit deaf so I had to ask him to repeat it again. This time he yelled it out as if to say to me that I must be stupid to have not heard him the first two times! I thought it was a bit rude on his part but what the ****, at least we got his blood pressure up a bit. Even with that distraction it only took a few minutes both ways."
1992913,Mike Kansas,2013-07-30 11:45:00,1463,"Hump, Im sure the toll taker must have looked at you and thought ""He probaly won't catch very many fish. I think I will do him a good deed for the day"" By the way she charged me $100 because she knows we catch boat fulls. That's my story and I'm sticking to it. By the way Hump how did you do on your trip? Mike Kansas"
1994625,packpro,2013-07-31 07:56:00,695,"We have always had good luck crossing into Canada, as we hit the border around midnight. We cross at I falls/Fort Francis. Never a long wait. Coming back was always the problem. In years past we'd hit the junction and had to turn right and find the end of the line miles down the road. We actually shortened in a trip a day to see if a Friday crossing would be any better. It wasn't. A good day was 2 hours other times it was longer. However, the last three years have been very different coming back to states. When we get to the junction we turn left to a very short quick moving line. It appears that the manpower has doubled. They have three lines going with two agents staffing each line. That is six vehicles in process. We have crossed Friday and Saturday with no issues the past three years. Good job to whoever came up with the new process."
2000353,jiggster,2013-08-02 07:55:00,183,We crossed at International Falls on July 12. Smooth crossing no wait.
2000905,Walley Guide,2013-08-02 11:11:00,67,"The border was a breeze as always.....asked the basic questions. once again I had extra booze which I declared..., the agent ask if that was the only item I was over on coming into Canada, I said sure is...he said have a nice trip entered duty free again. Coming back into the US was simple, took longer to stop and shut off the vehicle than it did to be told have a safe trip, and see you next year."
2001033,38bill,2013-08-02 11:57:00,331,Why did they ask about driftwood? Its perfectly legal to bring it back to the states. I bring it back all the time.
1984458,55walleyes,2013-07-26 15:34:00,131,Very smooth and quick both ways for at least past 5 years. Our number will come up soon but nothing to hide so no big deal.
1984930,Glenman12,2013-07-26 19:41:00,762,we were also just east of the tracks on Fri June 14th but it moved quickly..maybe took 20 mins before speaking to the agent..went in and paid our duty on our extra liquor and we were on our way... Coming back we were 3rd in line..the usual questions and we were on our way..
1984994,Retired GB Guy,2013-07-26 20:15:00,25,"We Crossed into Canada Friday June 15 about 3:30pm at Internationl Falls. Took maybe 8 minutes only 2 cars ahead. Came back into the US July 20 about 9am that also took only about 10 minutes. As a side note, about 3 years ago when I was crossing and my son was behind in his truck, the local cabbie kind of forced his way between us just before the toll booth. As my son was about to vent to the toll lady she informed him that it is aloud, but the cabbie must pay the toll for the one he cut in front of. So son saved 10 bucks and would like see them cut in front again. LOL"
1985082,eyemike,2013-07-26 21:43:00,233,Crossed into Canada on the 5th of July no wait at all. Boarder agent even smiles. Crossing into the U.S. a week later was also quick and easy. I had a brain freeze and forgot where I was coming from. He told me to have a nice day.
1985418,PBsQuest,2013-07-27 08:12:00,49,"We crossed at the Soo two weeks ago heading into CA on a Sunday morning. One minute to get through. Coming back we crossed at Niagara Falls on a Thursday around 1:30PM. About a 30 minute wait in line, but right through with only the most basic of questions. Not a bad time either way."
1985786,Rich B,2013-07-27 10:48:00,1081,"Went up to Ontario for the Opener via Int'l Falls with 5 friends and other than about a 25 min wait, a few normal questions and we were on our way (I was towing my friend's rig btw).....it was maybe a 10 min wait coming back to the US, and a welcome back to the USA by the guard and we were southbound. At the end of June my wife and I pulled my rig up via the Soo, and again a short wait on the bridge with a few questions, and we were on our way to camp.....coming back, we had a much longer wait as it was the Sat for the ""Bridge walk""....once we got on the bridge, it was worth the wait seeing the people in their costumes and funny t-shirts....had a nice talk with the US border guard, and again southbound in short order. Best (and friendly) crossings ever.....though never really had a ""bad one"" with either US or Ontario border guards. Rich B"
1986642,UKBDM,2013-07-27 20:28:00,178,"I know this will sound crazy but ... I have been crossing at Int'l Falls almost every year since 1997 and this was the first year I have ever paid toll. It was also the first time I have been ""pre-screened"" by US Border Agents before going thru Canadian Customs on the way in. Anybody else experience this?"
1986986,tv4fish,2013-07-28 05:50:00,2694,OK -------- What's your secret?? We've been going since 1985 and every year we have had to pay the toll. I want to know just what exactly you do with the gal at the toll booth ???????????
1987426,Shotgun,2013-07-28 09:26:00,759,"Crossed into Canada on July 12 at International Falls with no issues. Returning on the 20th to the US however a different story. As we approached the crossing my fishing partner decided to take a picture of the vehicles waiting in line. As we were inline a guard was directing traffic. When we got to the booth the guard in a very pis*** off attitude said ""did you take a picture and was the guard in it?"". Partner said ""yes I did of the line of cars waiting to cross"". Guard said ""let me see the picture"". The picture was a panoramic view of the crossing. After looking the guard said ""delete it from your camera"". Which we did and then we showed the guard it had been deleted. No big deal as we understand their personal safety concerns. It was his shi* attitude towards us that was uncalled for. We were definitely talked down to and treated in my opinion disrepectfully. All he had to do was say "" Guys for security and safety reasons we don't allow picture taking. I'm requesting you delete that picture"". Just passing this on as a FYI, keep your cameras in the case when crossing the border."
1987946,walleyeduran,2013-07-28 13:11:00,286,"tv4fish, apparently you have to work on your humor because I would have posted the same thing."
1983090,MrSimon,2013-07-26 07:53:00,922,"We crossed at the Soo in a rented RV towing a boat. I expected some serious questions and most likely a light search. Crossing into Canada = Less than a minute at the booth, super simple questions and a ""have a nice trip"". Crossing back into U.S. = Some questions by the guys walking around peeking in windows while waiting in line. The guy at the booth just checked passports, asked some real basic questions, and peeked in the RV to make eye contact with all five of us. Really simple. It was the easiest and quickest crossings we've ever had."
1983218,Hump,2013-07-26 08:25:00,578,"We cross at International Falls. Got to the toll booth and handed the lady $6.00 and she said,"" Have a nice day."" She said, "" This crossing is on us!"" Not sure why, but was nice. No problems at all. I didn't go to Canada last year, so I was surprised the welcome center was closed. I went to the duty free store and it too had moved and I was the only one in the store."
1983306,kzoofisher,2013-07-26 08:57:00,5144,"Also crossed at the Soo, easy in to CA, slower line coming back but no issues. This was my first time north with the kids but not the wife and didn't have any of the questions checking her awareness that we were leaving the country that get asked at south bound exits. Is that typical?"
1983474,tv4fish,2013-07-26 10:01:00,2694,"Could you explain that, please ???Are you saying that you did NOT have to pay at the Toll booth?We also cross at I. Falls - usually around noon on a Saturday. This year the wait was a little longer than the past 4-5 years - had to go east beyond the RR tracks to get in line. Just the usual questions to go into CanadaComing back in to the U.S. on a Sat. at about 9:30 - the wait was about 15 minutes. Same usual questions."
1983850,Hump,2013-07-26 12:16:00,578,No we didn't have to pay the toll. She just smiled and said it was on us. Shocked me. We cross on Friday about 1:00 and had 1 car infront of us. Same the next Friday.
1983866,tv4fish,2013-07-26 12:23:00,2694,"WELLLLLLLLLLLLL - I'm certainly going to ""write my congressman"" about that .How could the Canadian Gov't pass up a chance to ""make a buck""? I think that ""toll-taker"" should be fired.I do believe that you may be the ONLY one ever to get a free pass. I have never heard of that before. (But, congrats)"
1983962,troutwater,2013-07-26 12:41:00,299,The Canadians asked the typical stuff and the US just asked if we had fish or goods we're bringing back and sent us on our way. It was easily the smoothest one I've had yet.
1984026,LOW1,2013-07-26 12:49:00,2828,"It's not the government's bridge. It's owned by the paper company who was ""encouraged"" by the US and Canada to build the bridge in exchange for the toll revenue.I'm betting that it was the toll-taker's last day on the job and she wanted to go out fondly remembered by all."
1984058,tv4fish,2013-07-26 13:08:00,2694,LOW1: Apparently you did not notice the liberal use of smileys/emoticons.....(I DO know who owns THE booth)............http://www.ezbordercrossing.com/list...-fort-frances/
1984250,Mr. Sauger,2013-07-26 14:23:00,285,"Crossing was a piece of cake both ways.Crossed into Ft. Francis towing my boat around 7:00 PM a few Friday nights ago. No lines. Canadian Customs asked the usual questions, asked my passenger to remove his sunglasses and we were on our way within 2 minutes. Crossing into International Falls a week later we had only a 2 car wait (at least 3 lanes were in use). US customs asked the usual questions and has a german shepard do the sniff test to car and boat. We were through in 2 minutes. Both agents seemed relaxed, US agent even kidded around a bit."
