2003945,forgop,2013-08-03 22:47:00,880,"I've never been and was wondering what we should expect in terms of how hot the fishing might be sun down to sun up. I've already looked into temps and it'll get down to mid 30's for lows the first full week of September. Not my preference to fish when it's that cold, but would like to give it a try if night fishing might yield something that might not hit during daylight hours. I know fishing in Minmesota with my dad 20+ years ago produced great results for some groups. Any advice as far at night time/thoughts on bait strategies? Thanks."
2004113,SinOrSwim,2013-08-04 06:30:00,1528,"We always go in early to mid-September and those ""average"" lows are just that. Average. The last several years, it has been down right HOT. Last year we went about the 6th through the 12th or something like that and we had only ONE evening that required a long sleeves. Granted, on the water was a little colder but it certainly wasn't what I consider cold.Historically, we have done very well in the mid to late morning and then again in the later afternoon/evening. We don't ever stay out til dark though and don't fish at night."
2004417,dog2,2013-08-04 08:57:00,198,"We fished different months of the year September is A Good time to fish, bugs are fewer in number and the fish are hungery. never fished at nite have had great fishing all day long .The only thing that we have noticed that when fishing late Sept the walleye will tend to be deeper in the early am but by 10 or so they are back on the reefs feeding. The only thing is the weather it changes fast cold today warm tomorrow,but the wind blows alot. Same baits just vary your presention. We are going late Sept this year also."
2004729,GWC,2013-08-04 11:56:00,1021,"We've gone up the third full week of September twice. Yes, its frost on the dock until 8:30 A.M. or 9:00 A.M. & you need cold weather gear. The water was rough both times but the fishing. Well, we took some mighty nice walleye & Northern(s) on both trips. I guess the fish were getting ready for winter & cold weather so the feed was on. We've never fished at night.Enjoy your trip, stay safe, catch lots of fish & oh yes, watch the weather. Storms can come in quickly & be brutal in September.Good luck Jerry"
2004881,Duflebag,2013-08-04 13:27:00,218,"We tpically go the second week of September for the past 26 years. As others have said, bring everything from clothes for frosty weather in the morning to shorts and tee shirts for 100 Degree days. It can be cold enough to see vapor in the morning when you breathe out to shedding the bottom half of the zip off pants by lunch. If it is raining like it often does in mid September, having some layers is nice. The fishing is beyond compare that few weeks of the year though. The fish are concentrated and have the feed bag on. I think it is the best fishing of the year. If you are a small mouth fisherman, the second week through the beginning of October is really special. The smallies move up onto the reefs, are concentrated and attack anything coming by. As the other members have said also, no bugs that time of year. Enjoy your trip whenever you go."
2005441,3M TA3,2013-08-04 17:52:00,2846,Amazing. Nobody has answered your question. They must think you need advice fishing in daytime too. Regarding fishing at night. Our strategy has been to locate suspended fish just off the drop offs before dark and then troll at dark on the top edge of those drop offs. Almost like spring fishing. Usually catch the big ones on the feed.
2005465,Obabikon,2013-08-04 18:16:00,2370,"A lot of that has to do with what lake you're in. Lakes with clearer water are typically better fishing at night. I'm on Lake of the Woods, and our night bite (while not horrible) isn't as good as the daytime fishing. 45 minutes or so after sunset is when I usually call it."
2007089,downriverbob,2013-08-05 11:33:00,880,"A lot depends on not only the lake that you are fishing but what part your fishing. I fish LOTW, but the Whitefish Bay section. It is ""gin clear"" so we had good luck in early evening/night last year for muskies. During the full moon on one evening we had three fish up on topwater lures, and caught two in 15 minute period of time. Our best luck for walleyes was during cloudy overcast windy days. We caught our biggest fish while trolling with planner boards in neck down areas and off of wind blown points. During these conditions the fish seem to be suspended in the above areas and were caught by trolling deep diving body baits. BOB"
2011681,Bill Krejca,2013-08-06 21:44:00,6107,"Re: Night fishing - If the water you are fishing in is fairly clear (such as Whitefish Bay) you might try trolling/ very quietly casting towards/past sandy beaches. If the water is stained or tends to be less clear (such as Sabaskong Bay) I have found the walleye bite to slow down as the sun goes down. The weather can be, as stated, anywhere from very warm to pretty cool. The absence of bugs just makes being there a treat. The colorful aspen and birch are a bonus to be appreciated. Best time of the year! Good luck! Bill Krejca"
