1955906,Mayfly33,2013-07-16 19:51:00,5,Cliff and Roma's. Not sure what to expect. First fishing trip to Canada but going with a group that have been heading up there for many years.
1956098,wallydave,2013-07-16 20:38:00,2151,"Mayfly the first trip North can be very special! But you should be warned, you may find yourself checking Canadian fishing websites on your return home. You may find yourself buying more fishing gear than a troop of scouts could use! You may also find yourself visiting WC on a regular basis! Enjoy your trip! But beware!"
1956314,bobo4030,2013-07-16 22:08:00,235,Man. Have I got THAT T-shirt? I'll be there with Pooch. See you in the Narrows. Rick
1956537,Mayfly33,2013-07-17 06:18:00,5,"Too late. Already checking the websites and planning next years trip. Also hit Cabelas. As an avid backpacker I'm looking forward to being in the woods with amenities (bed, electricity etc.) it's going to be great!"
2002626,Mayfly33,2013-08-03 07:28:00,5,"Excellent trip. Fishing was good. Caught many, many 18-19 inch walleyes, a few 22-24s and one 27. We also picked up a few Northern. Never had a bad day. Brought my tackle box along and the only thing I used was lead heads (next time my tackle box will be much smaller). The real key to our success was going with a group that have been fishing the lake for 30 straight years. An endless supply of spots to try which was hands-down the best luxury any fisherman could ask for. Met the original owner, Cliff, and he was quite the character. Heard a few good stories from him. His son Trevor and wife Leslie who run the camp were great hosts. Easygoing, accommodating and very hard working. It never ceased to amaze me that you could pull up to the dock after fishing, hand them the stringer and then proceed to gather your gear out of your boat. By the time we had our geared gathered up and walked the dock back to shore they had the fish cleaned, bagged and ready for the fry pan. Anyway...looking forward to the next trip."
2013554,Guest,2013-08-07 15:54:00,0,Reading these reports is getting me stoked up. I am headed up Sept 7-13. Staying at Cliff and Roma's.
2015249,jambi,2013-08-08 09:58:00,504,My good friend in Tulsa just booked a trip to Wildewood for June 2014. This will be his first time in Canada.
1868681,rdunk,2013-06-15 18:00:00,20,Anyone fished Lake Savant yet this year. We're going up the 21st. Would appreciate hearing how the fishing is. thanks
1870257,Pooch,2013-06-16 11:30:00,4619,I'm pretty sure others are watching your thread as there are several of us on WC that fish Savant at last once a year. Our trip to Savant won't be for another month. Before that I've got a trip to LS next week then Savant. (Wildewood)Maybe you are the first WC member to fish Savant this season?Sorry I couldn't help you. How about a report from you when you return?Leave a few for the rest of us.Pooch
1876786,rdunk,2013-06-18 08:07:00,20,"Will post report when we get back. We are going, as usual, to Cliff & Roma's. I do know that Trevor (son) and Leslie(his wife) have taken over at the camp and believe they had to cancel the 1st week because of late ice out."
1879129,Pooch,2013-06-18 20:47:00,4619,"Find out if Neil is still working for Roma's mom at Cat Track. If so please tell him hi from the Pullen group from the old wildewood days. Maybe he will remember us, we enjoyed and miss him.Have a good trip.Pooch"
1923642,rdunk,2013-07-05 09:28:00,20,"We had a great time and great fishing except 1 day the wind blew like the dickens and it was hard going. Biggest walleye our group caught was 26in but we caught quite a few in that range. Fishing was a couple weeks behind because of late ice out. Tried for lake trout but no luck. I don't think anyone was having any luck on lake trout. Trevor and Leslie are running both camps now so they do have some help Pooch, but no one by the name you mentioned that I seen. Over all we had great fishing and a great time."
1924442,Pooch,2013-07-05 19:23:00,4619,"Is Cliff around anymore? We really liked running into him and just shooting the bull on the water. Even though we were staying at Wildewood. He and the former Wildewood owner were friends.Were there any fish to be caught on the reefs? Especially the one between the camp and the wall? We always called that ""Cliff's Reef"".Anything happening at the narrows yet? Fish still back in the bays?Glad you had a good trip. We will be headed up there for fifteen days in about three weeks from now.Stay safe.Pooch"
1926834,rdunk,2013-07-07 06:19:00,20,"We fished mainly north of camp. Bear paw, NeverFreeze. Never fished what you are calling ""Cliifs reef"". We tried the narrows and lake trout fishing in that area but never caught anything to speak off and as I said I never seen any Lake Trout caught. Cliff and Roma never showed up during our stay but Cliff had been to camp a couple times Trevor said. Was hoping to see him but it never worked out. Good luck when you go up."
1927690,Pooch,2013-07-07 12:41:00,4619,"You just reminded me that my largest walleye (29.5"") came from the entrance to Bear Paw. The only fish I caught that morning! Go figure. Thanks for the report. I'll do the same when we get home in August.Pooch"
1930226,rdunk,2013-07-08 10:57:00,20,"We caught 3 walleyes at the narrows by the narrowest part. One was a little over 26"" and the othe 2 ..were around 20"". good luck again when you go up!"
1955722,Mayfly33,2013-07-16 19:13:00,5,Making my first trip up there on 7/25. Can't wait.
