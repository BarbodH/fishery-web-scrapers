I truly do love that descriptive adjective Zillion it was great!!!! Anyone, especially kids, who said they caught a zillion fish whether it was 5 or 500 had a great time. IMHO that is what is most important. Your report was fantastic and really put a smile on my face. I have been blessed with three boys and have been fortunate to have spent many a trip up north with them. I cherish those experiences and hope to continue them as long as possible. So please do not take my comment as a smart a** remark as it was truly intended as a compliment. I hope you have many more great trips with your family and friends in the future.Thank you,Larry Mac"
2015145,fourt2,2013-08-08 08:57:00,45,"Larry Mac, I'm fairly thick-skinned, and took no offense at your comment--but I did misconstrue. I'm the type of person that feels profanity is the crutch for a poor vocabulary, so having re-read my post I was thinking that I could have been more specific, and felt linguistically lazy...but I agree whole-heartedly that ""zillions"" conveys enthusiasm gained from a great experience. Seems I inadvertently selected the right word after all! Thanks for clarifying!-42"
2015185,Larry Mac,2013-08-08 09:22:00,530,"Hi Fourt2, Thank you for understanding the way my comment was intended. I truly and thoroughly enjoyed your report. Your report has intensified our desire to one day try BBL. Some of our other WC friends are heading up there soon and will also furnish a Great WC report. I can't wait to hear back from them. We are headed 110+ miles North of Red Lake on 8/24 and will report back when we return. Thanks againLarry Mac"

Going to be with wallydave and I'm looking forward to fishing a new lake(Red Lake) and spending time with a new fishing buddy. Any body with experince at Black bear or on Red Lake who has any suggestions would be greatly appreciatted. Thanks, Mike Kansas"
2006841,fourt2,2013-08-05 10:00:00,45,"Just got back yesterday from BBL (our 4th ""annual"" trip). Weather was challenging, and patterning the fish was a battle this time. Minnows were hot, crawlers were cold as far as producing. During our week, no really big walleye or pike--which was unusual. Still caught (and released) a zillion fish, just that they were ""unders"" instead of ""overs"". My son caught some nice Lake Trout (15-20 pounds), and a very well-fed pike (into the boat at 15 pounds, took another few ounces out of my hand as well). A bunch of 25-30"" pike.Another year of having a lot of hooked walleyes get t-boned by pike on the way to the boat, but not as many as last year. This is likely due to fishing different areas this year than in years past, I think.It seemed like the feeding fish just weren't where we expected them, so it took some time to find where they actually were...PM me if you want some more details, otherwise I'll probably type for hours...-42"

2008409,Larry Mac,2013-08-05 18:06:00,530,"Hi Mike, We are flying into Hornby LakeI ran into 2 guys this spring at the International Falls Border who were on their way to Black Bear and were they ever PUMPED!!! The absolutely love that place and that part of Red Lake. Black Bear Lodge has been on my Radar for some time. Myself and others are really looking forward to a great WC trip report from you and Dave. Have a great time!!!!Thank youLarry Mac"
2013514,fourt2,2013-08-07 15:23:00,45,"Larry, point taken. My son and I don't really keep an audit-proof count of the fish we catch, but I would estimate that between the three of us (daughter included, though she didn't fish much) we probably averaged about 30-50 walleye per day. Some days, we only caught half a dozen 'eyes between us (targeting pike or lake trout), but some evenings we couldn't keep our lines in the water, either. At one point, for about a 15-minute span, I would almost swear that they were building ladders underwater so that they could climb directly into the boat and not have to bother with the whole biting-the-hook hassle. Then, like a guillotine, they cut off. Unfortunately, out of all the ""zillions"" (sorry, had to do it), we were unable to boat an ""over."" Dave & Mike--have a good time up there!-42"
