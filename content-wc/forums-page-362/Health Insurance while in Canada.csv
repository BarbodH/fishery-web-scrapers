I just found out my insurance here in the states doesn't cover me in Canada unless it is an Emergency and then you have to wait and jump through all the hoops to get reimbursed. If so, any recomendations? Leaving late next week and headed to the Sioux Lookout area. THANKS!"

2016073,2746,2013-08-08 15:46:00,3206,That would be true of many policies. Very likely it would be an emergency but you would be forced to pay it out of pocket befor returning home. Our group has encountered that twice.....both times we all pooled our charge cards and eventually the victim got his money from his insurance after returning home? If that scares you many companies will sell a rider.....some for a short period of time. You might check with your carrier.

2016145,Golden Eagle,2013-08-08 16:00:00,2642,"Did an agent tell you you're not covered in Canada? Agent might be winging it. Would be better to read your policy or contact the company, not the agent. A lot of health insurance agents are order takers and lack knowledge about coverage on policies they sell."
2016177,Bearcat,2013-08-08 16:14:00,209,"I called the 1-800 on the back of my Humana Ins card. I told the lady I was going to Canada in a couple of weeks and asked if I was covered. She said I did not have coverage, but if it was truly an emergency, then I should seek treatment, pay the bill and submit for reimbursement. I found out yesterday, I have a medical issue that may require attention and Im willing to roll the dice and go on the trip. The odds are in my favor that nothing will happen...knock on wood...but what if?? Just looking to CMA. I had never even thought about it before. This will be our 6th trip up and nobody has ever given it a thought. Sucks getting old!!"
2016201,Golden Eagle,2013-08-08 16:25:00,2642,"I'd make another call to the same phone number and try for a different lady. First lady gave you a fuzzy answer. She did not know the correct answer.............or read your policy. It has the answer. Start with ""Coverages"" and hop around to look for your answer. Check the declarations page because it can add, subtract or modify coverage."
2016257,JayM5209,2013-08-08 16:42:00,1050,"Bearcat, I checked on my Humana coverage last year. The book you received from Humana - sections on coverages, etc. - clearly stated what you were told via phone. If emergency care is needed when out of the country, you pay the bill at time of service and submit a claim for reimbursement when you get home. That works o.k. for me.If you need medical care when you're on your trip, regardless of it being related to an existing condition, I'd sure define that as a legitimate ""emergency"" need. But that's just my interpretation.P.S. Both my wife and I changed to a different carrier this year, not because of this issue. We oldsters need to review and compare plans annually to choose the one that best suits our needs. Glad my wife is a retired health care manager so she understands the language and issues and can do th analysis for us!!"
2017594,pike50plus,2013-08-09 09:53:00,584,"a major medical type PPO, most plans other than HMOs cover out of country vacation travel , but yes the bill usually has to be submitted after for payment Especially if it is an advantage medical hmo plan, then ponly emergency care is probably covered."
2017914,2746,2013-08-09 12:14:00,3206,"Our last experience with an emergency involved a member of our group with an artificial hip. It went out while portaging a boat into another lake. Called the hospital, they met us with an ambulance at the dock and took him to the emergency room in Dryden. Could not fix it so chartered a plane to take him to the states. All had to be paid for on the spot. We pooled credit cards and he paid us back after he got home. Later reported everything was paid by his insurance, minus deductible, including the cost of the plane. A trip to remember!"
