1986794,Fred_G,2013-07-27 21:21:00,908,Stooped in Sioux Lookout today for lunch at Knobby's. Found the door locked and a closed sign in the window. Does anyone know what the situation is? We always enjoyed eating there and thought the food and service was great.
1986978,tv4fish,2013-07-28 05:45:00,2694,"I think Knobby's is ""missing out"" on a LOT of business. For years, that is where we would go for breakfast every day of our trip (week). They had a breakfast buffet that was fabulous. They discontinued that more than a few years ago. We still would go there until this year, because they HAD a good ""fisherman's classic"" breakfast, and you can watch the planes come and go while you eat. When they changed their ""open"" hour to 7 a.m. from 6 a.m, that did it. This year we went just a little further west to the Wellington. They DO open at 6, and in our opinion, their breakfast is better than Knobby's. At least they WERE still open when we were up there in June???"
1987754,stjoeguy,2013-07-28 12:04:00,979,"We went to Knobby's for dinner on 6/22. The first thing we noticed was that the stuffed beaver and the bulletin board full of dollar bills were gone. There were very few people there. We ordered Bloody Marys and were told they didn't have a liquor license yet. Apparently, the restaurant had been sold and the new owners were slow getting it going again, so we left and had dinner at the Wellington Inn. Sorry to hear that things haven't improved over the last month. Dinner at Knobby's with a Bloody Mary was our beginning of the trip tradition."
1987802,stjoeguy,2013-07-28 12:16:00,979,"By the way, Fred, thank you for the fishing spots on St. Joe. We enjoyed fishing both The Abyss and Nebraska Reef. Hope you had another great St. Joe trip."
1988226,ScottL,2013-07-28 16:19:00,733,We ate there last Sunday evening (6/21). The first thing I noticed was that they only had one kind of Canadian Beer(Molson Canadian). The second thing was that there menus were sheet paper on clip boards. They didn't have any sweatshirts or Tee shirts for sale either. The waitress said that they were under new management.
1988666,Fred_G,2013-07-28 20:00:00,908,"Glad you had a good time! Our week was cold, wet and windy. It felt like fall. We managed to catch some but certainly not the numbers we are used to. I'm going back next weekend with my wife. Hope the weather is better this time around!"
1989506,Bitinlight,2013-07-29 07:17:00,95,"We ate there the first of June. Inside the decor was not what it use to be. Pretty plain and simple-so was the menu-nothing special. Buddy had a grilled chicken sandwich. It was cold and still had the skin on! At that time, they had no liquor license either. They were/are under new management. Just not the old Knobby's at all. Second trip in July we ate supper at the Forest Inn. Great menu and great food. After the long drive to Sioux Lookout, they even had frosted mugs for beer! Nice outside deck with a nice view of the lake."
1990178,rockape,2013-07-29 10:42:00,215,"We had the same bad experience. Nobody there, different menu with fewer choices, poor service, and missing the vibe the place used to have. I got some egg sandwich thing, asked for some ranch dressing, and got some buttermilk stuff that was aweful. Told the waitress I didn't like it. And they still charged me $1,50 for it. Won't be going back. The Wellington has great food."
2018618,JAMOKIN,2013-08-09 21:55:00,48,I was there in mid july and ordered the walleye diner 24 $ (thinking I am in walleye country and price was not an issue as work was paying) and recieved a nicely prepared walleye filet from a friging 9 lb walleye.Not very tasty.
