Had fantastic fishing. 2 of us caught close to 350 walleye for the week in spite of wild weather shifts and multiple thunder storms. We each caught personal best 30 inch walleyes. I also added a 28 inch fish. We also caught many fish greater than 20 inches. I have to thank Barry and Steve for all the information about lake Hebert. They were right we were not disappointed with the quality of the fishing and the facilities. The boats were great, and engines well maintained. The best spots included 2 jug island,the humps in the middle of the upper lake, the opening up at the north end, and gull island. The road from Parent to Clova was very good but on our way out the road from Parent to St. Michel was terrible with bad wash boarding. All the rain we had must have caused the problems. Can't wait for next year. Would highly recommend Hebert to anyone wanting the chance to catch a trophy sized walleye."

Good to hear you had a great time"

2011713,trapperbob,2013-08-06 21:52:00,45,"Didn't run into them. They must have Come in on Sunday. We left on Saturday. We did meet up with Barry and his family on the night before they left. We met right on one of the spots in the upper part of the lake. I left a marker there at 10 feet of water. That's the area where my brother in law caught his 30 incher. By the way we named the small rock island near the main island with the 30 plus foot hole small gull island. A lot of gulls there and excellent walleye fishing in 22-30 feet of water. We fished there twice and caught several walleye. Our overall favorite area was 2 jug island, near camp 25 where we were staying. By the way on Saturday August 3 rd a friend of mine Dr. Higgins was killed in Ontario while fishing. He was struck by lightning while seeking shelter with his daughter. So when everyone goes fishing up there watch out for thunder storms. They tend to pop up very quickly. We had storms on 4 or 5 days while at Hebert. Get to shore and to the cabin if possible."
2012042,octanehi5,2013-08-07 06:05:00,1104,"We have put many a marker bouy on that hump and they always blow away, sounds like all the hot spots produced fish. I never fish farther south than the bouies that are 1 mile south of camp 25,then what you called two jug island( is Clorox Island,Sea gull island, the hump,The slot in the north bay,Have been putting fish in my boat for 10 yrs.when the fish are not biting in any of those spots its time to take a knap. Sorry to hear about your friend,the lighting storms up there are very volitile.My friend John did fly into camp 26 the same day you left. The lac sounds like its in its fall mode,catching a number of big girls like you guys did proves that. Fall and winter come very quickly up there.My group is already booked back in camp 26 the last week in June 2014.If anyone on here is going to the Harrisburg show, I will be in Air Tam's booth the first weekend.stop by and say hi.
