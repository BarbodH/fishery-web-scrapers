I still maintain that if you could only go to one fly-in, the best choice would still be to go to Eddie's. I again had an amazing time. The place is truly special and had amazing fishing. I will say that the Northern were a little elusive this time, but many 35Â” plus were caught and the Walleye were biting like they had never had a meal before. In addition to the fishing and atmosphere, the camaraderie again between all the fisherman is bar none. Even though this is a fly-in outpost there are several amenities that make the adventure even better: electricity, running water, shower, wi-fi and a satellite phone. I do not see how anyone could go to any of Eddie North's camps and not have an absolutely AMAZING time and experience and make memories that make life worth living!!! As I mentioned before, I definitely will be fishing more in Canada because of this experience, and I have."

2016361,Alex,2013-08-08 17:56:00,8,"The water levels are down from what they were in the beginning of June, but you can still get pretty much everywhere, you just need to be careful of the rocks which are marked pretty well with buoys"
