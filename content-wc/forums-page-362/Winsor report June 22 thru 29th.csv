2019577,TIGHTLINER,2013-08-10 15:00:00,223,Hi tooski... How was the water level on the lake?? Thanks.
2019681,tooski,2013-08-10 15:50:00,393,Well my first time there so I have no base to compare but there was a very strong flow so I'm thinking it was a bit high. Ties right into Beteau so whatever the reports were out of there should be comparable. I will say the lower end downriver is absolutely full of boulders that may or may not be an issue depending on levels.
1928066,GOBIG,2013-07-07 15:28:00,126,"Getting sick is the worst thing ever on a very important vacation. I enough Keflex and 2 Z Packs. I also take in other meds for the ****s, cough, and pink eye. Some guys in our group would argue in years past until the year everyone got sick but me. I work in a hospital, so I even get stuff to do a round of stitches. All this extra stuff only weighs what 2-3 lbs. Worth ever penny to me and my group. After the year we all go sick, we use hand sanitizer the whole way up to Nakina..."
1928074,tooski,2013-07-07 15:30:00,393,"We use a ""First Need"" water filter. Popular with canoers and never had an issue prior. I'm thinking she had a bug when we went in and I got it from her. Don't know if it would be food poisoning since I got sick three days after Cindie. Not an expert though so I suppose it is possible. Even with the filter I think we will be boiling also on future trips. Whatever it was I want no part of it again...."
1929770,SinOrSwim,2013-07-08 09:12:00,1528,"Cephalexin is another good one to take. Covers a lot of stuff. Strep throat, skin infections etc. Just have to make sure if you take something up there someone knows what the heck it is so you don't feed it to someone with allergies. Penicillin and Sulfa allergies are very common. Technically, you are not supposed to share anything so I'm not ""advocating that""."
1938153,phishfearme,2013-07-10 13:27:00,1242,ok - I hope this cheers up joe for a while - at least until football season starts. phish
1938249,phishfearme,2013-07-10 13:41:00,1242,"some thoughts on tooski's experience: - given that Windsor is a major river system ""lake"" (actually a widening in at atta is a better description), I guess you can locate/choose flow spots without a sounder. BUT, for me, I would remove from my gear something that would cover the sounder - almost anything! this is especially true for shield lakes but less true for james bay lowland lakes where there's not much underwater structure anyway. to me - no sounder = blindness = poor results. - we used to use one of those hand filters and two things happened. first, they jammed up with all the suspended crap in the water. secondly, the filter can get small breaks in the system (especially under the jammed situation where more force is needed) and passes nasties thru - diarrhea and sickness then follow. from now on we ask the outfitter to either supply water or we will use his propane to boil everything we drink - which is usually quite a bit of water given the frequent dryness of the land up there. given these choices - our current outfitter sends in water with prep and/or check flights - along with some ice!! hope tooski is all better again - which given his location on the ""mistake on the lake"" can't be all that good! phish"
1969153,5 of Diamonds,2013-07-21 17:21:00,151,Gonna try and keeep this thread alive and kicking. Anything else anyone can share about any happenings @ Windsor?
1970457,Larry S,2013-07-22 09:32:00,665,"I fished Windsor in 2006,my report is archived under Larry S. I sent Tooski a map of all the spots we fished. When we were there the water was very low so we were unable to explore as much as we wanted. We also had a day and a half of monsoon rains which curtailed our fishing time. I'm sure given fairly decent weather and average water that many area's could be fished and explored. The time we were there the fishing was very good for both walleyes and pike. I will be watching this thread for more reports on Windsor lake Larry S"
1972649,5 of Diamonds,2013-07-22 19:04:00,151,Hey Larry S:Yes. I've read your trip report multiple times. Just hoping to get more info. Thanks again!
2017898,Alex,2013-08-09 12:00:00,8,"Hi Tooski I would love to know more information about your experience at Windsor. How many Walleye were you catching, how big were they, how long were your out fishing each time? I know you didn't target for Northern, but did you catch any at all?"
2019481,tooski,2013-08-10 13:56:00,393,"Hey Alex, Just returned from Abamasagi and saw your questions. As explained in my first post we were limited in many ways. The two spots we did fish were very good. I would say we fished maybe two hours in each spot. Didn't count the fish but when we left we were still catching them. We also did a bit of random trolling without a lot of success so add a few more hours. No great size to the walleye but they were not small. Yes we accidentally hooked quite a few northerns. PM me if you would like more info"
1922466,tooski,2013-07-04 16:38:00,393,"The dock was MIA after a 4 year vacancy at Windsor. For that reason we had to fly in on the 185. With the more stringent weight restrictions we were not able to take in a depth finder, ice, canned goods, coleman lantern, x-tra rods, reels, etc....The trip began ominously. Got to Windsor around 4 PM. Spent the rest of Saturday cleaning the cabin and grounds. We have all week to fish, right? Late Sun morning (we have all week, right) we finally get out. Taking it slow with no depth finder on a strange lake we come across a likely spot around 15 minutes from camp. Just like this forum it's ""Walleye Central"". Pretty much non-stop for maybe 45 minutes. Emptied the tackle box- jigs, spoons, spinners, homemade lures, didn't matter. If I cast it twice and no walleye I put it in a bag to toss in the trash back at the cabin. Back to the cabin for walleye dinner and that evening back to the same spot- same results. Sun nite the wife gets very sick. Don't leave the dock Mon or Tuesday. Wed 4 AM I get sick... Biblical ill. Don't leave the dock Wed or Thursday. Still a bit nauseous Friday but head out anyhow. Pass our usual spot and go upriver to where another lake empties into Windsor. Dejavu. Small rapids and continuous walleye action. Probably should have headed another couple miles upriver to where the serious rapids dump into Windsor but opted to head back to camp. We never fished specifically for northern but I believe someone like Rocky or Larry that have experience with the big girls would do well on Windsor since it is the same river system as Beteau. Here's what I know about Windsor- Very large lake, myriad of islands and bays, miles on miles of shoreline, at least 2 areas where the walleye fishing was outstanding for us. The river flowing through Windsor is powerful. Any neckdown area had strong current. Lots of boulders and islands in the lower third. If you plan on Windsor in the future the best I can do is mark the two areas we had the great fishing at. Without a depthfinder and more lake time I couldn't find any serious structure. Joe T PS- Eddie flew in some beer and a coleman lantern for us at his expense and as always Nakina Air did all they could to make our trip worthwhile. [email protected]"
1922546,5 of Diamonds,2013-07-04 17:23:00,151,"Tooski: Thanks for the report. It is most appreciated. I hope you and your wife are feeling better. We've booked a trip to Windsor for Sat 28 Jun - Sat 05 Jul 2014. This report is right in our wheelhouse. Our group can't get in there soon enough next year. Again, thanks and any other tidbits of Windsor information you may have would be greatly appreciated. Best."
1926322,wantabigone,2013-07-06 19:53:00,39,Hopefully your next trip is better. That was some bad luck.
1927418,tooski,2013-07-07 09:50:00,393,Thanks Bigone- It has been worse. Three years ago I spent the vacation in Geraldton hospital with a broken back and fractured ankle after the wife met a moose at 4 in the morning. At least I had some drugs then....
1927586,SinOrSwim,2013-07-07 11:30:00,1528,"we were not able to take in a depth finder, ice, canned goods, coleman lantern, x-tra rods, reels, etc....The trip began ominously.Do they not do check flights and could this stuff not be brought in later??? I would hate to go on a week long trip without a depth finder.I also wonder why it took so long to clean the cabin? Was it that dirty or just not to the wifes expectations? Just curious. Seems like that stuff should not be an issue. Especially, this early in the year. The people before you need to clean imo.Stinks you guys got sick. We have been pretty lucky but I got sick a couple years ago. We take in antibiotics and it saved my trip I think."
1927626,tooski,2013-07-07 12:05:00,393,"As I said , the cabin was vacant for about 4 years. We knew it would need a lot of attention and it really wasn't an issue. Had I known we were going to get sick I probably would have gone out Sat but we were in no hurry. Also we overnited in Hornepayne so we didn't get into Windsor till late Sat afternoon. No check flights mid-week. Not unusual I don't think. Last three trips to Larus Lake, Anjigaming and Richter did not have mid week flights. Good call on the antibiotics. Definitely going to find a place in the med kit for some. Take care Sin....."
1927642,SinOrSwim,2013-07-07 12:22:00,1528,"Ahhh, that makes sense. I didn't grasp that from the original post that it had been vacant for 4 years. Makes perfect sense now.And yes the antibiotics make a big difference on a fly-in. Whether it be lungs like I had or a year when my brother had an infected tooth. Several in the group are pharmacists so our Dr. writes one knowing we won't use it unless needed. Plus, nice to have something in case you get a dirty hook stuck or something like that."
1927682,Ogoki,2013-07-07 12:37:00,291,"Always trying to learn and be more prepared . I do take Amoxicillin for tooth root infection. What other antibiotics do you take with you and for what ailments? Thank you! I even take peroxide for the dogs in case they eat something ,where I want them to vomit ,to get rid of whatever bad they have eaten."
1927930,TIGHTLINER,2013-07-07 14:49:00,223,Glad you are better... Did you boil or treat your water before drinking it?? Or do you think it was a bug you picked up back in the USA???? Thanks
1927954,TIGHTLINER,2013-07-07 14:56:00,223,Did you treat your water or boil it before using it?? Or do you think you picked up the bug back in the USA???
