Anything I want, seems 30% more expenxive here, plus the fact that the commies in govt do things like EMASCULATE the Garmin Rinos radio range. I had to get a Rino 11o from the USA to get the full 5-mile range...saved a BUNDLE on the Sony camcorder too. Waiting for a $150 barrel/scope combo for the old Mooseberg 500 from WallyWorld. Do you have ANY IDEA what I'd get SOAKED for a slug barrel up here? More than I paid for that shatgun, believe me. Qannadda's a CONSUMER RIP-OFF...that PASSPORT ISSUE is merely designed to TRAP QANNNADDIAN CONSUMERS $$$ here,,,,now that the dollars are more equal in value....."

563497,San Chan,2007-02-20 22:01:00,2406,Anyone knows how much Duties/Taxes/Surprises I have to pay if I order a GPS/Sonar from BPS or Cabelas USA To Toronto Canada?
563499,Guest,2007-02-21 04:58:00,0,"Hi , If made in Canada or USA due to are free trade agreement NO DUTY but GST , PST & a small BROKER FEE ( $10.00 to $15.00 ) If not made in USA or Canada look out Duty could go as high as 30%"
563500,retire55,2007-02-21 07:13:00,1029,"You can check out the total cost breakdown of your Cabela's purchase by just going through the online checkout process. Information you are after comes up before you have to input credit card information. For a Lowrance LCX-27 Series Sonar with GPS retailing at Cabela's for $999, other charges were $19.50 shipping and handling, $139.86 taxes and duty (no duty - just GST and PST on $999) and $3.50 broker fee. Total was 1161.86 USD."
563505,mcdee,2007-02-21 11:25:00,276,Is this delivered right to your door? What happens if that item breaks and you have to send it back? Might be a real head ache.
563507,retire55,2007-02-21 12:16:00,1029,Cabela's web site has the answers to your questions and concerns.
563508,mcdee,2007-02-21 12:32:00,276,I checked out there site and Cabalas looks like they'll do everything in there power to help get the goodies shipped with 100 percent satisfaction. I guess having to return anything is a pain locally as well .Sometimes you can get a better deal in the US! :cheers:
563513,Guest,2007-02-21 18:52:00,0,A good company to deal with is www.iboats.com They shipped my order last summer in two shipments & I paid tax's & broker fees twice? I tried dealing with UPS ( Forget UPS No Help ) Iboats.com own up to there mistake & look after it for me ? Great internet company?
