563272,rpieske,2007-02-08 19:20:00,1276,"I don't know the total inches, but is hasn't been much. I hear you can see the brown in the fields around Emo. Looks like another low water year on LOTW."
563274,Guest,2007-02-08 19:22:00,0,"Information found here:http://www.theweathernetwork.com/fea...snow/index.htm Less snow than normal so far, and LOW water levels come spring if the snow and/or rain don't come in the interim. NWO Fishing Bum"
563343,Skylane,2007-02-12 17:48:00,101,"Just got back home to Illinois today after a week at the cottage(east of Dryden). There was 12 inches or less of snow on the ground, usually quite a bit more than that by this time. Two years ago at the end January the snow in the bush was waist deep. The lake is still low, like when I left the first of September. The tempertures are quite low right now and and when it is this cold it does not snow much. One morning last week when we got up and looked out at the thermometer it was -40F, most days it would warm up to near 0 in the day. If we get the snow tonight they are talking about, there will be more on the ground here than in NWO."
563389,rpieske,2007-02-14 15:32:00,1276,"Hey Skylane: The mayor of Nestor Falls/Sioux Narrows was down here in Naples, Fl a couple of years ago. My wife asked him how cold it was in Nestor Falls that day. He said -40 degrees Celcius. She asked him what that was in Farhenheit. He said -40 degrees Farhenheit. I didn't believe him and had to look it up. Sure enough....they are exactly the same temperature at -40. We got a laugh out of it."
563663,Skylane,2007-02-27 05:12:00,101,"Bob, just got back from float plane training in FLA and am catching up on the forum. Yes you are right about the C and F difference at -40, kind of comes together in that temp range. What a shock going from -40 to +70 all in a weeks time. I hear the northlands have doubled the amount of snow on the ground since I left. Maybe that will help the lake levels a little. Hope to get up again around the middle of March. When are you heading North? Steve"
563671,rpieske,2007-02-27 19:09:00,1276,"Steve: I should be back in Nestor Falls around May 15th. Where did you do your float plane training? I winter in Marco Island, FL every year. Still down here. It was a pretty cool February, but January was nice. Hoping March will be nice and warm. You are right about those temperature changes. The wife and I came back from the Dominican Rebuplic one January to an inch of ice on our car at the airport and wind chills in the -10's. I still had our light clothes on from the Caribbean and had to chip the ice off to get in the car to go home. Froze my toukas off."
563673,5thsuit,2007-02-28 07:08:00,54,"I talked to Faron last week in Ear Falls he told me about a foot on the ground, last fall it was dry so expect low water levels unless something changes."
563674,Guest,2007-02-28 07:28:00,0,"Well...we HAVE had drought conditions here for 3 years running...no-one thinks of it like that, because there are practically no farmers up here. And the few that are out there (mostly dairy), are coming into town to get water because wells go dry in winter now. Lac Superior is down AT LEAST 12 inches. My favorite river looks sick, 1/5 normal water flow I bet. I'd imagine you can go just about anywhere up here, without snowshoes....."
