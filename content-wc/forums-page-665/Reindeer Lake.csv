563534,Guest,2007-02-22 19:06:00,0,"Hi guys, Planning a trip to Reindeer Lake. Can anybody tell me the driving distance from Lynn Lake, Manitoba to the boat landing in Kinoosao, Saskatchewan? Trying to do this trip on a reasonable budget, but still wanted to access the middle to northern portion of the lake. From what I understand, there are no motels or accomodations in Kinoosao. Was thinking about staying at a motel in Lynn Lake and driving to the boat landing in Kinoosao each day. Does this make sense? Or anybody else have any other ideas? Thanks in advance, ""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"

The road from Thompson to Lynn Lake is no picnic either. You might try contacting the owner of Grand Slam Lodge, Floyd Olsen, this lodge can be driven to, right past town, you might be able to work out a price for renting a cabin that you can live with, the only other option is to camp, but it is not practical to drive from Lynn lake to fish Reindeer every day, tried it, only for a day trip , takes way too much time away from your fishing, besides fuel up in that neck of the woods is very expensive. pull up www.grandslamlodge.com"
