563459,Whopper,2007-02-19 10:58:00,340,"Never had a problem taking our flat of crawlers until last year. We always clean them and put them in store bought bedding for the trip up. Last year we were checked and the custom agent rejected them because they had pooped? What a hassle, had to have a guy return them to the US side and dumped them and bought another flat in Thunder Bay. I think from now on we will call ahead and order from the outfitter or from one of the local bait stores in the Thunder Bay area. You'll pay a little extra but you won't have any hassles. Whopper"
563697,Guest,2007-03-03 07:36:00,0,"For me it's not about the money but about quality bait. A week before our trip, I pick up a flat of worms. I mixup a 5# bag of Buss bedding and put it into an old cooler. After after washing the worms and putting them in the cooler, I cover the bedding with a few sheets of news paper. I freeze a few blue ice packs, put them in a ziplock bag and put them into the cooler. The bag helps capture the sweat off the ice packs. Rotate packs on a daily basis. You can keep worms like this for a month or more. This gives me worms that are meaty, firm and lively, about as fat as your little finger. I have seen the worms you get at the resorts and they don't even come close to mine. You only have a limited time in Canada, you spend a lot of money on the trip, why would you short change yourself when it come to your bait. If your willing to spend $5+ for a crank bait why would you settle for a 1 cent worm?"

Was wondering how you guys keep them good for a week and what packing methods are required to get them across the border.. My crew has only used minnows or artificials, and I was thinking about changing things up this year.. We fish LOTW if it matters.. Thanks Much Eric"

One more thing about worms is they never craw out if there is light. With light, you don't even have to cover. Without light they will be all over the 5th Wheel by the time you arrive.:-)"
563400,VMS,2007-02-15 10:31:00,1103,"In order to cross the border with your nightcrawlers, they must be in a commercial bedding. They cannot be in dirt, moss, etc...no type of ground cover from the states.. Keep them cool, put some used coffee grounds in after you cross the border, and they will be nice and juicy, ready for that walleye to come eat em. Steve"
563402,Guest,2007-02-15 12:00:00,0,"We stop every trip at Cabelas in Owatonna,Minn and pick up their ""Canadian Pack"" of Crawlers. Never have any trouble at the border and the worms are always in great condition."
563404,2746,2007-02-15 13:58:00,3206,"We do what oh yeah again does (Cabelas) but prior to that I would pack them in an insulated cooler, cover the packing (not dirt) with newspaper and then lay one of those re-freezable frozen bags on top. Traveled well and would keep them all week if you set the cooler in a shady area.....usually under the cabin porch."
563405,Guest,2007-02-15 15:26:00,0,what do coffee grounds do to crawlers?
563406,2746,2007-02-15 15:37:00,3206,They eat coffee grounds.
563407,Mohleye,2007-02-15 15:38:00,368,"The worms supposedly eat them. I was going to add, a styrofoam container like the Omaha Steaks come in has worked really well for us to transport our crawlers. Duct tape or bungee it shut. The newspaper idea is good, I use a frozen bottle of water. The idea is to keep them cool without getting the bedding too wet. The worms will drown if the bedding is too wet."
563409,Guest,2007-02-15 19:25:00,0,"We have our crawlers in Buss Bedding and that is what we tell the Canadian Custom person when they ask and we never have had them check them. We take 2 flats of crawlers, put them into an old Coleman Cooler almost full of Buss bedding. We have 2 frozen 1/2 gal jugs filled with water which we keep in the tray on top. At camp we have another set of ce jugs so we keep rotating the jugs to always have solid ice in the cooler. Crawlers have always been in great shape doing this. Fritz"
563436,Guest,2007-02-17 08:46:00,0,"why don't you guy's just get the camp owner to get a flat for you, so they will be ready for you when you get there, then you won't have to deal with them while travelling."
