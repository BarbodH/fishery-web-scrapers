563439,Trailerguy,2007-02-17 18:38:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Our local dealer for Snapper lawnmowers, is the only factory authorized dealer to service Snappers for 75 to 100 miles around. He and his mechanics spend days going to seminars and to the factory for training every winter. That costs him money and time to sell the Snapper brand. There are a number of other Snapper dealers in the area, one is even here in town. When you buy a Snapper from the other guy and get a good deal that's fine. Until you want warrenty service. Then you have to go to a dealer autherized to service Snappers. He makes no bones about it, you buy from him and your machine goes to the front of the line. You buy from somebody else you go to the back of the line, and slide back every time one of his customers bring their machine in. Three weeks later he may have time to work on your machine. Do you see a paralel here? How good is the that deal across the border? Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"

563446,AMPHIB206,2007-02-18 11:41:00,191,"I think there is another issue here as well. Here is a parallel issue with ATV's. I can drive across the border from Manitoba to Lancaster MN and buy a Polaris ATV for $2500 cheaper than I can buy the exact same ATV 40 miles north of the border at a Polaris dealership. I heard that Canadian ATV dealers will not honor warranty work on NEW ATV's that were purchased in the States and imported. The problem is with Polaris; they have not adjusted their prices since the Canadian dollar got a lot stronger. To help the Canadian dealers out, I heard that any NEW Polaris ATV that shows up at a Canadian dealership for warranty work---the American dealer that sold the quad has to take a similar ATV off the floor of the Canadian dealer. This is to make it a more level playing field. I can empathize with the all Canadian dealers in regards to it not being a level playing field. But most people with go where the deals are; but what out for any repercussions........ This goes for boats, snowmobiles and ATV's. I imported 2 ATV's last year from MN; flipped them for an easy profit. That is when I found out this information regarding new ATV's. CYAV"
563451,Guest,2007-02-18 14:59:00,0,"You said the cd was stronger so the canadian dealer should be able to buy for better price or at least less c dollar,, but they dont want to pass the savings down the line,, so can u blame someone to look around ,seems to me some dealers are doing this to themselfs,, if u can buy the same atv 2500.00 cheaper a little ways away"
563457,Guest,2007-02-19 10:09:00,0,"The worm has turned. For the past decade, Americans from border states have been going to Canada to buy ATVs, Boats, Campers, etc to save money due to the exchange rate. They had their share of warranty ""situations"". Now it is the other way around. On warranties, some (particularly Japanese imports) outboards, ATVs, etc., have warranty specific to the country it was sold in. As to the original poster, it depends on the engine brand, as to if the dealer will be authorized (meaning he will get paid) to do warranty work on a boat motor). The boat portion of the equation should not be a problem. We have done warranty work on our brand of boats purchased in Canada. We have no problems with some brands , yet it is impossible to get authorization with other brands of outboards, (brands we sell)however."
