563632,VMS,2007-02-24 20:05:00,1103,"Hi everyone, Possibly have a trip headed there for northerns and walleyes in mid June and our crew of 12+ usually likes to camp on an island. Already know about the permit stuff so no need to mention that, but this is somewhat short notice for this trip, and I don't want to have to spend a bunch of time running around looking for a suitable site for 3 - 4 boats and equipment... Anyone willing to help me out on this? Also, how bad is the bear situation? thanks Steve"
563636,rockpt,2007-02-25 13:17:00,589,There's a nice sheltered bay with sand beach on the NE side of Comegan Island. Would appear to have enough room for your party. I've also heard of guys camping on Horseshoe Island in Miles Bay.
563639,esgrams,2007-02-25 17:08:00,92,"There's a super nice island that we have camped on numerous times in the mouth of Stoney Bay, but that might be a longer run than you want to make.. Let me know if you want more info.. Eric"
563641,VMS,2007-02-25 18:08:00,1103,"I go up there in July for muskies, but this trip would be for Northerns and walleyes. so...we would want the walleyes more than anything... and some fun catching northerns. It will not be like northern manitoba, but it would be nice to have some decent fishing for them... running a ways is not too much of an issue since where we have been going was a 17 mile trip one way on water... Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks Steve"
563642,rpieske,2007-02-25 18:13:00,1276,Steve: There is a suitable island just East of Round Island that is frequently used by the Boy Scouts and other canoe trippers. I don't have my maps available tonight but email me and I'll send you the coordinates of that and perhaps an additional spot.
563643,esgrams,2007-02-25 18:46:00,92,"Steve-Round Island as Bob metioned is going to be alot closer for you than Stoney--but looking at the map, right in the mouth of the bay there is a sizeable island smack dab in the middle--The camping island is the next one to the East--Sorry don't have a very good map with all the coordinates available-Must be in the boat-- Camping island has three different spots to set up on depending on your likes and dislikes in a camping spot--We always chose the one with the most wind( depending on the time of year we go) for the mosquito issue.. Regarding your bear question, We've never had a problem, but that doesn't mean anything I guess, were not even that careful about our food storage or putting anything up in a tree out of reach during the day when were out fishing"
563644,Bill Krejca,2007-02-25 19:21:00,6107,"We used to camp on an island just in to Obabikon Lake. It is beautiful there, however, if the water is low, you may have more adventure than you want. Let me know if you want more details."
563661,VMS,2007-02-26 20:18:00,1103,"Hi Everyone, I am very familiar with the Round Island area.. There are two islands directly East of Round. The one to the south has a couple of cottages on it (west side and south side), the one to the north is a little smaller. They are connected by a weedy and very shallow saddle. I would assume it is the island to the north? What side of the island? Also, around horseshoe Island, is the camping spot in the big bay on the east side? Sandy, rocky, etc? Thanks for all the help so far...it's been really great!! Steve"
563664,rockpt,2007-02-27 10:33:00,589,"On Horseshoe in Miles Bay, the east side is rocky and lots of shallow submerged rocks all over the east side of the island. Pretty tricky getting in and out of there. I think guys camp on the SW or NW sides. Deeper bays and more suitable for camping."
