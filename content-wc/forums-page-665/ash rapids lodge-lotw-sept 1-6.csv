The walleye are plentiful on the reefs, often stacked up in small areas. I love fall fishing in that area of the lake, would you consider later in the fall? say end of september?"

I will mention here on the board that it is a great facility, fantastic fishing, and Sept is and ideal time to go. The fish at this time of the year are getting ready for winter so to speak, they are for the better part much larger than that of summer fishing, and less lake traffic.

563399,Guest,2007-02-15 10:26:00,0,"Yes,I did forget to mention the meals are great. they have a chef not just a cook. There is a diff. in my eyes. Their guides are highly experienced too I might add. I no longer guide myself. Retired but fishing/guiding in that area of LOTW of one of the greatest experiences in my life. You will certainly have a great time. Ron"
563401,Guest,2007-02-15 10:33:00,0,"Location: Ash Rapids is located in Ash Bay at the entrance to Shoal Lake Narrows, giving you accesses to Shoal Lake. Once you enter into the rapids (minor ones) you will be in an area that is primarily sheltered with hundred of bays and inlets. Submerged weed lines for pike and muskies plus many reefs also. I suggest a map or GPS. Shoal Lake itself is not charted. No matter what the wind direction you will find a place to fish. Not saying that would be the right place as I personally always fished the windy side of whatever bay. Worked for me. Bass fishing is astronoical. Pike fishing can be great with catches in the 10 and up bracket. Muskie fishing can commence at the island right in front of the lodge, and you can hit every island going down shoal Lake Narrows actually and might get nailed by one. Lake trout is available in two areas not far from the Lodge. Cul-de-Sac, Echo Bay, and Clearwater Bay. Catches range from 10 to 30lbs. at times. I have a zillion photo's here of my days guiding their. Some just to old to put on their www site and hopefully myself I will be out their for opening for a visit. Poor health stops guiding or much else now. But still visit now and then Have a great time"

563411,Guest,2007-02-15 20:53:00,0,"With the size of LOTW, who ""really"" knows the hottest places. To me catching the smallmouth in the numbers I caught, the pike in well over the 15lb bracket at times, and muskie in up to three a day was good enough for me without running around the lake. I do wish though I had taken the time to venture around more. but I know from Shoal Lake to Kenora, down around Crow Rock, Wiley, Bishop Pt, and remember a bit of Long Bay from my guiding days in that area. Also had a personal trip to Sabaskong, but primarily watched. It's a great lake no matter what anyone says once you find your way around."
