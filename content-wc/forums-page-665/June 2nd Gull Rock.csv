Very good year last year. I think it's good that they shut the sanctuaries for a bit longer. Makes no difference really..I've been fishing opening weekend for years and we've always done well outside the sanctuaries. The mouth of the rivers hold nice fish in the spring ....Happy fishing.

563414,sifty,2007-02-16 07:31:00,46,Going to Gullrock in june this year. We normally go in september. I'm sure that there is big difference as to were the fish are. Any tips on the hot spots for June? What baits work best? How deep are they? Any help would be appreciated thanks.
563416,Guest,2007-02-16 08:21:00,0,"Well you know they spawn in spring. Follow them out from spawning sites especially if there is a stream or river coming into the bay. Walleye will not be shallow at this time of year, I never fish deeper the 10-12 ft. Unless your trying to get the post spawn females, then fish deeper. I like to start at mouth of bay and drive boat in until I find the first site of weeds and fish there first. If you like to know more please email me [email protected]"
563417,grt1,2007-02-16 08:23:00,259,"On june2 you will find almost every camp boat in Ranger or the bay coming out of it. last year my neighbour counted 70 boats in Ranger lake, not one was a local. most were jigging or lindy rigging."
563420,sifty,2007-02-16 09:34:00,46,Sounds like it might be bumper boats if there is that many. Grt1 are you saying thats the only place to catch them that time of year? How about the Northern bite? I was alwys under the impression that ranger was off limits and you were not allowed to fish up there. Do they open that only in the spring?
563421,2746,2007-02-16 09:52:00,3206,"It's a herd mentality at ranger. Someone catches fish, the word spreads and everyone goes there. It is bumper boats and not my ""cup of tea"". Harvey hit it right.....follow the lake out of ranger and start hitting the weeds or points as you go back west. Same thing will be true for the mouth of the river running into Keg. Unless it's an awfully late spring the fish will be moving off the spawn beds and into the main lake. They'll likely be a bit more scattered than your used to seeing in the summer and fall but they will be there."
563423,grt1,2007-02-16 10:07:00,259,There was supposed to be an extension of the sanctuary time limit to the 15th of June that was to start in 2007 but as far as I know the new regulations for this year have not been accepted by the federal fisheries department. I am going to check on this and will post my findings later. If the sanctuary extensions are in place you can expect to find the boats at the river mouth where it enters Gullrock.
563424,Guest,2007-02-16 10:35:00,0,"There's more than just one area in Gullrock... Kegs a great producer for monster walleye in the spring. Just follow the river, markers at the mouth of Keg do very well in June. Try Bug river one day. Sometimes they run through there in the Spring. The locals like doing a little shore fishing along Bug... Also if your adventurous try McNeilly Bay in the evening or head up to Upper Chukuni for a slotter fest. 50 walleye an hour anytime of the day....Nice eaters and monster walleye in the morn and eve ...... Try Post Narrows.... and there's also my secret spot under that big old rock....hehehe Enjoy.. Guaranteed in all those spots... More Info [email protected] love to here from yas.... Mista W"

563427,grt1,2007-02-16 12:52:00,259,I checked with the MNR and they confirm that the sanctuaries will be closed until June 15th. They said the regulations haven't been approved as yet but they expect them to be in place by opening day.
563430,Guest,2007-02-16 13:31:00,0,Correct me if I'm wrong but that means you won't be able to fish ranger? Thanks for all the tips guys. Looks like I will be fishing unchartered water for myself up there. We never hardly left the clay banks last sept. Looks like we will be covering more water this year. Were staying at Procyck's this time only place we could find rooms at. Guess that should tell me that there is going to be alot of boats on the water. Not my cup of tea so I will try those different locations. Thanks.
