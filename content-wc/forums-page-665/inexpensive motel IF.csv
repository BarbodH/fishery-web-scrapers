This happened to us two years ago and we got stung to the tune of $95(American) a room on a Wednesday night. Ouch, I still feel that one and cuss the idiot in our group who inked the deal with the gal working the front desk while we dug our crap out of the boats in the parking lot."
563388,Guest,2007-02-14 14:28:00,0,I called the Holiday Inn and they gave me a rate of $99.00/night which I thought was a little pricey for the Falls.
563470,FISHNBOWLJOE,2007-02-19 23:20:00,80,We stayed at the Vermillion campground/hotel. It's about 20 miles east of Orr MN. If I remember correctly it was only $59.00 a night. I know it's pretty far away from IF but it was cheap and clean. Joe
563516,Guest,2007-02-22 06:59:00,0,"we also have stayed at the Super 8 in FF...had been staying at the Red Dog Inn but a few years back they were closed for remodeling..so we switched to the Super 8..while at our resort, we decide what week we will be going up for the following week and stop in and book it on our way back..for whatever reason we are staying at the Emo Inn this year..dont know if anyone has ever stayed there but some feedback on it would be appreciated"
563542,Guest,2007-02-23 03:37:00,0,"I have been going to Canada once or twice a year since 1978 and we almost always stay at the Days Inn. The Days Inn is clean and quiet. If you ask for a room on the parking lot side you can look out the window and check on your rig. The rates are about $62/night and they are next door to a nice restaurant. I can't think of the name off hand. Moose something or other. The super 8 (next to days inn) is also inexpensive, but there beds are not that comfy. I guess you get what you pay for. I have stayed at the American Inn in Orr and it is real nice, but won't be in your price range if you are looking for rates similar to the Days Inn or Super 8. I have also stayed at the Holiday Inn. $99/night sounds right. You are paying extra because they have a pool,restaurant and bar. Brent"

563323,Guest,2007-02-12 07:51:00,0,Can anyone recommend an inexpesive but clean motel in IF that has plenty of room for rigs towing a boat?

563326,Guest,2007-02-12 09:40:00,0,Super8 is a nice place I think it is next door to the Days Inn but I do know Super8 has plenty of parking and the rates were not too bad for I Falls. I think a room for 2 was $59.00 in Aug.
563327,Guest,2007-02-12 09:45:00,0,We have friends that stay at the Days Inn there. Have for years. Never had a problem. But be careful if you stay in town. There has been a lot of vandalism and theft at other places. The Holiday Inn west of I-Falls about a mile or so out of the business district and which usually did not have a problem even went as far as hiring a night watchman. The guests still woke up one morning with tires slashed in the parking lot. We are going to stay in the Super 8 in Fort Frances. That way not only do we avoid the I-Falls vandalism problem (which may or may NOT have gone away depending on who you talk to) but we also get to cross the border about 6 P.M. after all the other fishermen have gone through for the day and before the big rush the next morning. This is our first year trying it. We will see how it goes. In prior years we always stopped in motels in the U.S. short of I-Falls because of the vandalism issue.
563328,Guest,2007-02-12 09:57:00,0,"I did hear at one time about people tearing up things and cutting tires in I Falls. I have had that problem in other places in Minnesota, with your truck boat and fishing tackle. Are the knuckleheads that bored up there?"
563352,Rich J,2007-02-12 19:54:00,65,"We stay at the Tee Pee Motel which is on the highway and is in town. We have never had a problem with vandalism and have never heard of anyone else staying there having a problem. Not saying it can't happen, we will be staying there again this year. Clean motel with reasonable rates, Shore Lunch Cafe next door is excellent for breakfast. Early morning it is packed with fishermen, later around 8:00 the locals show up. Rich J"
563353,Guest,2007-02-12 20:41:00,0,"We stay at the Super 8 in Fort Francis as well. Crossing the border the evening before is much easier than in the morning. The Super 8 is very nice, big parking lot, well lighted, free breakfast in the morning and when the exchange rate was better several years ago they darn near paid you to stay. Now it's about $60-$70."
563355,Guest,2007-02-13 06:45:00,0,"For several years we stays in IF with no problems. The last couple of years we stay at the AmericInn in Orr MN. Traveling with kids so they like the place because of the pool with the water slide. Great place, very clean, nicely run with nice view of Pelican Lake. They offer a continental breakfast as well. 4 months and counting... IA Walleye"

563381,Guest,2007-02-14 04:36:00,0,We stay at the falls motel. Sort of a dive but clean and enough boat parking and no vandalism that I am aware of. Usually 60-75$ depending on the time of year. They do have rooms with 3 beds. Sort of a tradition to stay at the falls. eric
