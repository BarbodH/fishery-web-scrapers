563558,Roddy,2007-02-23 11:58:00,488,Are non DI two strokes still being sold in Canada. We do a fly-in trip every other year. On our last trip in 2005 I thought I heard that 2 strokes were being phased out in the next year. The resort we go to had been using 9.9 2 strokes that never seem to idle smoothly and give off lots of fumes. We were hoping they would have to go to four strokes this year

The problem lodge owners have been faced with is that all of the kinks have not been worked out of the four strokes and they are reluctant to make a big investment in problem motors."

563630,Greg @ ABL,2007-02-24 17:20:00,23,"The dealer I dealt with last year could not get Yamaha 2 strokes the second half of last year. Evinrude has plans to make the E-tec in the lower horsepower motors... but that likely is a couple years away yet. I purchased my first Yamaha 4 strokes last year. I honestly prefer the 2 strokes. In my case they seem to start better, and I thought they ran smoother. I also use some 4 hp motors on smaller lakes, and the 4 strokes are a hassle with concerns over which way they are laid on the ground. There are just more parts to cause problems with the 4 stroke. Also they do not troll as slow as a 2 stroke. All the best, Greg Bolinski Agate Bay Lodgewww.agatebaylodge.com NPAA #944"

I can't see our 9.9 crapping out in my lifetime, but if it does I would have no problem replacing with a 4 stroke. I love that Yamaha. And once our big mec craps out it will get a 4 stroke"
