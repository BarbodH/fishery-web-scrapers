I have tried all numbers on the website and all are disconnected! Talked to Swensons Resort (Recently closed for good) owners and they thought it had been sold and didn't have the number for the new owners. (although she had numbers for all other resorts in the area) Can anyone tell me the status of Hidden Island Resort and how to get in touch with the new owners? Thanks in advance, Marv"

I dont know the names of the people, but it's hard to believe all the local numbers for the resort would be disconnected. That would be a bad way to start a new season. Good luck getting in touch."
