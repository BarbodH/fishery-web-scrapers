563544,OntarioAngler,2007-02-23 06:48:00,46,"I've been to only three different Bass Pros. Toronto, Auburn Hills and Orlando. The best one I've been to is Auburn Hills. The worst by far is Toronto. They have a ton of kids (and adults) working there that don't have a clue about fishing. I live 3 hours from Toronto and am Canadian. I would rather drive over the border at $4 a pop, pay the exchange and possible duty to buy at Auburn Hills, then even step foot in that store in Toronto. Dont waste your time. Just my two cents."

Seems to have a lot of clothing,want nots gift type items, fishing and hunting is just a small part. I guess a lot of people want to dress and look like a hunter or fisherman. Springfield,Mo is the really the big store, but a long ways from Canada. But still a nice place to see."

563624,Guest,2007-02-24 02:04:00,0,Well the Toronto store is the only Bass Pro store that I have been in. So I really do not have anything to compare it with execpt the local stores. I do know that I could go in there stark naked with a credit card and leave with everything I need for the next year except the cottage. Is it really posable for a store to have every lure of very color from every maker. Seems to me it would be one massive store with alot of wasted space. Dave

Last X'mas I went to Auburn BPS and found that they are the same. Well maybe carried more stuffs than BPS Canada but a lot of their stuffs are either ""Not here yet"" or Catalog order ""Only"". I was there trying to get ""LOTS"" of soft plastic but only to find out that, the most they have is 5 bags of each color/model. If 4 sold, the computer system will not Automatically stock it up till the last one is sold. And when its all sold, another 5 will come. FIVE????? Come on>??????:arse: Well, maybe I will never be a good Businessman......I don't know....my cheap 2 cents:-)"
563537,Topwater,2007-02-22 21:22:00,484,I'm looking for some comments on the bass pro shop store in Toronto. I'm going to Montreal in Sept on a muskie trip and was wondering if I should schedule a half day layover in toronto to check this place out. I'm flying out from Alberta and have never been to one of these mega outdoor stores like bass pro or cabelas. questions How far is store from airport? (cab ride) How are they pricing merchandise as far as the catalog goes and exchange rates go? Is there alot of walleye stuff or is it mostly bass stuff? Any hotels at the airport? I've emailed the store manager a few times with no responce so any and all comments are appreiciated:thanks2:

The Store is about 25-35 minutes from the Airport with traffic not jam up. As for pricing, give me the Product number and I will get you the price for your comparison to BPS USA. They have stuffs for both Walleye and Bass, but they don't carry most of the Rods that they have in BPS USA. Even some of the Lures, they either don't have it here or don't have certain color. Yes I think its a Sheraton at the Airport, might be wrong."

As for scecific pricing, I dont have any thing in mind. Just wondering how they price stuff in general, Its obviously not gonna be priced in u.s. funds. Do they convert the exchange rates or just price for what the market can bear."

US$3.19 Vs C$4.27http://www.basspro.com/servlet/catal...rTarget=browse Been to Auburn BPS and tax is 8% and its 14% in Toronto. You do the Math :-) before Shipping that is :popcorn: http://www.basspro.com/servlet/catal...rTarget=browse US$4.99 Vs C$7.99 If my number is right seem like most stuff I need are cheaper in the US.
