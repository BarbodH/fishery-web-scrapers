563452,tjsker,2007-02-18 22:36:00,301,"What structure do the walleye mostly relate to around that time of year? Underwater structure? Saddles between islands? Dropoffs next to deep water? Also, has anyone marked walleye on a locator while on your way to a spot?"
563453,Guest,2007-02-19 07:14:00,0,End of June normally finds the Lac Seul Walleye in the middle part of their transistion to main lake ares. We concentrate on drop offs in the 10' to 15'depth and try to cover lots of water with bottom bouncers or dragging cranks. Once we locate fish we jig/minnow the area. Walleye will be found in shallower water if there is a good wind with cloud cover. In those situations we fish windy points and saddles with jigs.Generally spots that the wind will group baitfish on by pushing them into the shallower water (4'to10'). The Walleye also relate well to weed bed edges that time of year because they are starting to appear and can hold bait fish. Slip bobbers and jig/minnow are good presentations. Lac Seul is an awesome fishery and end of June fish are easily located by working a variety of structure like I have mentioned. I believe that during this period the wind is the most imprtant issue in finding schooled fish. Find a windy point or saddle and fish hard and slow. You will catch fish. Remember light of a jig as you need to get to the bottom and keep the slack out of your line when you drop the jig down so you can feel the bite better. I'm sure others have ideas too and I would love to hear from you. Especially NWO Fishing Bum.

563494,tlars,2007-02-20 18:47:00,137,"Well now boys and girls, isn't it more fun to play nice!!!!! For those of us in north central Iowa, this board is a great distraction from winter. It' been too much like Ontario here - 18 out of 19 days below zero for a low. Cabin fever sets in and stays!!! At my advanced age (58) I just don't enjoy sitting around with the guys and drinking like I used to. So, I lurk around here. Destroyer, I've fished the mega sand structure (maybe with you?) in the fall out of SWWL. What an experience! I can relate exactly to what you're saying about the boat length or two off the first break. A lot of little ones on top, neutral fish deeper with the active fish in between. Unfortunately last fall, I managed to catch a 90 hp Yammie - haven't done that since I was about 12. Oh well, keep up the chatter. 95 days but who's counting? Lars out."
