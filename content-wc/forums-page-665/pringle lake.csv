563567,mikenewpal,2007-02-23 17:25:00,7,"Hi OT. I was with Mattice in 2005. I however fished Weese Lake and it was in late August. Caught lots of eyes, and some good ones, largest was around 28"". Walleye in morning and evening were schooled and hanging shallow (less than 5 ft of water!)and around any islands we found. At times it was fish literally every cast. However, during the day...a different story. Eyes were deep and spotty. On windy days during the day we fished the traditional wind-blown points etc, and did well, as it moved them back up shallow and the rougher water deflected the light so much better. We used jigs and crawlers, and that was all you needed. Pike were tough, and we knew that we were not in prime time Pike season at Weese, as they were deep and hard to come by with any consistency. Largest was around 12lbs. In September on any of Don and Annettes lakes I believe you will take a ton more, and larger pike. They will be feeding heavily and be back somewhat shallower as the water cools down. At that time, larger baits will do well like Suicks, large Bucktails etc., as they will be looking for big meals to fatten up. Not sure if you have been with Mattice before, but they are the best people to deal with, they have first rate cabins and equipment and unmatched service. Hope this helps a little. Mike"

While the patterns would certainly be different, I'd be glad to mark up some maps for you or answer any specific questions I can. Feel free to email me at [email protected] and I'd be happy to discuss Pringle with you. Great lake, but there are some very specific areas you need to focus on."

I was trying to respond, but clicked the wrong button, that's what you get for drinking Appleton rum before checking your emails ;-) Shoot me another one and I'll send you my snail mail address, I'll gladly mark up some maps. Sorry. [email protected]"
