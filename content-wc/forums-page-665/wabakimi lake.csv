563364,thunderatwork,2007-02-13 10:30:00,79,"anyone have any reports on wabakimi lake. We have booked thru rusty myers for aug. Myself, another dad and our two teenage sons are going up to slay walleyes. we went to granite lake last year,first time to canada for the other three. we had a blast. we don't know anything about wabakimi lake other than it is big and fit our schedules. we liked rusty's way of doing business. So we know that part is covered. If anyone wants i have reports/tips on granite, mountairy, metongia, bamji, and older report for lount(english river)."

563527,Rat,2007-02-22 14:43:00,102,Went up there 35 years ago. Fishing was great. It can be a little challenging since its so big. I recall huge pike and tons of walleyes. Our best areas were where the rivers came in.
