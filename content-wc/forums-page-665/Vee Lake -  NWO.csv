Looking at the picture, It looks like a very interesting lake, the cabin is on a island. The outfitter is Amik fly-in outposts. Thanks, JDLane:rockit:"

Has a great fire pit out front. As I remember the fishing was on reefs (late july) during the day. In the evening we were able to catch them in shallow and above weed beds using rapalas. Bring plenty of plastics as you will be on your own. A portable depth finder would be of great help. Best of luck"

563422,Guest,2007-02-16 10:06:00,0,"We were at Vee lake Aug of 2006. The Lake was decent but could have been better. It might have been the weather, very windy. On a good day we caught 50 walleye a day. On a bad day 20. We mailnly fish walleye and ended up catching 6 northerns over 36 with the digest at 40. Largest walleye was 27.5 caught trolling in front of the cabin. The cabin was ok but very small sleeping quarters. You can amuse yourself for an hour by reading the 50 signs they have posted around the camp telling you what to do and not to do. Reminded me of the song :Signs, signs everwhere a sign , you will see. The screened in porch would have been a nice place to sleep to avoid the close quarter snoring but there was a bear in camp for most of the week. The worst part of the trip was the outfitters, not the pilot, but his wife and the father. We new we were going to be overweight so we called ahead and confirmed that we could pay $1.25lb extra and were told it would be ok. When we got there we were scolded by them for being overweight. The problem lies in that the would not fly the beer in ahead of time (like most other outfitters) so it put a huge dent in what the plane could hold. They do not make mid week flight checks so the could not bring in the overflow mid week. On the way out they did not even say thank you (for spending $7000. with them). We would not fly with NOW again but would entertain going to one of the lakes in the area but not with them."

I can understand their logic with the weight, seeing some of the groups luggage they packed for a week in the bush, you would think they were going on a six month vacation! Our group was very happy with the service and wouldnt think twice about going back. kw"
563443,Fishful Thinker,2007-02-18 06:58:00,100,"Jig and a Spoon, you have to realise that aircraft are regulated as to how much weight they can carry. Most airways aren't going to say anything if you are a few pounds over with your gear, but if they were flying an overload and something should happen, I'm sure you can figure out the rest."
563444,Guest,2007-02-18 07:34:00,0,"You guys are missing the point, he called ahead to make sure they could fly in the overload for the $1.25 per pound. If that is the charge for extra weight, why get upset about them being overweight? They were planning to pay for it. I think that is more what the problem is."
563454,Guest,2007-02-19 08:24:00,0,"Exactly the point. They said we could pay for extra weight and the said they would fly beer and soda in AHEAD of time. We get there and we find our beer and soda on the dock. That was 400+ lbs of weight that was not suppose to be on our plane. Again the problem was the no weekly check flights. If they would routinly do those then no issue what so ever. Fly the extra in haead of time or mid week. Either way issue solved. I agree John, the pilot was very nice and friendly. His wif has zero people skills and the father was right up there too."
