Regards, Scott Lee Since there is six times as much water as dry land on earth, any fool can plainly see the good Lord meant for man to fish six times as much as he works."

Are you planning a trip? I have a map that is a scanned map of the lake from one of Wayne's maps. I found a guy online that goes up every year and he sent it to me. Leave your e-mail and I will try and forward it. Quality is so so, but it will give some idea of the lake(s). Joe"
563487,Guest,2007-02-20 12:02:00,0,Yeah really no good map of the lake exists. I will be there early June this year.
563491,ScottL,2007-02-20 14:32:00,733,"I was afraid of that(no really good map). I have a copy of the map that Dogtooth Lake Resort has. I was hoping for something more. I'm going to see what I can make with google earth and other sources. Thanks for the help and any additional help would be great. Regards, Scott Lee Since there is six times as much water as dry land on earth, any fool can plainly see the good Lord meant for man to fish six times as much as he works."
