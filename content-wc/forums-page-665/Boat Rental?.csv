I go to Lac Seul Chamberlain narrows, where the camp boats are expensive, but ok. It would be great if I could rent a 17 or 18 foot boat with a 50-70 HP motor locally and tow it myself. You can rent cars, trailers, vans, etc..... boats?? Since I only fish about 1x per year and live in a city, it isn't really practical for me to buy a boat, but it sure would be great to rent one every once in a while."
