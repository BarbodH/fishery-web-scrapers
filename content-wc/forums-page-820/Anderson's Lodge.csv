After 40 plus years of various trips, the old geezer & planner of our group has finally succumbed to overwhelming demand to step up. No more 20 plus hour straight thru drives hauling all boats and gear, cooking all your meals, doing all your dishes, packing soggy ham sandwiches, or worse, for lunch a week straight, etc. But now we have some questions: 1) How much to tip the various staff? 2) Without getting into the whole beer in the boat debate, what is their policy on taking beer in the boat, I know staff is not allowed to drink at all, (quite a change from Joe, up in the Ear Falls area)? 3) What and where is biting best and where around the first of July, ie where will the guides take us? (Not that it matters or we care, since we don't have to find the fish!) 4) Food sounds great, but how is it really? 5) How much is a beer in the lounge? Sorry if it seems most my questions relate to beer, but Canadian beer is a fine thing! Any other inside info would be appreciated."
