539012,Guest,2004-04-20 14:23:00,0,"I have received outstanding service from Excellent Adventures and the facilities/equipment are fine. Have not used Wilderness North so can not make a comparison. Sumach is the only lake I've flow into with Excellent Adventures. Caught some decent-sized northerns without targeting them on each trip. It's primarily a walleye lake, with a good population of smallies and lake trout."
539033,Guest,2004-04-21 08:00:00,0,"We will be fishing with Excellent Adventures for the 3rd time this year. We have had a great time the past two years and expect more of the same this year. Joyce and Faron are great hosts and the staff is very freindly and helpful. Hailstone Lake has a large quantity of Walleye in the 13""-21"" range and the largest Pike last year was 42"". The cabin is a little older, but works just fine and the boats and motors are in great shape. We will be trying Papaonga Lake this year just to change things up a little."
539064,Guest,2004-04-22 19:24:00,0,I went to one of Wilderness North's outposts last year (the camp at Mojikit channel). Their service and facilities are the best I have ever seen in their price range. I have been going to Canada at least once per year for 25 years. I would highly recommend them. I am going back again this year.
