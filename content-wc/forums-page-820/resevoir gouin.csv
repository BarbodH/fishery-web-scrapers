539103,Guest,2004-04-25 22:34:00,0,our group is thinking on taking a trip to resevoir gouin in quebec.does anyone have any websites of fishing resorts there? also how many hours does it take to drive there from chicago. thank you.
539105,McQ,2004-04-26 04:50:00,615,"tombo, there are listings for Gouin Reservoir Outfitters in the Business Directory here on Walleye Central. Just look at the index links at the top of the forum page. It's a good 12 hour drive from Chicago to Ottawa, then another 4 1/2 to 6 hours into the Gouin depending on the area you select. Tony Puccio drove up from Madison WI a few years back to fish with me and it took him about 15 hours if I remember correctly. We did fly into the lodge we were fishing out of though."
539109,retire55,2004-04-26 10:18:00,1029,"tombo: While McQ has directed you to some great outfitters, those advertising in the business directory represent but a few of the more than 25 outfitters plying their trade on the Gouin Reservoir. For a more complete list see http://www.mrchsm.org/index_ang.html"
539145,Andre M,2004-04-27 20:26:00,86,"WC is such a great site, I think we must push on the outfitters that are ready to invest their money on promotion on WC before anybody else. The directory is a super tool for that. If we want WC to be the ""web-site"" we should put our focus on the one that are ready to invest their money on that site."
539152,retire55,2004-04-28 08:28:00,1029,"Andre M: I concur completely with your sentiment that walleyecentral.com is a great site. Fundamental to it being such a great site, IMHO, is Scotts willingness to provide a place where folks can share information, help others, and/or seek information. Consequently, my agenda does not include limiting any outfitter information (I might be able to provide) to WC sponsors. To do so would jeopardize the grass roots strength of this site."
539174,Atlanta Dave,2004-04-28 18:08:00,323,MQ Do you have any motels you have used or know of in Parent.? Also are there any motels on the gravel road to Parent? Atlanta Dave

539187,Guest,2004-04-29 06:39:00,0,"I don't have any interest in any of the above hotel and motel but....I strongly recommand the quatre season ""four season"" is a more reliable place As for the Gouin situation as of today april 29th the Gouin is still iced over and warm weather is in the forecast this week end. The water level is at 403 meters asl. Last year the water level was 399 meters asl, a very big difference 4 meters is more than 12 feets. To check the weather at the Gouin reservoir here is the address, click on imperial measure to have them in farenheit.http://weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/foreca...y_e.html?QC-A1"
