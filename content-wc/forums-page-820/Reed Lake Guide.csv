I have been going to Iskwasum for 4 yrs and love it but would like a change. The seven guys (5 -Regina, 1-Ft. Mac and 1-Morden) I fish with, have been going to Iskwasum for over ten years. Any one know of a good guide that is reasonable, and would not mind us using a GPS to mark the hazards. We are mostly interested in Eyes but would like to try jigging for Lakers (not set up for down rigging). We talk to guys who come over from Reed Lake each year, there appears to be bigger fish in Reed. We have no trouble finding fish in Iskwasum, however it is difficult to find the bigger ones. The last big one a 30`` and was two years ago, however lots of 22``"

I am sure you are running a GPS, so I can give our spots. There are not many hazards in Iskswaum unless you plan on going up to the north end or across to Loucks Lake. We normally do not fish in Loucks, however last June the bigger Eyes where in there, but due to the low water levels so where the rocks. One of the guys in our group took off his prop. We usally spend a afternoon down at the falls, have a shore lunch and fish the Grassy River. Bert"
