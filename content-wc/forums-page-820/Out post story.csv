Last year we took a Fly-out 80 miles North of Ear Falls, we were the only people on the lake. Getting immediate medical care would be out of the question. ( This will have importance later in the story ) 7 guys which included my 74 year old Dad, my Uncle, my Brother, and 3 buddies. This trip was the last fishing trip I had with my Dad. And I knew it would be, before we left. Dad died of Lung Cancer in March of this year. This is why my Brother and Uncle were with. Typically it was just Dad and I, with my buddies. Anyhoo, the trip had a lot of emotion built into it as we knew it was the last trip with my Dad. And because of this, there was probably more alcohol consumed than normal. Which was O.K. until one night. My Uncle is famous for drinking Black Russians and this night he been making them a wee bit stiff. Prior to dinner he had slurred his opinion to my choice of steaks which I had brought and the fact they were going to be tough. And the only way they were going to be enjoyable, was to tenderize them. Which he proceeded to do with his bare hands. I let that slide, however I did grab and then hide my steak when he was pouring his next Black Russian. After dinner as I was washing up the dishes we were being lectured by my Uncle about such heady topics as "" Lousy Japanese Cars"" and "" Lousy German Engineering"" to which point I egged my Uncle on a bit and said, I was thinking about buying a small used B.M.W. for my wife. Which then pushed the lecture my way. At some point, my Uncle forgot that he had picked up the fillet knife that was on the table. My Uncle is an animated person. That is to say, he talks with his hands. Well he comes over to me to explain why the B.M.W. automobile is crap and to make his point he lunges his hand in the air. I felt the air from fillet knife on my neck, next to my jugular as I leaned back out of the way. What was a festive mood soon turned somber as I let loose with every swear word I could think of. The fact that I leaned out of the way, in my mind saved my life. Oh well, no one got hurt and I learned a valuable lesson. Pick up the cutlery when my Uncle wants to go on a rant. Ivy"

The outpost we go to didnt use to have a shower so we bathed in the lake. He was going to run down the dock and jump in the water. I told him that if he jumped off the dock and broke his leg on a stump that I was going to drag his idiot butt out of the water and leave him on the dock until Saturday...he was not going to ruin my fishing trip. Sadly enough he decided not to take a bath and has stunk every since. I guess I should have let him jump."
539266,lobo1,2004-05-02 18:56:00,734,We had a guy for ONE YEAR that was not much of an outdoorsman. He got in the sauce and for some reason wanted to argue about why the fish guts etc go to the rock across the lake and not in our trash. He babbled on about scattering the remains around our camp to see if he could get a chance to see the bears. I guess we all thought the fish had been dumped already but apparently not. This guy managed to stumble around camp and dump fish guts all over - we found them the next day. He wasn't invited back again. lobo1
