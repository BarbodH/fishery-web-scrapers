539118,MrBor,2004-04-26 20:58:00,5,I will be fishing in Minaki for the first time from Aug 7 - 14. How deep will I be fishing that time of year. Is this a Jig and minnow lake or bottom bouncers? Or what other lure do you suggest? Anyone have a good guide I should hire?
539124,Guest,2004-04-27 07:57:00,0,The crank bite it good that time of year. Troll around up on Big Sand in the evening. The walley follow the cisco schools around over the cool deep water that time of year......there are some big ones to be had doing that.
