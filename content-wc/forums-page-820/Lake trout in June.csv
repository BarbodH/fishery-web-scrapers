539168,Guest,2004-04-28 14:39:00,0,I have fished trout in early June. Trout usualy up in the top 40' and we could reach them with surface lures. This year we are going up in later June. Wondering what other methods to use? We have water as deep as 100 feet of water in the lake we fish.
539169,Trailerguy,2004-04-28 14:50:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Usually Lake Trout go down around the 10th of June depending on water temp. They are most comfortable in 48-52 degree water. By late June they maybe in 40-60' water around breaks and humps or on the bottum. Use a locator to spot some fish in a likely area. Try a large 6-8 oz weight on a 3-way and spoons with meat or large raps. Lower it to the bottum and bring it up 5' or so at a time, ripping it. Trolling with large weights can also be productive, but occasionaly giving it a rip will trigger the strike. This winter I bought a downrigger, so it'll be easier this year for me."
539193,Guest,2004-04-29 10:06:00,0,You may still be able to longline troll deepdiving crankbaits. The trout may be in 40-60 feet of water but they are probably suspended up of the bottom. They will chase the lures pretty far. You can also troll using dipsy divers or the like too. Towards the end of June or the beginning of July the trout should start schooling up. If you can find a school you can vertical jig for them. I like to use 5/8 oz sonars or 1/2 to 3/4 oz jigs tipped with a 4 inch white power tube. Jigging can lead to some increadibly fast action and is a ton of fun because you can use walleye gear. One tip with jigging is to rip the jigs HARD (like setting the hook hard) 3-5 feet. Start at the bottom and rip it 4-5 times then reel up a few feet and repeat. Works great. Absolut_zreo273

If you worry about visibility, you can add a mono leader with a double uni knot. Jigging in 100' of water with mono means lots of line stretch. So if you go to no stretch line, loosen that drag."
539205,Guest,2004-04-29 12:13:00,0,"I'm also planning on being up in June and possibly fishing for lake trout. If we do actually catch any, are there any precautions we should take in regard to pulling these fish out of deep water (rupturing air bladders, etc)? Will they live if we let them go?"
539206,Trailerguy,2004-04-29 12:38:00,1407,[font color=green size=3][b]Lake Trout have a vented swim bladder which allows them to survive rapid depth changes. When pulling one up from deep water you often see bubbles coming up as they near the surface. A minimum of handling insures survival.
