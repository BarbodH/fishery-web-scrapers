539086,Guest,2004-04-23 14:28:00,0,Looking for a cheap motel just north of the Twin Cites. We're leaving Friday night instead of Sat. am and would like to stay just north of the Cities off I-35. Any suggestions.
539087,Guest,2004-04-23 14:49:00,0,Drive straight through and have plenty of beer for the passengers. just kidding about the beer. We have driven straight through for 20 years and we have some of the best conversations at 3:00 in the morning. Have a great trip and be safe.
539104,Guest,2004-04-25 23:43:00,0,staying in the car would be the cheapest but coming from chicago our stop is at the black bear casino off 35 about 40 south of superior.
