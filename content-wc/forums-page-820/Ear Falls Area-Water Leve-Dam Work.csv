539032,Fisher,2004-04-21 06:48:00,35,"Does anyone know if the dam work that was supposed to be accomplished last year is going to happen this year in Ear Falls? Also, is there any indications as to what the water levels are projected to be this year in the area. I am really interested in the water level reports for the Woman River chain north of Ear Falls.

539095,Trailerguy,2004-04-23 20:02:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Looking at the historical graphs for Lac Suel, in/out flow, at WWW.lwcb/ca . The Out flow far exceeded in flow from November to February. I would suspect the water level is lower than last fall."

The inflow is now approx 400 CMS and the outflow is only 125 CMS. It looks like the level should return to normal for this spring on Lac Seul and other lakes in the area. Mother nature will ulitimately have the last say but it looks promising this year for more normal levels."

539112,Fisher,2004-04-26 12:40:00,35,Thanks for the replies. Keep any and all comments on this water level issue coming. We're keeping our fingers crossed on this one. The fishing last spring was tough with water levels as low as they were on the Woman River chain all the way up to Confederation. Couldn't get into many areas as in past years as a result of the levels. I've heard it was tough about everywhere in the Lac Suel water shed. Fisher
