539083,Guest,2004-04-23 13:18:00,0,We have spent most of our fishing time catching Crappie with two jigs on a pole. Can you fish two jigs in Ontario and if so how far apart should they be? Thanks

539094,Trailerguy,2004-04-23 19:48:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]From the 2004 Ontario fishing regulations: ""A fishing line must not have more than four hooks. Where an artificial lure is used, each double or treble hook attached to it is considered to be one hook. In all other situations, a double hook counts as two hooks, and a treble hook counts as three hooks."""
539096,Guest,2004-04-23 20:15:00,0,"We always use two hooks to fish crappies. Sometimes two jigs, but the real secret is to use a jig and a minnow up top and about three feet down on the end a jigging Rapalla which is an ice fishing jig. The jigging Rapalla has a number of hooks on it and with the jig might add up to four depending on how you count. We usually fish in Obabikon Lake or Miles Bay. The ice is just starting to go in the bay in front of Buena Vista."
