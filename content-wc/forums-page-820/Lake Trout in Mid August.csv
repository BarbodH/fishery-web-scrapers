539245,NavTech,2004-04-30 18:31:00,36,Fished Dog Lake (Missanabi Area) late last August and had a blast catching Lake trout. I was trolling Shad Raps 20 feet down from a slip diver which got us down to about 45 feet where the thermal was. Finding the thermal was the ticket. Find it and you'll find those feeding Lakers. Lakers are fun to catch but instead of eating them we use them for candles. Good heat source in winter too. Good Luck.

539260,Guest,2004-05-02 08:33:00,0,"There are a couple of approaches that work, with minimal gear. If you're marking them in less than 60 feet of water, and they're in clusters, try jigging for them. Fairly stout rod, baitcaster or spinning, 10 lb. plus line, mono works, and drop down a hair jig or jigging spoon tipped with meat. Sucker is best. Use very agressive snap and drops, starting at where you mark them, then raise it 5 feet every few minutes. Cabelas made/makes a great jigging lure called the Buzz Bombs. Lakers love them. If need be, add prism tape to them, to tweak them. Another trolling option is braided line with snap weights. I've used Power Pro, with snap weights, 3-6 oz. weights, and you can get down into the 40-60 foot range. Troll spoons and stick baits. If you're looking to get past 60', then you really need to think about the mini, clamp mount Scotty down riggers. The real key is finding them, once you have, they're actually pretty easy to catch. I've actually had them hit, no lie, my thermometer attached to a bell sinker. I had it hanging over the side of my boat, looking for the thermocline, when the rod starts bouncing. Goofy things must have heard the clacking between the plastic temp gauge and the sinker and starting hitting it. True story!!! They are a blast, are fun to catch, and good to eat."
