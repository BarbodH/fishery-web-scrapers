539065,salty,2004-04-22 20:02:00,8,He's a diehard Jimmy !verry loyal!we have tryed ..
539143,Guest,2004-04-27 19:57:00,0,"is the ice getting thin, hey?"
539146,salty,2004-04-27 20:39:00,8,yes the ice is gettig thin and the water is comming up nicely . will get sure numbers tomorrow and post it eh!
539148,Guest,2004-04-28 05:17:00,0,The LWCB website shows the water level 1 foot above last years opener level and steadily rising. How soon do you think the ice will go out? Mark
539179,salty,2004-04-28 20:15:00,8,could not get on the ice to check the thickness today (21 cel.) with heavy winds the shore lines have opened up the ice looks pretty bad the old timers at the coffee shop say 1 week and a half .the northern have just started to spawn.
539182,Guest,2004-04-28 21:53:00,0,"If the water is anywhere near the level it was at last year, I would go real slow and watch out for the rocks you can't see. You could be in 60 ft of water and 10 ft in front of you there may be a rock formation as big as a house 3 feet under the surface. I will say the fishing was out standing! Just take your time and have fun!"
538991,Guest,2004-04-19 18:23:00,0,I think we are going to catch them on the spawn on opening to bad alot of females will be caught witout spawnning hope people will the females go . as far has crooked yep thats the place you and 500 more people you can also get them in pelacan falls . where are you staying maybe you are at a lodge where I guide ..Also the lake is down like last year but we have lots of run off this year should help..
538994,Guest,2004-04-19 19:00:00,0,"we are staying at motel in sioux lookout, if you want to send me some info on guiding my address is [email protected] thanks"
538999,Guest,2004-04-19 21:47:00,0,"No one mentioned the Webster bridge - that is where our guides always take us. In regards to Pelican Falls - will the gate be unlocked on the opener? we like to drive down there & fish from where the ""mechanical portage"" runs. Last year the docks were 3 feet out of the water, tho!! Can't help but wonder which lodge Salty guides from? Hudson rules - I'd live there if I could get a job at McKenzie!"
539002,Guest,2004-04-20 05:15:00,0,webster bridge hey hush hush !! :-) As far as the gate at pelacan if it is not open just jump it a little walk .I guide at lost Iland lodge and Deer path lodge.
539028,orchard frank,2004-04-20 22:16:00,1900,"Hey salty, I just figured out who you were, live in Hudson,guide at Lost Island. Me and Esther are making an extra trip this year to celebrate our new boat (21' Tundra). We'll be up on the 26th of May. I know I'm going to get some grief from Jim and your brother about my new Optimax. I'll see if I can find a new secret musky lure for you in my stash. If the water is going to be that low, could you go around and paint all the rocks orange so we don't scratch the new boat? See you in about 5 weeks, Frank"
539030,Guest,2004-04-21 04:26:00,0,"Pretty slick Frank ,always nice to you guys. hope Ester lets you drive the boat!have a safe trip up .."
539042,Guest,2004-04-21 16:35:00,0,Pretty slick Frank .always nice to SEE you guys .Hope Esther lets you drive the New boat .Have a SAFE trip up ..
539049,orchard frank,2004-04-21 19:40:00,1900,"Salty: last week I was out walleye fishing on the Menominee R. up the road and caught a 62"" sturgeon on 10lb test!! Took 40 minutes of following her around, 30 minutes until the first time we saw her. It will be good practice for when I hook a 'ski jigging over in Kewatin. See ya"
539050,salty,2004-04-21 20:06:00,8,"Hey orchard Frank did you land it? Do you get to keep the fish, I know they are good eating I have tasted the ones north of here ..what size motor on the new boat?."
539056,orchard frank,2004-04-22 12:35:00,1900,"Got it in the boat, I'll show you a picture. Had to release it, out of season. New boat has 200 Optimax, but you know that Mercs dont get much respect on Lost Island!!!"
538756,Guest,2004-04-11 18:55:00,0,"heading up to sioux lookout for the opener, have never been on the lake before. any tips would be helpful, hey thanks in advance"
538760,Guest,2004-04-12 06:34:00,0,"I have been going there since 1981, I hope there is water in the lake. last year the opener was 9 feet down, rocks everywhere. I could not get to my favorite locations.The water level right now is the same as the opener last year, I hope it goes up before the opener! Mark"
538763,Guest,2004-04-12 09:17:00,0,"hey mark, any tips on where to fish on opener?"
538767,Guest,2004-04-12 10:33:00,0,"Fish shallow (4 to 11 feet), around structure, points, and dropoffs. I fish the opposite end of the lake ( 120 miles away) just east of Ear Falls in McKenzie Bay."
538940,Guest,2004-04-17 20:42:00,0,looks like another low water spring guys the lake is down 7.5 feet in frount of my house!
538942,Guest,2004-04-17 21:36:00,0,"salty, what part of the lake are you on? when do you think the ice will go out? jon"
538954,72HUNTER,2004-04-18 12:13:00,1,I grew up in Ear Falls & still go back there every year. Mackenzie Bay is no more than 30 miles from Ear Falls. Bear
538962,Guest,2004-04-18 19:56:00,0,"I live in Hudson .We have a big rain storm here today the ice got a big kickin, I say a couple of days a head of the big day or a little sooner ..."
538964,Guest,2004-04-19 04:44:00,0,Is the fishing good around Ear Falls during the opener? or do you travel to McKenzie Bay also? I look at the LWCB website every day and it seems like the water is comming up slowly. do you think it will be a foot or two higher than last year? Mark
538985,Guest,2004-04-19 15:34:00,0,"salty, have heard that crooked narrows can be good early in season. any other spots simliar to that? any help would be great, have not been on the lake before. thanks jon"
