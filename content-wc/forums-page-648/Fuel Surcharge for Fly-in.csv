566321,reelman1,2007-06-15 13:47:00,276,For all those outfits that are charging a surprise surcharge for gas I wonder if the price of gas were to have gone down they would have surprised you with a refund when you got to camp? If there is no provision for them to charge you more and you already booked the trip I would not pay it. This is a cost of doing business - once you set your price and get contracts you have to stick to that price.
566371,rpieske,2007-06-18 10:25:00,1276,"The fuel surcharge is understandable. The cost of fuel has skyrocketed in the past 6 months. Not informing you prior to arrival is not understandable. The reason for the increase in his rate structure may be related to what has happened to the American dollar on exchange. The US dollar is dropping like a stone and if he has been quoting you American dollars for rates, this could be the cause. If the rates were in Canadian dollars and he went up $200 Canadian, that is a different thing. Two years ago the Canadian Dollar was 1.22 against the US $. Now at the best trader rate (which we cannot get) it is 1.07. Most camps are at par now, because they get charged for conversion by their banks. I get 1.042 at my Canadian bank for the US $. That is a major reason for rate increases. Gone are the good old days of 2001 when the exchange was at 1.53. The camps that charge in US $'s and have not consistently increased their rates in accordance with the falling US $ have steadily taken a beating on their profits. Just trying to put things in perspective. Hope it helps you understand from their point of view."
565881,clemento,2007-06-03 13:23:00,48,My outfitter raised the price for 5 days of fishing by $200 dollars over last years rate. Last year I had to pay a surcharge of $50 so the actual increase I anticipated was $150. I was under the impression that this increse in rates would eliminate the surcharge but now he is going to bill me for the surcharge again. I think I am getting gouged. I would like to know if others are paying a surcharge and also how much did your rates go up? Cost of a 5 day fly-in is now almost $1400(food is included)
565884,Skylane,2007-06-03 17:08:00,101,"I don't know how far you are flying in, but the price of avaiation fuel is up to the equivalent of around $6.00 American per gallon and any plane they haul you into camp with uses a lot of fuel. Car gas/boat gas is equivalent to around $4.30 American(1.19 per liter) as of when I left Dryden on my way home Saturday. If your outfitter is charging you in US then the worsening exchange rate is also entering into the equation, besides what he is paying for gas. These two things are what is making the trip more expensive, the outfitter is probably just trying to maintain status quo. I guess the answer is to strengthen our weak dollar and to grow more of our own fuel (which will trickle down to lower the price per barrel of oil), rather than import from our enemies, which is part of what is weakening our dollar. Enjoy your trip, and let's hope those two things improve by next year."
565885,Guest,2007-06-03 17:46:00,0,"I fail to see the logic in charging a fuel surcharge and then also increasing the price of the fly-in under the guise of conuntering the increase in fuel prices. This is double-dipping. If the outfitter wants to collect a fuel surcharge, and you are willing to pay it, so be it. But that is enough, and for many, that is excessive. Meaning....he sets his price given some uncertainty in all things, and that is the cost of doing business. If his costs go up, he has less profit. Certainly he can attempt to recover those profits, but that is up to the customer and is not a definite. Anything that occurs after the initial agreement for the cost of the trip changes the deal, and essentially the customer is no longer obligated to perform. If the customer does perform (pay an extra cost) that is fine, but it is not a certainty. Where the extra $200 come in? Not for fuel as the outfitter has already recovered (the fuel surcharge last year, and the one this year--2 recoveries already). It is gouging, and I would be unwilling to accept the $200 charge. If he was upfront and asks for additional funds due to some other unforeseen reason, then again, the customer can accept or not. I would not. I resent being abused. Roy"
565890,Guest,2007-06-03 19:04:00,0,"The operator of the fly-in has to make ends meet. If the price of the fuel goes up, would you like him to dig deeper into his pocket with the potential of going out of business? Big deal, haven't you ever paid a fuel surcharge when you left from O'hare on a commercial flight? Be happy he doesn't charge a departure tax."
565891,Guest,2007-06-03 19:26:00,0,"You got charged 2 years in a row for a fuel surcharge? Shouldnt you mabey clarified the surcharge issue before giving your deposit for the trip the 2nd year esp after the first year you got charged?? Even after the price increase, I would count that as a lesson learned, next time I would suggest getting it in writing so theres no issues with no surcharges when you give the deposit for your trip."
565922,bigbuck,2007-06-04 10:54:00,69,"If he isn't willing to budge on the fuel surcharge, I'd spend a heck of a lot of time driving around in the boat sightseeing and looking for new fishing spots. $200 for a surcharge seems pretty steep. Do you even use $200 of fuel for your 1 week stay???"
565924,jigman 2003,2007-06-04 10:58:00,981,"Wow, $1400 for a 5 day trip is a lot of money. Hope the fishing is world class. We do a 7 day trip for around $1200. That's counting the gas to get there, our food, the flight etc."
565941,Guest,2007-06-04 16:32:00,0,I don't fish in Ontario anymore but do moose hunt. Our outfitter is charging 100.00 per person surcharge 3 guys 300.00. Speculation is that their dollar will surpase ours by year end so I suppose the next trick will be to charge in Canadian funds. I plan to hunt moose in Alaska next year even if it costs more. I think Alaskans still like Yanks so why go somewhere we're not liked.
565955,chuck c c,2007-06-04 21:42:00,34,"Retread, When you raise rates in your business, is it because you don't like your customers ? Do you belong to a union or have a pension plan which has a ""cost of living"" clause in the contract ? If so, it's because costs have or are expected to increase ? Most outfitters I know ( because I've been to their lodges or gotten to know them at the sports show through outfitters whose lodges I've been to) are just making a living. They make great fun of the outfitters who need a whole new clientel each year because of service or prices. I'm an American from Michigan who fishes in Canada whenever I can. I've found most Canadians to be friendly,fair and accommodating in my 33 years of flying/driving/boating in fishing trips. If you don't like the cost of gas, as I don't', take it up with our elected folks in Washington. Don't flog lodge or fly in owners for passing their cost increases along. I still think American Labatts Blue is brewed differently than the Canadian variety."
565960,jigman 2003,2007-06-05 06:04:00,981,"I think the reason Alaskans still like yanks is because they're yanks too ;-) Fuel surcharges are unfair. If an outfitter advertises a rate and you book the place at that rate, you should get that rate without any ""add ons"". Outfitters need to look ahead and speculate on fuel costs. If they must hit customers with a surcharge, they need to personally contact those customers BEFORE they get there to inform them of the fact. It is like blackmail otherwise. You drive 12+ hours, get there and find out it's going to be another $100. What are you going to do? Pay it of course. I can tell you that I would never use an outfitter again if that happened to me. Any yes, the Labatts we get in the States is different than the Canadian variety."
