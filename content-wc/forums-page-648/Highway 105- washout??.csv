566534,Trailerguy,2007-06-19 21:56:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]I don't think it was ever a resort. I've been told that Camp Robinson was a group of temperary houses set up by the lumber mill many years ago. It reached it's demise after a labor dispute. The people living there didn't own the homes or lots, so as they moved out the housing was mostly stripped and eventually dozed under. I beleive it was during that time frame that the lumber company quit actually harvesting themselves and started sub-contracting the lumber operations. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"

566546,Jazzy Lu,2007-06-20 08:52:00,11,"Yup that is similar to what I heard about Camp Robinson Rd. We use to go to Ord Lake 3-4 times a year for 20 yrs and my husband many more . There was an area along that road that was filled with lupines. I always figured someone with a green thumb had lived there. After the bridge went out they fixed up April Rd to get to Ord Lake. As we ""matured"" we found that it was so much easier on the body (and our boat) to fly in so that's when we started with Woman River Outposts. Now we are spoiled - cabin - all alone on the lake- gas refrig,stove,hot water -ahh life is good and so is the fishing!!!."

566377,Guest,2007-06-18 14:27:00,0,Just heard from an aquaintance that 105 between Vermillion Bay and Red lake is washed out. Does anyone know the status of this road?
566381,Guest,2007-06-18 15:10:00,0,"""Hwy 105 sustained considerable damage from heavy rainfall last week. This caved-in section of the highway south of Golden Hook Camp posed a major safety concern for unsuspecting motorists. Other areas of the highway were covered by water and many parts of the narrow shoulder were washed away or weakened by the runoff. Heavy rains flooded part of Hwy. 618 in Red Lake's west end on Tuesday May 30th. A number of houses on the roadway became waterfront property.""http://www.thenorthernsun.com/html/n..._sun_news.html"
566385,Guest,2007-06-18 15:52:00,0,"I saw a picture of that. From what tom said, this is more serious and has shut down the highway"
566404,pintaildux,2007-06-18 21:25:00,12,I just got back from as far as perrault falls and 105 was in good shape up to that point.I have did not hear of anything being washed out while I was up there last week.
566417,Guest,2007-06-19 08:20:00,0,Highway 105 was washed out by Camp Robinson yesterday and was closed for almost a day. The highway was opened last night around 7pm for light vehicle traffic only and it was expected to be open to all traffic this morning.

566435,Jazzy Lu,2007-06-19 14:07:00,11,Camp Robinson is north of Vermillion Bay . Camp Robinson was a resort way back but the road continues to bear its name. It will take you to Cedar Lake and beyond

566437,Guest,2007-06-19 14:59:00,0,"We will travel that stretch on Sat. a.m. Hope the road is open then. Hate to be on this side of a closed road. The other side would be a ""oh darn"" we have to stay an extra day!"
