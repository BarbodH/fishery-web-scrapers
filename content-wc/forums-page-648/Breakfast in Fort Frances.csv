566556,Guest,2007-06-20 19:01:00,0,"Actually, the best place to go is Barney's in the Falls. You just turn west on highway 11 and you will go past the theatre and Barney's is right next door. You will probably have to stand in line. Any last minute grocery items can be picked up next door at the grocery store."

566397,reconssd,2007-06-18 19:50:00,147,"This year my group wants to eat breakfast in Fort Frances. Since we usually drive straight through the town, I have no idea where we should dine. I did a google search and there wasn't much information on restaurants. Any help you can give us is greatly appreciated. If there aren't any really good restaurants in Fort Frances, what restaurant(s) would you recommend in Internationsl Falls? Thanks."
566407,Guest,2007-06-19 04:40:00,0,we used to eat at a restaurant in Fort Frances that was on the north side of 11 as you were heading east out of town..it was right across from the lake..if you can wait 20 mins and are going west on 11 the Emo Inn serves a good breakfast..we ate there this year but also stayed there overnight so it was convenient..in Int Falls theres the Chocolate Moose on the east side of 53 just as youre getting into town..further into town on 53 there used to be a Country Kitchen on the east side of the road..not sure if its still there though

566416,Guest,2007-06-19 08:03:00,0,"Emo does have 2 places to eat. The Emo Inn, I personally dont care for. And theres a small place, just past the Emo Inn on the south side of the road. Circle D. Better food and cheaper."
566421,reelman1,2007-06-19 09:31:00,276,McDonalds has all you can eat pancakes for $1.99 and they are actually pretty darn good!
566439,FISHNBOWLJOE,2007-06-19 15:27:00,80,"I second the vote for the Circle D in Emo. Stopped there the last two years. Good food, resonable prices and nice people. Last year I left my brand new fishing jacket there on the way up. We stopped on the way back and they still had it. Was I happy. I thanked the owner again this year and she sald you're welcome, and that it happens all the time. Nice little place. Joe"
