The biggest was 27.6 inches, many 19 to 23 inch walleye, and plenty of slot fish. The owner of the resort that I stayed at was also very helpful in showing and taking me to some of the spots that he knew held fish. I asked him if he does this for everyone and he said his idea of running a camp is to help renters find and catch fish so they would come back next year. His name is Duane H___ and he owns the Paridise Cove Resorts in Minaki. I will deffinetly being going back. The web site is paradisecoveminaki.com and the info address is [email protected] Deisel"
