We saw lots of prop and lower unit damage on other boats while we were there. The ramp at Archie's Landing was fine but there wasn't a dock next to it this year. There were a couple of shallow docks up the shore a bit on either side. Water temps ranged from the mid-50's in the main lake areas to the lower 70's in the shallow bays. For walleyes we actually did best with leeches this year. Crawlers were also good. Minnows and artificials were the least effective for us. We found them in small bunches in 15 to 5 FOW. A lot of good 17.5"" fish as well as many in and above the slot. Our largest was 'small' this year at 25"" Northerns were active as well. As usual you could throw just about anything but my personal favorite lure this year was a 6"" Grandma in the perch color, until I broke the lip off of it that is....The biggest pike on our trip were a 42"" and a fat 18lb 44"". Smallies were good this year on the rocks in the evenings. On our last night we hit a good pocket of them and caught about 10 all in a half hour with some walleyes and pike thrown in. The smallies were from 17 - 19"". Game Wardens were around camp (Mahkwa) all day on our first day and checked us twice. First time I've ever seen them in 12 years. They busted one group for having too many fish, not sure on the details but the fine was $250 EACH. Most of the bait shops and restaurants weren't even giving exchange rates. Simply going one-for-one with the USD. You'd be best off exchanging a few bucks here in the states for that type of stuff. The mayflies were starting during our week (11-17th) Regards,"
