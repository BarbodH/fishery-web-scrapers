Always gone through customs, east through downtown Ft. Frances, across the Rainy Lake narrows to the Dryden turnoff (left turn) and up 502 to Dryden. The road is desolate but well traveled so someone will be along if you need help. We've always traveled during the day so no problem seeing critters. We've seen a few bear but no moose. I would not travel this route at night unless I had another vehicle in the party in case of a moose collison. Where are you staying?"

Hoping we don't see too much wildlife (at least on the road) at this time of the morning. My report will be posted after my trip. Adios, eh!"

566591,Guest,2007-06-22 13:55:00,0,"wooglin Since you have been too Sioux Lookout you know what 502 is like. If you haven't driven it that early in the morning (sounds like you will be on it at 5:30-7:00 am) please make sure every one is awake and watch for moose. We drive home every year that time of the morning and we have yet to NOT see a moose (12 most, 1 least). It does seem like the moose are usually in the 50 miles nearest to Dryden though. I leave in 4 days 13 hours good luck"

We now take the western route instead of going through Dryden. It's a bit longer, but easier in some ways. If you want to try it, pick up a map and go home that way."

566580,skindzier,2007-06-22 08:55:00,137,"I would give a 2nd thumbs up to the western route. It is a little longer, but I think its more scenic, with LOW, Crow Lake & a bunch others visible throughout the trip. Highway 502 is pretty much dense woods - very little to look at other than that (although you have a good shot at seeing a moose on 502 - the down side is that they like to stand in the road - if you take 502 follow the speed limit, as a moose through your windshield will ruin your day). 502 is also absolutely desolate in terms of any civilization. There is exactly one business on the side of the road for the entire 100+ miles between Fort Frances & Dryden. The western route has a lot more places for help if you run into any problems. To take the western route you simply follow the signs for 71 coming off the bridge in International Falls - you'll go through Emo, Nestor Falls and Sioux Narrows before getting to Highway 17. Take that east to highway 105 then go north on 105."
