We have launched at Hudson many times and made the run to Taylors island area. I'm not sure what you mean by ""up to the lake"". But the areas called the ""rags"" is just north of Manitou Light/Manitou rapids. It is a short cut through a stump field. It is called the ""rags"" becasue they used to mark the channel with rags tied to the tree stumps that lined the deepest channel. If water is to low which it was earlier this spring than you need to go around an area called ""Devil's Elbow"". Leaving in 6 days!!!!! Good Luck"

566399,Guest,2007-06-18 20:15:00,0,We are heading up on the 21st and leaving on the 25th. Looks like we will just miss you. I was up the beginning of June and did well fishing up around Manitu. One boat had a 100 fish day. Our best was 75. The group fished Sen Bay the day before I arrived and had terrible luck. There was really strong winds that day. I am hoping to get up there on this trip because I like the run up there and enjoy fishing a few spots up there as well. We'll have to caompare fishing notes whenyou get back...Otts
