566357,Hammerhead Herb,2007-06-17 19:50:00,259,I'd purchase them at the duty free store in International Falls (right next to Border Bob's). That way you don't have to pay the tax and don't suffer the poor $ exchange rate.
566370,Guest,2007-06-18 10:22:00,0,What kind of cigars do they have at the duty free shop? El Cheapo or some good ones at a good price. Thanks!
566372,Hammerhead Herb,2007-06-18 10:38:00,259,"They sell both kinds. You can call them up at (218) 283 - 2556. Go to this URL http://www.dutyfreeamericas.com/ and work your way through 'locations' and then go to International Falls. I usually order my cigars through Fincks out of Texas. If you got time, the order usually comes within 3 - 4 business days. They are atwww.fincks.com There's nothing finer than sitting around the campfire at night drinking a bottle of Labatt's, puffing on a Padron 3000, eating freshly popped buttered popcorn, and watching the Northern Lights."
566382,Hammerhead Herb,2007-06-18 15:10:00,259,OOPS!!! Administrative error on my part. The Fincks website is http://www.finckcigarcompany.com/
566383,FISHNBOWLJOE,2007-06-18 15:13:00,80,Just got back from Kenora. There's a little gas station on the corner of 11 and 71 as you turn north to go to Kenora. We had to stop a and get a couple of gallons of gas to get us to IF. They had all kinds of cigars there. Maybe even some Cuban. Joe
