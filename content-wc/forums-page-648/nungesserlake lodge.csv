564786,Guest,2007-04-27 20:23:00,0,How long does it take to get to Nungessor Lodge from the border?
564830,sidewinder,2007-04-29 11:16:00,96,round about answer about 45 mins to hour past red lake. depends on how fast you drive on gravel road
564838,Guest,2007-04-29 20:39:00,0,I belive it to be 5 and a half to 6 hours from International Falls.
564842,Guest,2007-04-30 07:00:00,0,I thought this lake was strictly boat -in from Balmertown. Must be wrong

566538,Guest,2007-06-20 04:52:00,0,"I have been going to Nungesser Lake Lodge for the last 6 years, older guys in my group over 10 [before the current owners]. the camp is a bit old, but there are updates every year we come up. Chad and Tanya are great hosts, and have always taken care of us well. their staff has always been their strength, but my understanding is their best guy, who has been there for years [Eddie] was asked to 'pursue other opportunities' after last season... Boats are not as good as AK's, but workable. Gas is included, but anything else [trolling motors, etc...] is extra. Overall, a very good value for the money. If someone in your group wants to bear hunt, Chad can accomodate. there's always 1-3 hunters every time we go up."

564286,Guest,2007-04-04 15:13:00,0,looking for any info on this lodge and lake. like hows the fishing and general shape of the camp and boats. i may join 3 others begining of june. thanks pike all day.
564288,5richards,2007-04-04 15:59:00,131,I fished Nungesser last July with seven guys -- weather was very warm and lake was low --- we stayed at Anglers Kingdom with Kevin Geary - from what I saw he has the best equipment --- large boats with 40 hp electric start motors -- live wells etc -- very accomodating - will put you on fish we got one pike over 40 and @ 20 lbs a very good time -- looks like the other camp boats can't compare
564476,sidewinder,2007-04-13 11:39:00,96,Hi I have been to nungesser.(two years ago) I know both owners Kevin has the best equipment Tonya at Nungesser has best rates (figures) If budget was issue then Nungesser 40hp not needed on lake but nice unless you hit something we were there july 4 weekend--good walleye fishing kevin has reputation for pike so may be worth money to have him guide or at least get advice. just some thoughts sidewinder we are headed to Boois on Trout Lake 32 days away! sidewinder

564566,sidewinder,2007-04-17 01:51:00,96,"Ed We were there last week in june and first week in july, Eyes had akready dispersed. Chad put us on the fish.There are some nice humps that time of year. We caught 22""-24"" every day with several 26"". I would guess the inlet and outlet of nungesser would be hot. Where are you staying? We would go again. Great value=privacy of fly in at drive in rates sidewinder"

564759,Guest,2007-04-26 16:09:00,0,Im hoping for some feedback from someone who has been to this lodge.I would love some info before I commit to this trip. thanks pike all day
564761,5richards,2007-04-26 16:43:00,131,ask the lodge what their gas policy is for the boats -- do you get gas every day or do you pay for it. It really adds up
564784,sidewinder,2007-04-27 18:06:00,96,"Nungesser in June would probably have eyes moving out of moving water. The inlet way north and outlet should be good. I f i remember the outlet has some flats,should be jammed with walleye. In July we did not even get a bite at the outlet. Some nice humps on the lake also. Chad and Tonya were wonderful hosts. We are headed to Trout Lake for two weeks starting May17.You can see Trout Lake when you are driving to Nungesser (on the right) Won't be long sidewinder"
