I've never been concerned about the water in any of the camps and have never had any problem. Like some others have stated on this board, ""Happy wife - happy life"". What should I be looking for?

What comes up is a small uv device that you can insert in a glass of water for safe drinking water. Price is $99.00 U.S. Looks kind of handy and might make your wife happier about drinking the lake water."
