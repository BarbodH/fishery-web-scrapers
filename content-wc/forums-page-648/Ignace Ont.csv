565677,back357,2007-05-29 12:42:00,106,"I'll be up there the second week of June and have been checking the Ministy's water data for the past couple of weeks. Here's what I know so far: Water level is lower than the past few years. Probably down about 1 1/2 to 2 feet. They have been getting a good amount of rain for the past two weeks. Not sure how long it will take to get into the system, but the English River inflow and outflow looks to be on the rise. I did hear the spawn was good though. Tons of Walleye in the rivers. Kukukus looks to be accesible from Dome on the South side although they have been bumping the logs getting there. It shouldn't be a problem from the North side. There are going to be rocks out there that you may not have seen before, so take it easy. As far as some of the other lakes, I don't think there is much of an issue. Flatrock might be tough to get into from Arethusa. If you can get there from Dollar, you might want to give it a shot. Barrel and Heathwalt look good. Not sure about Pacguci. The water has been so high up there for the past two-three years, that I am looking forward to a bit lower to concetrate the fish more. Not sure where you fish on Kukukus, but I would think that the first series of points on the right hand side when you come out of Dome should be good. That bay will be shallow. Gull Rock should produce as well. I'd fish a bit off of the rock face that faces Gull Rock. I'll give you a full report when I get back (June 17th). Just let me know what info you want."
565701,Guest,2007-05-30 11:00:00,0,Are you staying at Flayer's? Which lakes do you fish?
565706,back357,2007-05-30 11:53:00,106,"I stay in Ignace at Agimak Lake Resort. We fish Kukukus, Barrel, Heathwalt, Flat Rock, and Arethusa. We bring all of our own boats and motors up and drive to the lakes each day. A bit more work, but still fun."
566345,guidedfishing,2007-06-17 08:50:00,531,"T-Bird Water levels were down about 1 foot from previous high water years. All in all water levels are not that bad considering 3-4 years ago the water was very high. Flatrock is accessible (no problem) via Arethusa, there is one portion that is a little hairy, I managed to get a very heavly loaded 17 1/2 foot boat thru, It is somewhat easier going in as you are against the current and have some better power/control, I did bump once on the way out. We had a decent week of fishing. good luck GF"
566348,back357,2007-06-17 10:53:00,106,T-bird I agree that water levels are only down a bit if any. Kukukus is perfect IMO. No prob getting from Arehusa to Flatrock. We fished the bay across from the big island and knocked them dead. Anywhere the wind was blowing in and there was some sand produced loads of fish. We fished Kukukus 3 days and almost got tired of catching fish if you can believe it. Healthwalt produced as well. The wind was up all week. Temps were high though. Be prepared for some heat.
