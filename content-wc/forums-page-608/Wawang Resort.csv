574638,Stu,2008-06-04 00:05:00,472,"Is anyone going to Wawang this year (or did you go last year)? This resort always gets mixed reviews. It was listed as one of the top 10 resorts for walleye AND northern by Ontario Anglers Awards in 2006 and a top 10 walleye resort in 2007, but I have heard bad things about the accomodations. Any info is appreciated. Thanks - Stu"

574658,Guest,2008-06-04 13:07:00,0,"Stu, Do a search with ""wawang lake"" and you'll see many threads. The place seems interesting yet controversial. I just did a search....are you the same Stu that has asked before about Wawang (over multiple years)? Have you not been yet?? Personally, I've never fished it, but if I was giving advice to somebody traveling from far away, it would be to go somewhere that consistently produces. Most drive too far and have far too short a trip to be driving around the lake trying to figure out the current pattern (if there even is aggressive fish to be found). You know what? I might just drive over there and try it out...it's less than 2 hours away. If I do, I'll be certain to post my reflection. NWO Fishing Bum"

575144,Stu,2008-06-17 00:10:00,472,"NWO Fishing Bum, yes, that was me. I have been considering Wawang for some time. The fact that you could drive to a secluded lake appealed to me. If you get a chance to check out Wawang, please let us know what you think. I just got back from Thaddeus and had a great time. I will probably be going back there from now on. Thanks for the info - Stu"
575179,Guest,2008-06-17 22:17:00,0,"Robert T....Did I just read this correct, 4 guys for 5+ days and you boated 11 walleye. No offence meant here, but that is what I do in an average morning by myself on LS. If that is what your group did, I would consider that lake a dead sea compared to MANY others."
575201,Guest,2008-06-18 21:25:00,0,"We were casting mainly for big pike.The walleyes that were caught,were taken incidental to our pike fishing.If we had specifically targeted walleye numbers would have been much higher,as there were plenty being caught by others in camp at that time."
575251,Guest,2008-06-20 13:50:00,0,"OK I get it. I don't target Northerns at all, I don't want the slimey buggers in my boat to attract all those flies, fling slime and smell everything up. Just me!"
