575062,Guest,2008-06-14 06:28:00,0,Saftey hooks on the ends of your saftey chains. S hooks are not allowed. Manual bailing device.
575077,Bill Krejca,2008-06-14 13:48:00,6107,Have any safety equipment on board that is required by your state.
575078,Guest,2008-06-14 17:25:00,0,I got the safety hooks and all the times i towed up there no one ever got out of the booth to check them. I stopped using them.
575082,Dipstick,2008-06-14 21:08:00,101,"It's not Canada Customs that will stop you. OPP or COs might. Last summer they were stopping trailered boats at truck weigh stations and on the the TransCanada Hwy. Checked for live minnows and leeches being brought into the Ont from out-of-province and worms not in bedding, also for closed safety chains. Fines were hefty for each of those. A few Manitobans were caught for these offences on their way to LOTW."
575085,jn864,2008-06-15 08:07:00,3,Thanks for all the replies. Need to change the hooks.... Jn
575086,Muskygary,2008-06-15 08:54:00,137,What is a safety hook? Is it any hook with a closed snap? Can it be bolted onto your chains?
575092,rpieske,2008-06-15 13:07:00,1276,Any style hook sufficient to bear the load which closes. There are types that feed onto the chain then are threaded to close. There are others that feed on the chain and then snap close.http://www.bosunsupplies.com/product...?product=S0120http://www.bosunsupplies.com/product...?product=S0160
