Not sure how people were doing with walleye cause I wasn't fishing for them but the ones I did catch were above the slot limit. We absolutely hammered the bass, my hands, elbow and wrist are so sore it's not even funny."

This year an unexpected early retirement and start of a new job resulted in loosing my summer vacation. It's good to hear that, despite the cost of gas and everything else, you were able to make it and it sounds like you got your money's worth. Now, just between you and me....where was that bass spot? I promise not to tell a soul...... Randy"
575287,Guest,2008-06-21 13:58:00,0,Randy....just about any bay was productive. I'm not crazy about fishing the spawn for bass but you get what you get and we got them good :)
