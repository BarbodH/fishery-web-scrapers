575075,Guest,2008-06-14 12:08:00,0,With the severe weather we have had lately does anyone take a weather radio to Canada? The cabin in Minaki has a T.V. but a weather forecast from the Detroit station is really not that helpful for Big Sand. Any suggestions or comments? I am looking at a battery powered Midland for $59.99 on the Cabela's web site. Last year we had small hand held two way radios for boat to boat contact that had a weather broadcast channel. Has anyone ever noticed that for some strange reason the TV weather radar display always seems to stop right at the Canadian border? Wouldn't it be nice if it went further north. Does the radar need a passport too? Randy @ ORD

As for available NOAH stations in your location you may wish to check the NOAH web site for coverage and what stations they broadcast on. Grundig, Garmin, and ETON, to name a few are good units that have NOAH scanning features. AM band radios may also pick up some channels with NOAH, so researching them may be an option worth exploring too. Contact the Canadian gov by email may yield stations for the region you wish too.
