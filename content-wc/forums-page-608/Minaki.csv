575065,Guest,2008-06-14 08:01:00,0,I missed this post Erik. We left that morning.I seen you guys there camped behind us but didn't know it was you or I would have come by for a few.I may of talked to you at the dock though.I had the Tracker with the new merc on it. Hope you guys had good luck it was only average for us.Going back next year? We may have to compare some notes.
575095,WalleyeCrazy2,2008-06-15 17:24:00,29,"Yeah, I remember your boat. I talked to a bunch of people on the dock, I was not sure that you would get that note before you left. We had the Crestliner 1850, grey with the mooring cover on it. Yamaha 150 and 8hp. I am definately going back next year. 12 years and counting. We have above average fishing this year. Not our absolute best fishing, not a single trophy, but many many 23+ walleye's. Some great small mouth, and plenty of mid 30"" Pike. Even got bored fisning one day and didn't use the net. Best count of the week was over 150 walleye for 3 guys! Drop me an email and we can compare notes! I have everything in the GPS. Erik"

574467,Guest,2008-05-30 07:17:00,0,Google Maps will give you the same perspective.
574477,Guest,2008-05-30 09:14:00,0,I thought that was just a nice cottage !!
574478,Guest,2008-05-30 09:18:00,0,Goshawk is past White Dog and I believe is connected to the English river. This lake has some good size lakers in it. Have been there only in winter
574491,Guest,2008-05-30 12:58:00,0,Leaving in a few hours and I cant stand it!!!!!! Ha hope all goes well and all your trips go well also.

574517,Guest,2008-05-31 09:15:00,0,"Any of you Minaki Regulars been over to Vermillion, Ena, Corn, Lately ? Have not been up that way in years, was always good fishing. JJ"

574735,Guest,2008-06-06 11:26:00,0,"Just got back last night. Border was very easy this year in winnipeg. no problems. arrived at jackfish bay sat and fished lost bay till dark that night. caught 3 northerns over 30"". First two hours of sunday was spent boating around trying to figure out where i was and getting acquainted with the buoy system. after a couple of hours i was ready to fish and we fished octo island, harbour island bay and mine bay. Caught alot of northerns and one 46"" musky in mine bay. Two norhterns were over 35"". Mon was spent at deadmans bay, finger bay, duck bay, and vermillion bay. caught lots of northerns, two more muskies (38 and 40) and about 20 bass with the largest being 20.5"". Tues we had some boat issues and only fished half a day, but caught alot of smallies and northerns. Road down to jackfish was good, weather was ok, cold front coming in when we left but overall it was ok. One day they must have let the dam open as the current was unbelievable at the bridge with big swells etc. this was my first time to minaki so maybe thats normal but the other days it wasnt like that. wind blew pretty hard two days, hard for the boat handler but the fish bit then. almost ran out of gas one day and had to walk from gas station (northstar?) down railroad tracks to camp...ugh.. didnt think about bears until about half way there and remembered the 500#er we saw last year and I picked up the pace to say the least. did not fish for walleyes at all, planned to but the bigger northerns were biting and it was too much fun. any questions i can answer be glad to and hope you all have a good trip this year."
574286,Guest,2008-05-25 10:02:00,0,Just wondering where you got the maps for gun lake? Do you have the maps for Little Sand and Big Sand. Thanks for the help. George
574289,Guest,2008-05-25 10:42:00,0,"i bought them on line, heres some ways to check for them[email protected] or www.charts.gc.ca and really i think i just googled maps of winnipeg river system to find the maps. You can choose the area you fish from the menu and I think i paid 19.99 for the map...and you get the ginsu!!!! Any other help just ask."
574290,Guest,2008-05-25 10:55:00,0,Got a number and website to be exact. 866-369-7024 and fishingmap.com
574292,Guest,2008-05-25 13:21:00,0,"The site that has the map in my previous post, only has a limited amount of the Minaki area. I have the Government paper maps, and also have the Navionics Great Lakes North for the GPS -- they are essentially the same. The Hot Maps I also have for my GPS has excellent detail for south of Minaki, but is poor north of Minaki. They have paper maps at the two marine gas stations in Minaki, but they are more expensive than you can get on some of the websites. Chuck"
574301,DonC,2008-05-25 19:36:00,93,"wolverine fan, Our group will be up there the same time as you. We will be fishing 4 groups out of Birch Island Resort. I am 53 and my partner is 74. We will have my 28 year old daughter with us this year. Her husband has gone on active duty for 2 years with the MS guard so she gets to come with us. I just got back from fishing Lake St. Clair and Belleville Lake last week with 2 brothers. You mentioned in the past your are from MI. We caught around 180 bass, mainly smallmouth in 3 days. Also some walleye. Hard to beat the fishing in MI and Minaki. If you see us out on the water, give us a shout and we can swap lies. Don C"
574323,Guest,2008-05-26 17:56:00,0,"Don- Sounds like you had a great time im Mi. Awesome. I just got back from a day long trip to cabelas, used my birthday money and gift cards for a new goretex jacket cause the weather sure doesnt look like i will need any tank tops!! We were truly hoping to be staying on Dead boys island in a new cabin but since the ice stayed so long we are now relocated to jackfish bay. Never have been anywhere near minaki, probably harbour island the farthest south ive been. Got some advice here to hopefully put us on some fish in the area. We really like to just use the trolling motor and work the banks and such for smallies, northerns and if we catch a muskie so be it. Only fishing half a day for walleye to eat and it sounds like under the train tressel is the palce to start. I suppose we'll fish alot of the bays such as mine, lost lake (hidden) etc etc. I like that type of fishing. We'll be three in a boat with me, dad and my brother. We'll meet up in winnipeg sat am at 1030am!!!! Hope your trip goes well and may all your snags turn to fish!!"
574438,Guest,2008-05-29 16:35:00,0,"Here's a link to Rob Bennet's website, he has a cabin on Dead Boys Island, and is building another. If you go to Location, you'll see an aerial map of the Winnepeg, Minaki and surrounding lakes, rivers, etc. You can scroll around and do some limited zooming in:http://www.sandlakeoutpost.com/index.htm I'm in no way associated with Rob or his business, just have known him for 20+ years. The map puts an interesting perspective on the water, shorelines, etc. in that area. Chuck"

573972,Guest,2008-05-16 09:13:00,0,"Boys it'just about that time to be heading north for our annual Winnipeg River Trip. Looking for a little help here. We have always fished rough rock andlittle sand but only to harbour island. This year we are staying in Minaki and I dont know the river system down there. We really like to target the northerns and whatever comes with fishing for them. We will jig one day for walleyes so any help there would be appreciated. Looks like the water will be cooler this year also. Staying in Jackfish Bay area. I do have a hydro map but it does not have alot of the local names of fishin' holes, any help appreciated and good luck to everyone this year."
573973,Guest,2008-05-16 09:45:00,0,When are you going?
573975,Guest,2008-05-16 10:01:00,0,"Be there sat may 31st till aug 30!! Yea I wish, leaving the 6th."
573976,Guest,2008-05-16 12:33:00,0,I will give you some info later today when i have some time. I suppose I will have to use little words if you are indeed a wolverine fan. :) Better yet I'll be back on the 2nd of June. I can get you a more up to date report on the stretch of water south of Minaki. We never have been north of the bridge.
573977,Guest,2008-05-16 12:42:00,0,"Here's some spots on Gunn Lake, south of Minaki, that are just around the corner from Jackfish Bay. They will give you a chance to get familiar with the Minaki area, and here's a map segment you can use:http://www.kenora-ontario.com/rivermap8.htm - The shoreline from Alman's Bay to Runion's Bay usually holds large northern and early season smallies. It is fairly shallow and the water warms early. The two bays themself can be very good at times. The saddles between Boyd Island, Padburges Island and the no name island to the south east of them are good for northern just about anytime during the year. - Work the shorelines around Virgin Island, Brown's Island and the point to the south of it. If the weed growth is light, check out a little deeper with tubes for smallies. - Check out the cove on the east side of Big Island and the shoreline between Bathgates Point to the bouy south of it. Steeper shorelines will frequently hold smallies at the base of the ledge and the shallow shorelines will hold northern early in the season. - The rock piles and point in the lower right hand side of the map segment often hold northern, musky and smallies. The humps off these areas are also good for walleye if there is any wind or water current from the river. You'll see them on the sonar if they are there, you can jig or rig them with minnows, black Gulp minnows or black 3"" gulp leeches. - Just north of Minaki on the other side of the river is Lost Bay. You can work the north shorelines as you go into the bay, all the way around to the resorts on the other side. You can even go into Lost Lake, just watch out for the rocks as you work your way in! (The lake is small in size, but may hold early season crappie on the north shoreline if the water is warm enough.) Northern and smallie fishing should be pretty good in the shallower parts of the bay itself, if weeds are there and current isn't too bad (it will flow through the bay, into Lost Lake and out the other side into Milner's Bay). There are some big northern and musky that will stage in this area early in the season (walleye are often found near the 2 humps that are back toward Lost Lake), up until mid-June. Chuck"
573978,Guest,2008-05-16 12:50:00,0,"campchef, When you get back let me know how the road going down to the cabins on Jackfish Bay is, since we'll be using it the week after you leave. We've got some bigger boats and the last few 100 yards of the gravel road down to the railroad crossing can be interesting at times, due to winter run-off and spring storms. Jackfish Bay itself often holds some nice northern, in the big part of the bay to the south west of the ramp/dock. I often pickup a couple musky in there as well, it's a good spot to get out of the wind, and is a 'stones throw' from the cabins. This part of the bay doesn't get fished much, but there is a nice shallow hump with sparse weedgrowth, that will hold decent fish. Chuck"
573979,Guest,2008-05-16 13:04:00,0,I am actually staying at Big North.

573981,Guest,2008-05-16 13:43:00,0,No problem.....I will be able to give you a heads up on the fishing anyway
