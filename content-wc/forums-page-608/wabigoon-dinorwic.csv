575053,Guest,2008-06-13 19:30:00,0,"Unsettled weather this week but decent fishing! 32"" has been the largest walleye so far, lots of nice eaters, as well as a few other trophys released. The water is still in the high 50's to low 60's. Still catching walleyes shallow near the feeder creeks and spawing islands, but they are starting to move out to the humps. The Smallies are starting to nest and we have had a few 4 lb. ers released this week! The weeds aren't up yet but we have been getting lots of slot pike, as well as quite a few in the high 30's low 40's. Fish ON !www.bonnybay.com"
