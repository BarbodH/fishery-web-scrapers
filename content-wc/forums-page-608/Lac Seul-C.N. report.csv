574997,Guest,2008-06-12 14:29:00,0,"As promised...Just got back from Ojibway last night, and have a report(repay for previous reports sent my way). Weather was rainy most of the time, though not bad. Winds out of the North predominetly. Caught most walleye in approx. 12-15' of water with jigs and minnows. Had best luck in the narrows and ski doo point. Big was 26.5"" for the week. Lots of nothers taking walleye on the way up. Heard the game wardens were in camp the previous week, but we didn't see them. Tried to get a non VIP for next year, but sounds like those are getting slim. Not sure the VIP are worth the extra money? but what can you do. Good trip, all in all. Water was normal or above normal."
574998,Hump,2008-06-12 14:47:00,578,What is a VIP?
575000,Jimmy Jig,2008-06-12 14:51:00,1905,Very Important Person
575013,CH47,2008-06-13 08:23:00,29,"Hump, The VIP in this post refers to the type of cabin that they stayed in with Ojibway Outfitters. They have regular and 'VIP' cabins and are different rates. Regards, CH47"
575020,Hump,2008-06-13 09:15:00,578,Thanks. I'm not good with letters on license plates or internet. I still don't know what ttt means!
575021,CH47,2008-06-13 09:19:00,29,No problem. TTT took me a while to figure out too. I was too lazy to ask and finally saw a thread where someone else asked. It stands for To The Top and people will use it to move a thread to the top of the page in the hopes of getting more responses. CH47
575025,Hump,2008-06-13 10:38:00,578,"Thanks. I firmly believe there is no dumb questions, however, many dispute me on that. What does the VIP offer that the other cabins don't?"
575027,CH47,2008-06-13 10:46:00,29,I'm not sure. I checked their site and there is no mention of the differences. You'd have to ask someone who has stayed there or call them directly. Their full name is Lac Seul Outposts. You can type that into a search engine and get to their site. The closest I've come to their operation is buying bait at the shop next to their offices in Sioux Lookout.
575031,IMWalleye,2008-06-13 12:13:00,35,"The VIP cabins are larger with a front deck; and have indoor bathroom/shower with hot/cold running water. Worth it, especially in the middle of the night when you swear there are a dozen bears out there. The MNR did visit the camp on June 3, as they worked their way up the lake. They dropped off a couple of confiscated coolers containing beer. Also, they searched the freezers in each cabin with the owner's permission - no citations that I am aware of. Our boat got checked the next day as they worked their way back - the two officers were very cordial and professional. I hear , though, that they have now been empowered to right citations for ""open container""."
575124,Guest,2008-06-16 16:07:00,0,Leaving Friday & wondering if anybody just returned with any reports?
