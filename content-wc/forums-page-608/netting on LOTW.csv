575081,wiggle,2008-06-14 20:34:00,400,"I was up on Lake of the Woods this past week. Tuesday afternoon we were casting along a shoreline and I got a snag. My snag turned out to be a gill net approx 150' long or longer. It was in 3-4' of water and full of fish. Anywhere from fresh dead fish to fish that have been dead for quite some time. There was even a beaver stuck in the net. I was going to pull it out onto the shore, but it was stuck in the rocks and not coming out. So....it is still there catching and wastefully killing fish. Then I noticed on a couple different rocks around the lake, there were nets that other fisherman must have pulled out. On thursday afternoon, I noticed a couple of ""natives"" putting out more nets. I saw them set 2 different sets of nets. This was in Lobstick Bay, east of Sioux Narrows. You may wonder why I would come on here and tell this story. Well, because it really makes me sick. And.....it is really hard to have a discussion with my 10 and 14 year old sons about why the indians would do something like that. They were and still are really upset about what they saw....as am I.

Then I read your name, checked your registration and figured out that you were probably staying at your brother's (dlhomes) place on LOTW, we stayed there in 2000. That is disturbing news, especially since we will be at Laughing Water Trailer Park on 7/5 for 2 weeks. Can the MNR do anything about this or is this part of the Native rights? Bellbuoy"
575137,wiggle,2008-06-16 20:29:00,400,Hey.....we own the cabin together!!!:-) Ya know....I was also wondering if the MNR would be interested in the net that I found. It was very obvious that it was a net on the loose until it found the place that it is in now. I think I will give the MNR a call and give them the GPS coordinate to the net and see if they will check it out. It is worth a try anyway. I would think that the MNR would want to know this kind of thing. Then again??????????????? Brad
575140,Obabikon,2008-06-16 21:21:00,2370,Any unmarked net is illegal and should have the MNR called as quickly as possible.
575158,rockpt,2008-06-17 10:06:00,589,MNR will drag it out if you tell them where it is. I snagged an abandoned net last Oct. off of North Island. Disgusting.
