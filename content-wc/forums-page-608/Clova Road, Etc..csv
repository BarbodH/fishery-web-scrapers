We always stopped right before and filled up and always asked at the gas station what it was like, and they usually knew the conditions. 1st year it took us about 3 hrs to travel it, the 2cd yr was about 1/2 that time."
575200,Guest,2008-06-18 18:30:00,0,hi - what camp are you going to via the clova road? depending on where you are going i might have a better suggestion WG

575216,Guest,2008-06-19 15:08:00,0,"The fishing at O'Sullivan has actually gotten better or it seems that way. We happen upon new ""favorite"" spots every year. We are from various spots in NY and have missed a few trips over the years but keep coming back. We actually enjoy the trip down the Clova Road."
575218,brucepa,2008-06-19 16:47:00,9,"ironwood, i am with you. we try and find a couple new spots each year and recently got hooked on finding open water locations since we typically fished near shore previous years (wind blown shores, seams around points, etc.). I think the fishing has definitely improved since russell took over and increased the keeper size gradually to where it is now. The lake is paradise and we are sure going to miss it this one year. next year we are back with vengeance. i enjoy the clova going in but coming out it is always depressing and long. we take our own boats in as well and the clova can really ""grab you and your equipment"". one year we broke a trailer spring 35 miles from camp at 9:15 pm, unhitched and raced to camp. russell drove out with a spare trailer and we transferred the boat and got back to camp around 11:30pm. he had new springs ordered for our trailer by breakfast the next morning, picked them up durng the week and installed them on our trailer one day while we were out on the lake. only charged us material cost. that is a fine gentlemen and lodge operator. do you folks take your own boats in and do you usually go the same week each year/ this is killing me not going up this year..........."
