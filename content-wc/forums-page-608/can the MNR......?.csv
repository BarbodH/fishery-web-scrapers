575135,Dore,2008-06-16 19:46:00,43,"I'm not sure about Ontario but in the provence of Quebec the regulations for the police & the MNR are VERY different. I had a lawyer friend explain it to me once. The MNR can do a random search of your truck, boat, camp ect without any probable cause that you are breaking the law. They could stop you to check you limit & find something else & charge you for it. If you are charged & the case proceeds to court the burden of proof is less for the MNR than a regular police charge. I'm not sure if this officer having you take him on a trip looking for someone else is OK but I think that he can request that you take him to your camp for an inspection. You have to remember that there are a lot of lakes with lots of boats on them & VERY few MNR officers. Following the local regs & helping the MNR helps us all in the long run"

When carrying out their duties Conservation Officers may do the following: Stop and inspect a vehicle, boat or aircraft Ask questions relevant to the inspection Enter onto private property in the discharge of their duties Inspect buildings or other places Search with a warrant Search without a warrant in circumstances requiring immediate action Require the assistance of persons to complete an inspection of coolers and containers Seize items related to an offence Arrest anyone the Conservation Officer believes has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offence. They can not make you take them over to another boat too check them. And if they asked me too,, Id tell them no thanks ive paid alot for my vacation,, are there any further things regaurding me? if not ill be on my way now!"
575145,Guest,2008-06-17 05:46:00,0,"Years back they had more search options. There is a huge difference between ""inspect"" and search. I would never allow any officer to search my cottage or place of residence without a warrant. A lot of officers are very good at getting you to agree to the search. The charge of ""lying to a CO"" carries a bigger fine than the actual offence. I will never offer any additional information to an officer than what he is asking for. Always consider your answer before speaking or ask ""I am uncomfortable with your questions"

Do you mean cabin when you say camp? Could they search your house the same way? I wonder if it matters if it is a rental or not?"

The only thing mentioned in the original post which is not regulated/require compliance is the request for you to take him to other boats or back to your cabin. I would have never agreed to that...say 'Sorry, my time on the water is too valuable to be escorting you around while you're paid to do your job.' A float plane can taxi around a lake near as well as a boat. NWO Fishing Bum"
575171,phishfearme,2008-06-17 18:36:00,1242,"canuck and bum - thanks for the feedback - but i still can't see myself telling a ministry officer that i'm too busy fishing to help him out - even though i'm not really required to assist. i consider it an honor to be visiting your country and using one of your most valuble resources and i'll do what i can to help the people tasked with protecting it. these guys have what i consider to be an extreemly difficult, thankless job. no doubt there's a possibilty for them to abuse their power but i would consider that to be a small exception to the no doubt vast majority of diligent officers. our experience with officer maw was very businesslike with no animosity involved. i didn't have my license on board the boat with me - which is probably a violation - but i showed him the license when we got to the cabin and he said from now on keep it in my tackle box. it occurs to me that if we woulda been less than cooperative i may have had to pay a fine. phish"
