In part because in winter, Cliff and Cedar had a mess of break-ins at camps, mainly gas was stolen from what I've heard. He went on to tell me that a man died 3 days ago on Wabaskang. I have never been on that lake but he said they parked at the side of the falls, got out, looked around and when they backed up to leave, the current took the boat over the falls. Both had on life jackets, but one just didn't make it. [My thoughts and prayers go out to the families!] He also said opening weekend they rescued a group on an island on Eagle lake. They got disoriented, ran out of gas and made it to an island. All were ok thank god. Then you may have read about Jared and 2 other camp owners on LOTW who resued some guys who's boat over turned. Just reminding everyone to be safe!!!"
575104,Guest,2008-06-15 21:52:00,0,Was back at Wine Lake last week which you have to boat across Wabaskang to get back to. The falls these fisherman went over is actually below Wabaskang and back towards Wine Lake. The falls are referred to us as Forbidden Falls by our maps. I have been to Wine 5 times and never have been back there and the people that have been back there said it is tricky and they would never go back. The resort owners at Wine Lake don't recommend going back there. Said to here any deaths on these lakes. Scott
