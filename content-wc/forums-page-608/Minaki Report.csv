Water temps were 56-58 in the river and main lakes with 62 degrees in the back bays. Walleyes were staged in anywhere from 16 to 22 feet of water. Both bouncer and lindy rigs worked best with leeches and minnows worked very slowly. Weather was not great so they weren't hitting hard. Largest walleye ran over 28"" with majority in the 16"" to 20"" range. We also did some evening cranking with reef runners on rock shorelines near known walleye structure; got many in the 16, 17 and 18"" range with one Musky in the mid 40's... we did a water unhook & release just in case she was still spawning. All in all, the cold water and weather is not slowing the progression of the walleye's seasonal habits. J.P."
