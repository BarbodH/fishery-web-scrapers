574908,Guest,2008-06-10 19:19:00,0,"Hey Bud, I was thinking we should get together and compare names of places. I never heard of MInnkota bay. and I don't know why everyone uses directions like north end or sw of this or that island. Maybe I should get a compass. I wonder if they come in boxes of blue?"

We had a pretty good week. Tony"

575178,walleye_wal,2008-06-17 21:24:00,12,"Hello all, Gullrock report for week of June 7-13. Fishing was good, jig and live bait drifting out fished every method for numbers, but by far trolling was better for size. We picked up fish on almost every point we fished as long as there was a good wind blowing in. Good luck by the straight and the boot. Go amount at the mouthes of a couple bays. All in all good first trip. We will be looking to coming back for years to come. wal"

574646,dirt,2008-06-04 07:27:00,144,Bump We are headed up in a couple of weeks. Wondering if anyone has fished it yet.
574761,Tonyo,2008-06-08 07:15:00,212,"Just got back from another great week on Gullrock. We stay at Five Lakes and were there from May 31 - June 6. Fishing was pretty good. We had high skys and a lot of sun while up. The walleye were in 16 - 20' of water, water temps were in the mid 50's and we found some walleyes around Fisherman's point, The Boot and Starrett Straight. Main bait of choice was a jig and minnow. Some crawlers and some Gulp Alive. The Gulp products were very slow for us. Minnows out fished every other bait we had with us, by far. I didn't do any Northern fishing while I was up but a couple of the others did with some success. Biggest walleye for our week was 27"" and the biggest northern 35"". TonyO."
574789,Guest,2008-06-09 07:31:00,0,"I was there with Tonyo. The catch was great, as usual, with more fish being caught in the 22"" plus than in the past 6 years, with 27"" being the largest. Dog's head was very productive in addition to what Tony listed. Our most productive spot for the larger fish was right across from Five Lakes Lodge. The river between the bridge and Five Lakes Lodge is worth some time if you want to try for a northern or two. Everett and Helen have Five Lakes Lodge looking as good as ever, were very helpful, and are a delight to be around. We didn't have to think twice about booking for next year. Let us know how your trip goes. Keep'er on hte bottom, JohnB.O.A.T."
574795,luv2fishcanada,2008-06-09 08:30:00,41,"Fished Gullrock out of Golden Hook Camp May 31-June6. Fishing was fantastic, 75+ a day. Our group of four had 13 over 25"" This was my 20th year fishing Gullrock out of Golden Hook Camp. Gullrock gets better and better every year. The only change is that Ranger Bay/Lake is now closed until June 15th every year. It used to only be closed the first two weeks of the season. If your looking for a great place to stay give Bill and Maureen a call."
574822,Guest,2008-06-09 16:14:00,0,"I've heard of a lot of different names for the same spot but I've never heard of the ""dogs head"". Where is that?"
574842,Guest,2008-06-09 21:32:00,0,I too have never heard of dogs head. Just wonder where it is. Say from the big flats near the gullrock
574867,Guest,2008-06-10 09:46:00,0,"Tackleman, Dog's Head, a.k.a Dog's dick.....It's on the opposite side of Gullrock Lake that the boot is located and just a little north. If you look at the map it looks like a dogs head with his ears flopping in the wind. Fish the south side, but only when the wind is blowing in. When I get to my map I'll give you a better description. But I'm sure you've been there before. Keep'er on the bottom. JohnB.O.A.T."
574892,Guest,2008-06-10 16:18:00,0,Ok I call that spot the eagles nest because about 18 years ago it had an eagles nest in an old dead tree when I first fished it. A lot of guys call it Iowa point. It's amazing the numberof different names people give the same spots.
574893,Guest,2008-06-10 16:25:00,0,I forgot to add that I took the wife out to fisherman's point sunday night and we got a number of walleye in the 18 to 24 foot range on hammered brass spinners but I also got them in the rocks just off the point in 13 feet. This morning I got them in 15 feet at stevenson's point. All this is catch and release.
