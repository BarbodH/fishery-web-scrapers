575146,Guest,2008-06-17 06:12:00,0,"Fished in the Miles Bay area last week and fishing was good but the wind was nasty. Caught fish in the 10'-20' of water. Caught a 25 & 27 "". They were just starting to take minnows. Fish were caught in the bay as well as quiet coves. Good luck."
575187,1shooter,2008-06-18 08:36:00,1493,">Thanks....any more specifics? What was working? Where were >they? Deep or still shallow? > >Thanks.... We had caught alot of decent fish in 16'-20' of water and the big ones were much shallower 8'-12'. As far as what we used on how we fished. We had 3 boats that used different bait and fished different. In my boat we simply used jigs and had the best luck with crawlers. The others used bottom bouncers with one boat using minnows and the other crawlers. We all had equal succes. The biggest eye was 27"" and several just under that."
574522,Matches,2008-05-31 14:44:00,236,"Hey Rgates, The 27"", 26"", 24"", 24"" and 23 sounds like Miles Bay fish to me. Could you go check to see how the lake trout are biting?"
574528,Guest,2008-05-31 17:34:00,0,No they were west of Miles Bay..........here are some fish photos in my journalhttp://buenavista.livejournal.com/ Yesterday I fished with 12 senior college football players who hadn't fished very much in their lives and one said this walleye fishing is as easy catching trout in those ponds where you go pay.............one of the guys ate 10 fillets for shorelunch. When I finished cooking there was nothing left to eat.....I have no idea how many fish we caught but it was constant all day..... And Skip those were fish caught and released...
574536,rockpt,2008-05-31 22:29:00,589,"Nice job, Rick. Now those guys think they should catch limits of trophy eyes everytime they go out. Spoiled for life. Post some of those shorelunch pics where you're cooking for a platoon...makes me tired just thinking about all the work involved."
575007,Guest,2008-06-12 22:35:00,0,Headed up to LOTW Sunday Any word on how Smokehouse or Miles Bay are doing? How are water temps and levels in that area?
575032,Obabikon,2008-06-13 12:29:00,2370,"The weather's been bad, but the fishing great. A ton of big fish this year. Lots of females over 27 inches are being pulled off the deep humps. (20-25 ft) Lunchers are in shallow (10-12 ft) on beaches. The weather's been bad, and the wind tough... but, the fishing has been making up for it!"
575058,nicko,2008-06-13 21:14:00,508,What's the weather been like...we are leaving in a week. What can we expect if it continues?
575064,Guest,2008-06-14 07:47:00,0,Got back from fishing LOTW Kenora early this week. Weather had been tough with temps in the 50's. A couple of days were rainy and windy. Only one day nice and sunny. New weed growth was hard to find and was told the weather has put it back by about two weeks. Seemed to find one or two walleye at most spots but had to keep moving to find the schools. Bass were getting ready to spawn with the males close to shore waiting for the females to come in. Wingmann
575069,Guest,2008-06-14 09:02:00,0,Any new reports?
575076,Obabikon,2008-06-14 12:52:00,2370,"Yesterday was pretty ugly (weather wise)... today is great! Mid-low 70's, south west wind at 7mph. A beautiful day! The fishing is still going great! Walleyes are being caught deep and shallow on just about everything. The small mouth are going crazy in the evenings, the big fat footballs are a ton of fun."
575125,1shooter,2008-06-16 16:39:00,1493,Just got back today after 4 days of fishing in the Miles Bay area. Fishing was good and the weather was tolerable.
574422,Guest,2008-05-29 11:15:00,0,Going up in a week and would like to hear how the fishing/weather has been. Will be in the northern part of LOTW but would like to hear any reports on that Lake. Used to fish out of the Morson area a few years back so I know a little about this area and would welcome any fishing news around there or anywher on LOTW. Thanks for your responses. Gotta get my fix since the trip is getting so close I can taste it. Wingamnn17
574424,rockpt,2008-05-29 12:17:00,589,There are some reports on the Canada section of fishingminnesota.com.
574425,MN_Moose,2008-05-29 12:19:00,965,Hey Wingamnn We will be going up there too week from Fri. Same part of LOTW. We stay at Smith's. Sounds like shallow is the ticket. Fishing MN is good check out Witch Bay site also.
574435,Guest,2008-05-29 16:00:00,0,"Hey Moose, I'll be on Longbow next Saturday, how do you like Smith's camp ?? JJ"
574449,Guest,2008-05-29 21:02:00,0,"I guided wednesday and thursday and caught about 70 walleyes each day - wednesday we caught a 27"", 26"", 24"", 24"" and 23 and today a 38 inch northern. We Fished near North Island with 3/4 oz. jigs and minnows in about 18ft. Some of the fish still had spawn in them.....We were stopped by the guys doing the fish survey and they weighed, measured, and took a scale, and fin bone. I'll brag and report that they said our fish were the nicest bunch they had seen all day.............."
574471,MN_Moose,2008-05-30 08:23:00,965,>We Fished near North Island with 3/4 >oz. jigs and minnows in about 18ft. Where's North Island? Near town? JJ we really like Smith's camp. We'll look for you out there. I'm in a 19 ft tan & green alumacraft with a Honda.
574490,PJM,2008-05-30 12:48:00,3516,Rgate You are a typically fishing guide. Was it 70 fish in the boat or did that 70 include bites also?
574502,Guest,2008-05-30 16:26:00,0,Thanks for the info everyone. We will be at Witchbay camp and have been hearing that the fish are starting to come into the shallows. Anyone else have any reports? How about you Obabikon? Care to tell some fishing stories? Wingmann
574512,rockpt,2008-05-30 22:11:00,589,"Hey PJM, That 70 included fish Rick marked on his sonar.:rotflmao: Nice job Rick. You're the man.:bowdown: When are we going to see you this year Skip? We're up July 25-Aug. 3 and Oct. 3-12. We got some catchin' up to do."
574515,MN_Moose,2008-05-31 08:01:00,965,Figured out that North Island is down South near Morson.
