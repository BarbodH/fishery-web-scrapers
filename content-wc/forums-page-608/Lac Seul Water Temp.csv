575126,BenBeattie,2008-06-16 16:56:00,232,anywhere from 54-60deg. Supposed to get sunny the next 4 days so we'll watch it shoot up to the mid 60's and the walleye bite should really get going.
575128,Mike Kansas,2008-06-16 18:21:00,1463,Just got back from fishing north shore last week. Had tough time finding temps on main lake above 49 degrees. Late in week it got up to 53 degrees. Should be warming up and getting better when I go back 1st week of July. Mike Kansas
