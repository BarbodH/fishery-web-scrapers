Had my eye set on a high tech vacuum cleaner, but this seems so much more personal, and has heirloom hand-me-down potential as well.. What a surprise will be in store. Many thanks, eyecatcher!! Bill"

I missed mine for the first time in 30 years, but I will survive. Enjoy this time now with your families (not sure if Canadians can or not) and remember what this season is all about. Lets hope and pray that a year from now we will be back to normal and this will all be a bad dream. Merry Christmas All! I hope you have some new fishing stuff under the tree!"
