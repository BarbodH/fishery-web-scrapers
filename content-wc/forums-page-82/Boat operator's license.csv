6512670,Bobby Winds,2020-12-31 08:18:00,10817,"No, that's MUCH older than the required Waterfowl Identification Course/Card."
6512672,Huntindave,2020-12-31 08:26:00,2194,Do you have a reference link for this requirement? I waterfowl hunt Federal land and water all the time and have never been asked for this.
6512680,Bobby Winds,2020-12-31 08:32:00,10817,"Here's just on avenue to the course.........It's REQUIRED for us to obtain Duck Blinds during the season PLUS Hunting license, Duck Stamp and HIP #https://www.dec.ny.gov/outdoor/92272.html"
6512690,Huntindave,2020-12-31 08:46:00,2194,"This course is required to get an access permit for select National Wildlife Refuges and state lands open to waterfowl hunting. While this course is not required for waterfowl hunting in general, it is recommended and of value to attend. So this course is in fact NOT required for Federal lands, only for a few select tracts. That explains why it has never been a requirement on the Federal land and water I'm hunting. You need to be a bit more specific, when you make such a broad statement."
6512692,Bobby Winds,2020-12-31 08:48:00,10817,It's required on ALL federal waterfall hunting areas in NYS.
6512714,Huntindave,2020-12-31 09:55:00,2194,"Not what you said earlier. Like I said, your statement was incorrect as stated."
6512838,kzoofisher,2020-12-31 20:01:00,5144,"I think he's still incorrect and what he means is that it's required on National Wildlife Refuges on Long Island. Not that it matters much, almost all the non DOD Federal land in NY is on Long Island and the little bit elsewhere is mostly National Parks and Monuments. There's only about 44,000 acres owned by the Forest or Fish & Wildlife Services and a good chunk of that doesn't even allow the public without a special permit. Most of the duck hunting areas are lottery draws. As I went down the rabbit hole looking into this I was shocked to learn how little public land there is in NY. It's really quite pathetic. About 1 million acres of State Forest and Wildlife management areas and another 900,000 of private land with easements that allow some sorts of recreation but not all and 3 million of Forest Preserve most of which is in the Catskills region. By contrast Michigan has 3.6 million acres of Federal and 4.8 million acres of State land that is wide open to fishing and hunting across both peninsulas to go along with hunting easements on private land throughout the southern part of the State. And of course, there's twice as many people in NY as there are in Michigan. The more I learn about that state the happier I am not to live there. Not saying you couldn't pay me to live there, but I bet you couldn't afford it."
6512870,Bobby Winds,2021-01-01 04:43:00,10817,Wrong again.
6512878,kzoofisher,2021-01-01 05:48:00,5144,"Which part? And show your work, your credibility is not great on this. The course is required for playing duck bingo, not for men who put in the work to find their own spots."
6512526,Obabikon,2020-12-30 16:25:00,2370,"You obviously do not own a business. If a bartender serves someone alcohol, and that person drives. Can they be held responsible? If your business knowingly allows someone to break the law... you better believe that the Government will be cracking down on the business. They will come down on the business much harder than they will the individual breaking the law. Governments (especially the Canadian government) have been heading this direction for years. They are forcing businesses to enforce their laws, or be held responsible. They do this, because it is easier than having a large police force."
6512528,v-bay gord,2020-12-30 16:47:00,3168,"Not sure that is the case. If, and that is a big if, the law requires a boater to have a ""boaters card"", I believe it will be up to the boater to prove that, or face a fine. Similarly I have no control over a guest who wants to have booze on board one of my boats. I may tell them it is illegal, but in the end the person getting the ticket will be the guest not me. If somebody arrives at my camp and says they already have a fishing license it is not up to me to prove this. If they also say they have a boaters card well then it will likely be the same....till someone proves differently. In all the years I have been filling out the G.D. boater rental forms I have yet to have a guest say they had to show this piece of paper. It is worthless, and I think we all know that."
6512540,RichA$1970,2020-12-30 17:22:00,1159,I feel for the owners on all the red tape they have to deal with especially since I fish on single outpost only lake operating a basic 14’ camp boat & 8hp outboard. If someone could please post if or when this becomes a law and what is needed to meet the requirements for Manitoba and Ontario I’d appreciate it.

6512646,eyecatcher1,2020-12-31 06:27:00,323,I live in Minnesota and never had a boating card until a year or so ago when my granddaughter started selling insurance. She told me that if I take the online class and get the card that I'd get a discount on my boat insurance. That made it worth it for me. The class is easy especially if you've been operating a boat for a while.
6512660,Bobby Winds,2020-12-31 08:02:00,10817,"Yes, this is true but it's not very much of a savings........I am SURE it's under $10 when I forgot to mention it and then called my insurance company to add this discount. So what's next in CanaDA...maybe you will need a Fish Identification Course in order to buy a fishing license. Duck hunters have had to get a Waterfowl Card DECADES ago to hunt Federal lands when waterfowl hunting. Might not be a bad idea to protect the resources. Happy New Year, Bob"
6512662,Huntindave,2020-12-31 08:09:00,2194,"?????? Are you referring to a ""duck stamp""?"
6512410,v-bay gord,2020-12-30 08:38:00,3168,"A number of years ago a law was enacted that all rental boats needed to provide life jackets. I remember the gnashing of teeth from many resorts....doom and gloom. Seems silly now. The current boat rental checklist requirement seems to put the onus on the resort operator. If the system changes to having your own boating card then it's up to the guest. I will still go over the basics of operating ""my"" boat. As long as the process for a guest to obtain a card from their respective state is simple, quick and easy then I'm fine with it. There would need to be some lag time to implement it to get everyone up to speed."

""what's that""? Who's in charge of walking them through an online course at the last second so their entire trip isn't ruined?

The government is not the ones that will be enforcing the law... they will force resorts and marinas to enforce the law. They won't even do it by giving us a reward... they will simply threaten us with punishment to get us to do what they want. I guarantee that boat or slip rentals without confirming boat safety card will result in fines. On top of that... every single law that is passed makes it just a little more difficult to convince someone to travel. I'm not saying this is the end of the world or that resorts will lose everything because of this.

Still have 5+ months before any boats are launched. 2). Nothing is official yet that I have seen. 3). Still not sure if there will be entry for 2021. 4). The customer should reach out to the camp owner once there is an entry plan that this should be raised- I know many don’t and the complain to the owner and think it’s their fault. 5). Like many have posted, go to your state’s natural resource website and take an on-line free boater safety course. Won’t hurt and pack it with your Canada card. Hopefully this is a requirement, they put a warning on the fishing license website to let everyone know what is required and what will be accepted."

If a resort owner reminds you that you must have a Pleasure Craft Operators Card and you go boating without one anyways, it's on you! Either for making a poor decision at the time or coming unprepared. I'm sure that resort owners let folks know when making reservations that the law may have changed.....that's a courtesy not a requirement."
6512506,biggamefisher,2020-12-30 15:19:00,540,"Sorry, no compassion from me............cost of doing business! How can they fine you for something that is not legislated? What is legislated, is needing a Pleasure Craft Operators Card to operate certain boats, failure to do so is an offence. It's not legislated that you can't rent a boat to someone without a card, that you can't rent a slip to someone without a card...it just isn't. Citizens do not have the authority to enforce laws, that's up to sworn officials!"
6512510,Pickypickerel,2020-12-30 15:36:00,151,Canada doesn't have DNR its called MNR I'm surprised you didn't know that being from Winnipeg ?
6512512,Huntindave,2020-12-30 15:38:00,2194,"Please go rent a car to use without presenting a drivers license to the rental company. Go ahead, loan your car to someone who does not have a drivers license. Insurance companies will not cover you under those circumstances (ask your agent) and you will be just as liable as your customer, if anything, anything, happens. As a resort, are you willing to take that risk for a total stranger?"
6512522,Obabikon,2020-12-30 16:19:00,2370,"Not looking for compassion. However... jumping through endless government hoops is only the cost of doing business if you allow it to be. So, that's why I disagree with ADDITIONAL government BS! On top of HST, payroll, social insurance, ei, property tax and more basic government programs that we need to adhere to as a business... if you sell live bait, there's a permit for that. You have to log the number of minnows in and out of your resort. You then must identify any unusual species that are sold to you. If you sell gas, you have to log how much gas goes in each boat, the boat ID number, and the day it was filled. If you have food on the premises or alcohol on the premises there's a slew of other permits and requirements to adhere to. Not to mention fishing licenses and such. MoE, MNR, MoF... we deal with enough. I will fight every single additional law that I believe has no use. I do not believe for one second that a boater safety card will keep jerks from being jerks. I also do not believe a boater safety card will make new boaters safe. If they want to do that... start minimizing boat sizes. Anyone operating a boat larger than 16' with a motor bigger than 50HP requires proof. I'd be fine with that. However, that's not what is being suggested."

If you don't -- you should have weather it's required or not. Ontario does not profit from your getting a card that is recognized in the US. The point is boater safety not profit.

6512382,biggamefisher,2020-12-30 07:26:00,540,"What work? The resort may remind you dockside of the rule changes, that's no work at all! Currently the resort if providing a rental boat, needs to perform a dockside rental checklist with the renter if they don't have the Pleasure Craft Operators Card. If these new rules come into effect, they won't have to do that as everyone would need to have the Pleasure Craft Operators Card anyway. So, in fact if the rule changes come to fruition, it's less work for the resort!"
6512386,Pickypickerel,2020-12-30 07:33:00,151,That doesn't surprise me. They haven't even lifted a finger to help the resorts for all business lost in 2020 at all !!!
6512402,CI_Guy,2020-12-30 08:13:00,2118,It will force the resort owners to enforce the law. Instead of quickly going over a checklist it puts them in an adversarial position with some unprepared and belligerent customers. Resort owners like all business owners don't want to be forced to argue with their customers.
