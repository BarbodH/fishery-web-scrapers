But I can recall talking to a guy who went there and really enjoyed the trip. That's about what I can give You on mcconnel. I did go with George to Sherlock, I think it was Sherlock maybe Sherwood. It's a small lake, it's been around 20 years ago, but we caught lots of fish, nothing of great size. Got a bit boring with such a small lake though."

6509710,fsz,2020-12-20 14:54:00,144,"Neighbor of mine uses Ivanhoe and has said good things. He fished lemoine I think and maybe little lemoine. I looked into McConnell myself. My impression was it is mostly a bass and pike lake decent numbers but size kinda small plus walleye were definitely not the dominant species. The lakes up there will have one fish or another which dominates over the others. Again, Ivanhoe has a top-notch reputation but unless you want to fish primarily for small-medium pike and bass (albeit in good number) McConnell might not be the lake for you."
6509724,[email protected],2020-12-20 15:47:00,13,Thanks for the info. I will look into it further.
6509894,[email protected],2020-12-21 09:11:00,13,"Hi FSZ, How did you learn that Pike are the dominant species? I haven't heard that from any of my inquiries. Not that I am doubting you, just curious where that came from and I would like to know what lake would be recommended for some newbies to catch Walleye in the first week of July? We are aiming for numbers of fish over size. We are a little concerned over having too much water to search in a week just based on our one other experience together. Thanks for the insight!"
6510084,fsz,2020-12-21 18:41:00,144,"A thousand apologies. I just double checked and I made a mistake. The lake I was describing is Forearm, not McConnel! So sorry !!! just trying to help out! I actually have 2 neighbors that have used Ivanhoe (they go with separate groups) and between their stories and my research I got confused. The above said- the search function on this site works well. I also called the MNR office in Chapleu to inquire on some of the lakes, they emailed me information on lakes in that region. Also there is website from Ontario that has info. If you google âfish ON-lineâ you get to a data base to research lakes. I tried looking up McConnel on that site and no info on that lake. It took some patience to end up speaking with someone at the Chapleau MNR office but once I got the right person (field biologist I think) they were pretty helpful."
6510094,[email protected],2020-12-21 19:03:00,13,"Thanks for the reply, We have gotten a little bit of first hand info. Most people confirm that Ivanhoe is a top notch operation. The few that we have heard from who have fished McConnell say that we will catch lots of fish. No monsters but, lots of small fish. That is what we are after. Not that we are aiming for small fish..... but, amount of fish is far more important than size. Thanks again for your info, no need for an apology we all make mistakes. I appreciate your honesty. Depending on how this pandemic works out..... if we are able to go..... I will let you know how it goes."
6510212,gordy28,2020-12-22 10:18:00,437,Not sure if you found this thread but I had it book marked as I may take a short trip this year and was looking at Air Ivanhoe as its a fairly short drive from where I live in the Greater Toronto Area There is mention of McConnell in the thread https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum....php?p=6331814 Cheers Andrew
6510218,[email protected],2020-12-22 10:33:00,13,"Hey Thanks Andrew, I hadn't seen all these comments. I appreciate it. Every bit of info helps. The buddy whose 70th b-day we are celebrating wants to have a good week of shore lunches and relatively consistent action. I have a cottage 3 hours north east of Toronto and my buddy comes a couple times a year and we enjoy a few meals of perch but, most importantly we are catching fish regularly. He is hoping for something similar to that just with larger fish. So if he is getting 14""-18"" Walleye and a few hammer handles... I think the trip will be worthwhile for him. Thanks again!"
6505788,[email protected],2020-12-08 20:48:00,13,"Hello Everyone, I was given the suggestion to post my question here. So thanks to all for your help thus far. Has anyone fished McConnell Lake outpost with Air Ivanhoe before? I have tentatively reserved this outpost for July 3-10 of 2021. I have a good friend celebrating his 70th birthday in 2021 and he has taking a flyin on his bucket list. Two years ago, he joined me at a drive in lodge on a large lake approximately 100 miles west of McConnell and either we suck tremendously or the fishing just wasn't as advertised. After spending the last few months trying to decide what outfitter to use, we have decided on Ivanhoe. I thought we would have people chomping at the bit to go but I was wrong.... so after George suggested with our limited experience we should go to Bromley. We have switched to McConnell because Bromley has a minimum of 4 people. McConnell has a minimum of 2 people. McConnell is a very small lake. Our problem two years ago seemed that we were stymied by inexperience and a huge amount of water to learn in 7 days. We are hoping that we can get close to the 25 fish per day per guy if there is less water to search. Any experience on McConnell? Sorry for the long winded question and explanation. Just want my buddy to have the best experience possible. Any advice on this lake would be appreciated. Thanks."

Don't worry about learning an entire lake at once. Big or small.I wish you good luck, but you can make your own luck by doing what you are doing and asking questions like this. Most of the time it takes a couple trips or more to get familiar with any lake. Everyone is the same in that regard.Pooch"
6505822,RichA$1970,2020-12-09 05:18:00,1159,"As she said, “How small (lake) is it?”I’m leery of the fly ins that put you on a private lake that is like 2m x 1m as they are easy to navigate but are you limited to 14” fish. Most outfitters all say excellent fishing with trophies but the reality is that’s their advertising as there’s always a chance. I’d look at the lake map, depth, structure and feeder creeks to form a plan. Does it have bays and islands?Not sure where you are based but I’d go northwest n look for at least a 4,000 acre lake that might have a river system flowing into it. You still might do great there n having a lake to yourself is awesome with a good friend."
6505834,[email protected],2020-12-09 06:49:00,13,Sorry for the lack of clarity. I was hoping to get first hand experience on this lake. I have chosen a very small lake with a fly in just because we failed miserably last time on a huge lake. This small lake is approximately 2 miles long and a half a mile wide at the widest point. It has three islands one of which has the only cabin on the lake. There is one noticeable bay that is 150 yards wide and deep. I haven't yet been able to get a depth contour map. First thoughts are to bottom bounce 1/4 ounce jig heads with crawlers around each of the islands from the 6 - 15 feet in depth. Troll shorelines just before dark with perch mimicking cranks.
6505956,kim n indiana,2020-12-09 10:28:00,62,"i did McConnell last year. toward end of August. from camp, caught fish straight across around islands. also down to right is shallow rocky section marked with some buoys. kind of an extension of the row of islands. straight off dock is weed bed. if you want to mess around there is little fish in there. pike and smallies. also caught smallies on back side of cabin island around all the big rocks there. Look at the notebook at main lodge. about 20 marked maps there with fishing spots. have fun. we may get back if i can talk baby daughter into going."
6506134,[email protected],2020-12-09 21:19:00,13,"Sorry folks just getting to know the site. Thanks for the tips. We have chosen a smaller lake due to our poor performance on a larger lake (mistake or not..... time will tell). My experience on the larger lake made us think to scale back not only on lake size but the amount of fishing pressure. This larger lake was advertised as ""very remote, little fishing pressure and 60-100 walleye per day"" We fished all the so called hot-spots I had even found folks who had experience at this outfitter and took advice from them. We were up at 4:00 am and on the water by 5:00 everyday, we fished till around noon. We came in for lunch and right back to the water. Two of our party of six were completely skunked for the week ( sorry one of those guys reeled in a crayfish). I caught the most fish with approximately 30-40 fish for the week with two nice walleye at 19 inches. This was a 7 day trip. I don't know if going the route that we have chosen will give us a better experience but I hope so. All the reports that I hear about Air Ivanhoe say that they run a good operation. There has been a few negative fishing reports. Is that just because there are others out there that lack the experience that my party and I lack? Maybe..... I guess we jumped on the idea of a fly in with this idea that if you fly into a lake that can't be accessed any other way, you would catch fish until your arms fall off? Maybe this is just part of the learning process? We are tentatively booked for McConell with Ivanhoe. I think that we will likely go through with it. I truly hope that my friend gets the experience that he is hoping for. Maybe our expectations are just a little high to start with?"

6506338,Guest,2020-12-10 14:42:00,0,"Through trial and error, It did not take me long to find out, you want good fly in fishing, further North you go, equals better fishing. Foleyet is not far enough. Do the drive, spend the dough. You will not be dissapointed"
