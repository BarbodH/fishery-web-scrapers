You can get the floating jighead design in the 1/2"" size which is nearly impossible to find these days.http://www.jacksjigs.com will bring you to the site. I always wondered if any tackle manufacturer had ever bought the design from Binkelman's family. These are not exact replicas, but the closest I have found. I still have 5 or 6 of Bill Binkelman's old 'Nightcrawler Secrets' books, which I still refer to often."
