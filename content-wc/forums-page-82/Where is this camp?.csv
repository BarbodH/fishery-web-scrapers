6512082,stumcfar,2020-12-29 07:55:00,451,http://www.rickmotter.com/pipestone/ This is an old link I found. Maybe some of the pics might jog your memory if this is the place.
6512842,Quattroman,2020-12-31 20:41:00,6,"Hi All!Thank you all so much for your feedback/ideas/suggestions, links, etc. So far the north pipestone portage looks the most familiar. I know we could not see the other side due to it being on a hill. I looked at Yoke Lake and how we could have done the walking portage from Pipestone to Yoke, then took the boat ride to the camp at the far east of Yoke. Slippery Winds may be the place. And behind Slippery Winds is Straw Lake. Could still be like finding a needle in a haystack, but I will contact them to see if they have some more history to share with me. After I talk with them and if it's the resort I went to with my dad I will let you all know. Mike"
6513266,Quattroman,2021-01-02 11:13:00,6,It may be Yoke. Thanks for the response!
6513272,Quattroman,2021-01-02 11:21:00,6,"Thanks for your response, and the links. After getting more responses, the portage I took really looks more like the one on the north end of Pipestone lake. It's been fun looking at all the possibilities. Thanks again!"
6513274,Quattroman,2021-01-02 11:25:00,6,"Thank you, I think that portage on the north end of Pipestone looks the most familiar so far! South end not really. I appreciate the feedback!"
6513276,Quattroman,2021-01-02 11:31:00,6,"Thank you for your response. Yes, it was an American Plan, and it is hard to say if it still would be that now. I don't know why I remember the spiral staircase to our cabin/sleeping quarters....but it sure seems to be what I remember. And whether that spiral staircase was changed over the years....who knows."
6513532,elkman99,2021-01-03 10:48:00,180,Thats great! Hope you get to go back up there soon!
6514102,Hillbiehle,2021-01-05 10:47:00,66,"Part of what you described sounds like Lac La Croix on the Minnesota / Canadian Border. Do you remember checking into Canada via boat at the Sand Point Rangers Station to cross Canadian Border. You may have entered from Crane Lake, MN, hopped in a boat, checked in at Sand Point Lake ranger station/Ontario Entry and then proceeded to Little Vermillion Lake, down the Loon River then over the rail to Loon Lake and then again a rail portage to Lac La Croix. Possible resort could have been Zups or Campbells."
6511402,Quattroman,2020-12-27 11:15:00,6,"I am trying to find a resort I went to with my dad in 1976. I was 16. My dad passed in 1994. We are from Minnesota and the resort must have been somewhere in Ontario. We drove our car to a spot near (I don’t remember crossing the border but maybe) where we parked the car, jumped into a boat driven by someone for roughly 1/2 to 1 hour. We then took that boat over land on a automatic mechanical portage. Then drove that boat again for a period of time. Then they dropped us off and we walked with our gear with a couple guides for roughly another half hour then jumped in another boat to the resort. Obviously very remote. I believe our sleeping quarters was up a spiral staircase. I think. And had bunk beds a bathroom and that’s about it. All meals were served in the main lodge. Because the trek in was difficult for my dad we got to take a float plane out when we left. Also, we could fish in a lake that was right out front of the resort, but I remember if we wanted to take a walk in back of the resort there was another lake back there. Also, I remember another family was there with a kid my age from Minnesota and had the common name of John Anderson. How many of those in Minnesota!! If anyone has any ideas of what resort this may possibly be, please let me know. I would appreciate it."
6511418,elkman99,2020-12-27 12:27:00,180,Sounds like maybe Yoke lake off the Pipestone chain? Don't think you have to go over 2 portages though. http://slipperywinds.com/ is the lodge on Yoke now.
6511510,LakeNipissing,2020-12-27 15:36:00,18,"The only place I know in around these parts that sounds like that is the old marine rail portage connecting Biscotasing lake with Indian lake.https://www.google.ca/maps/place/Bis...1!4d-82.103336There's a youtube view of it herehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CKunBKF96kIt's remote alright, most Northerners don;t even know about it. These are good sized lakes and Bisco only has a couple of landings while Indian has none that you can drive to anymore, and might have had camps back in the days.hope it helps"
6511574,jackpotjohnny48,2020-12-27 17:29:00,153,"And here's some footage I shot of the Pipestone portage. I don't know if this looks familiar to you or not, but I'm guessing there aren't too many places in NW Ontario that have this type of portage. (There are a couple different portages like this on the Pipestone / Clearwater chain if I'm not mistaken, although I've only been on the north portage - the one that connects Clearwater to Pipestone) Does this look familiar to you at all?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qB8n_ef7vqU"
6511586,jackpotjohnny48,2020-12-27 17:46:00,153,"My other guess (other than Pipestone) might be Lake Despair. I have never been on Lake Despair, but I believer that you can get there from Clearwater lake via what they call the south portage. (The north portage takes you to Pipestone Lake). If I'm not mistaken, the south portage, at the south end of Clearwater (aka Burditt), takes you into the Manomin River, and then from there you would continue further south into Lake Despair. Note: I've never been on the south portage, but I've heard that it's somewhat similar to the north portage, in that it is somewhat like a railroad car that you drive your boat onto, and then your boat is portaged to the next lake. So, maybe you went to Lake Despair via Clearwater? Or maybe Jackfish Lake?"
6511596,jackpotjohnny48,2020-12-27 17:54:00,153,"Ok, I found pics of both the north and south portages on Clearwater Lake. If you watch this video beginning at 2 minutes and 20 seconds, continuing on to about the 3-minute mark, you will see both the north and south railroad portages on the Pipestone / Clearwater / Jackfish / Despair chain.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4qu_a_1zjY"
6511600,Eckohlt,2020-12-27 18:04:00,3685,"Keep in mind the guy where ever he ended up,it sounds like it was America plan with meals n had a lodge there"
6511622,jackpotjohnny48,2020-12-27 18:50:00,153,Oops. I didn't see that part the first time I read the OP. That would probably rule out West Jackfish. I know Pipestone has a few American Plan lodges - not sure whether or not that was the case back in 1976
6511882,Bill Krejca,2020-12-28 16:10:00,6107,"I was thinking the Pipestone Lake. At the straight north end, there was a camp, which I believe burned down a few years ago, they used to advertise quite frequently. They has access to another walleye lake which was walked into somewhat north of the camp, again, if i remember correctly. I never stayed there, but took a run west of there, and camped for 3-4 days back in the 1980's? Good trout fishing in Scistose Lake. Bill"
6511884,jackpotjohnny48,2020-12-28 16:26:00,153,"The name of the resort that burned down was Happy Landing. They were situated in Thompson Bay of Pipestone, and they portaged their guests into lakes such as Straw, Sucan, and Yoke, among a few other lakes. So they shared some water with Pipestone Lodge, and shared some other water with Slippery Winds."
