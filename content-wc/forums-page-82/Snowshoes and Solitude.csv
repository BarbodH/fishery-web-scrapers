Here I used to think/not think much, that log cabins, et al, were an American idea, new to humanity! How naïve we can be! Merry Christmas!! Bill"
6510730,That Minnesota guy,2020-12-24 07:51:00,8293,Bill. it's kinda why many parts of the world hate the united states. We think the world is part of us instead of us being part of the world.
6510774,wmd,2020-12-24 10:02:00,388,There is a whole lot of truth in that statement. wmd
6510784,pjshorthorn,2020-12-24 10:15:00,5654,"I've yet to meet a single person who has said that their entire family lineage is 100% American. How easily we all forget where our families came from. I look forward to the day when I can go to Scotland ,Ireland , Wales and Germany to trace some history of my lineage. PjShorthorn"
6510206,Carnhzkr,2020-12-22 09:49:00,964,Have you seen this? I stumbled upon it this morning. This is Les Stroud's (aka Survivor Man) first film. He and his wife spent a year in the Wabakimi so it's filled with beautiful Canadian wilderness footage. I think I'll ask my wife if she will do this with me.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U80WZf7OqRw&t=1887s
6510246,gordy28,2020-12-22 12:52:00,437,Love that video as well as most of Les's stuff - I have watched all of his Survivorman stuff too If you like that check out Joe Robinet and Shawn James/My Self Reliance on youtube - been lovng there stuff this winter Cheers Andrew
6510312,pjshorthorn,2020-12-22 16:47:00,5654,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idqjaYG_AHwThis is another one I enjoy. It is called The Outsider.Lots of videos on a father and son building a log cabin in the Canadian bush by themselves. There are quite a few episodes that are 25-30 minutes each on average. There might be 30-40 episodes ( maybe more). It would be a good winter binge watch when one has the time...LOL. I love the detail that they go into on how they are building this large cabin from the ground up. They are currently at drying in the cabin with the roof going on.PjShorthorn
6510316,Mojo-NC,2020-12-22 17:16:00,1929,"I'll have to check it out. I'm sure my wife would love me to do that - without her! If y'all like the survival shows, check out Alone. I've watched almost all of it and am amazed how tough and ingenious these men and women are while enduring the most difficult conditions imaginable. To survive under these conditions for 90 day or more takes some serious outdoor survival knowledge and skills to match."
6510318,v-bay gord,2020-12-22 17:20:00,3168,"I don't quite get the purpose of the experience. Apparently they liked it. I think part of liking it was to gain some notoriety. The scenery was great, but I can find that here and have a shower every day and not eat off of a stick. But to each there own. PJ......here's a great video that shows some old time skills that you will appreciate.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNTfLGt59qo"
6510322,That Minnesota guy,2020-12-22 17:49:00,8293,"Thanks Gord, those are some craftsmen! They can handle a axe, I'd be walking around on one leg."
6510430,Stringbean,2020-12-23 07:25:00,279,"That's way to much work for me. I'll just sit back on the porch of the cottage that I rented for a week and enjoy a cold one. After all, sitting in a boat catching all these fish is strenuous. I'm retired! I'm not going to work that hard."
6510458,Pooch,2020-12-23 08:22:00,4618,"The time spent watching that video was time well spent. Growing up on a farm surrounded by immigrants from German, Sweden, and everything in between I was always amazed at everyone's ingenuity. Later I realized that they all brought skill sets with them from their former homes. We did, like all small communities have guys who specialized on something, whether they were blacksmiths, cabinet makers, well diggers, shop owners, butchers, etc.. I've still got our old cast iron butchering pots and frames, hand pounded hitch pins, etc.. laying around in sheds. Cool stuff and invaluable to me. Today's world is so vanilla compared to back then. Though I'm not sure I'd want to return to those days. The good old days weren't always that good. That part I do remember. Thanks and Merry Christmas to everyone. Pooch"
6510476,RichA$1970,2020-12-23 08:53:00,1159,"This is becoming a lost art and it is really nice to watch. Although the log cabins are nice, from a maintenance perspective I’d put up a pole barn any day over the log cabin. My dad and I have built 3 polebarns on the farm with another trapper’s cabin planned n lucky to have a neighbor down the road who runs a sawmill so it works well with him on trading downed trees from the ice storms in return for the lumber. Tin roofs are the way to go n I do t miss shingles one bit. Still a cool video if you have the time and skill."
6510694,pjshorthorn,2020-12-24 05:02:00,5654,Now I know where the rustic look of the cabins at the lodge come from !!! How far along are you with building PJ's Pad on Otter Lake ? PjShorthorn
