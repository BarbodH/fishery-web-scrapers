6513374,dvl2700,2021-01-02 15:34:00,371,"While it may be a power and money grab, any boater education class makes some sense. As a Marine Deputy in Michigan many years ago, the only boating accidents we had were with drunken boaters. Averaged about two or three a year, and all involved injuries. Last year near Kalamazoo MI a drunken boater tried to go under a bridge and killed his two passengers who were also drunk. They made it under on the way out going slow, but going on plane when they were coming back they were too high. Most of the boating accidents are caused by speed, inattentiveness and alcohol. Worse thing is giving a person a high powered boat when they have no experience in a boat. Not sure other than the alcohol how much is effected by some camp boats that have a 15hp on them."
6513852,MrSimon,2021-01-04 13:43:00,922,"I don't see how it's a money grab at all .... the majority of the boater licenses will be obtained by U.S. citizens in the states. None of that money goes to the Canadian gov't. Of course boater education is a good thing, but the way they are going about it does not actually promote true boater education that will result in safer waterways. But it WILL result in annoyed guests, frustrated camp owners, and maybe even lower revenues for the camps. But hey, some politician can toot his own horn and say he's ""doing his part to make Canada safer""."

The tag on the PFD will state its' type and any restrictions (e.g., if it needs to be worn). NOTE: In spite of what the regulations may allow, I advocate always wearing a life vest and purchased an inflatable to make that easier to do so. This is from the Mustang HIT manual. ""APPROVAL CONDITIONS* AND* CARRIAGE* REQUIREMENTS Recreational - Approved for recreational use by the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) as a Type II (Model MD3183), or Type V (Model MD3184) Personal Flotation Device (PFD). Neither are approved for water skiing or other high impact, high-speed activities. Model MD3184 has Type II performance but is approved as a Type V PFD because it has a built-in sailing harness that can cause injury if not properly used. A separate section titled SAILING HARNESS (p. 13) discusses requirements and features on the MD3184 only. USCG approval does not apply to the sailing harness because some of the risks associated with its use have not been evaluated.

The coast guard auxiliary started to get involved for safety. Boat owners could have a free boat inspection for safety items on their boat once a year. With that safety sticker on your boat the coast guard would not stop you but without that sticker showing you had been previously been inspected they would stop you and do a on water inspection!

It also will do nothing to mitigate boating risks. Most of the major boating accidents I hear about on LOTW's are involving locals and guides. I would guess that more than 80% of boaters do not have the boater course, and that's why 80% of accidents the people don't have a card. I have taken a course, and it has done nothing to help my boater safety. Wear life jackets, give wide births to other boaters, slow down in shallow areas.... be cautious.

6508144,Guest,2020-12-15 08:28:00,0,i think this is a great idea. but it should be expanded as long as they are doing it. at all busy boat launches have the boat operator check for a boaters license before he is allowed to launch. also have everyone aboard the boat wear a life jacket at all times. plus require everyone in the boat to pass a swimming test. outlaw all alcohol in the country.

6508210,MrSimon,2020-12-15 10:30:00,922,"I dislike regulations that are poorly designed, cause more hassle than benefit, and don't actually solve problems. I recently took the Pennsylvania boater safety course and got my little blue card. The test is a joke. It's all on the computer. It's easy, the answers are right in front of you, there is no personal instruction or on-water training. The test does not provide any lasting instruction, knowledge, or training. The test does absolutely nothing to reduce boating accidents. The test does nothing to increase on-water safety. If someone in the Canadian government thinks that little blue card indicates the holder is a knowledgeable, trained, and safe boater ..... they're an idiot. Classic example of regulation for the sake of regulating."
6508212,Donscs,2020-12-15 10:34:00,379,"Back in 1988 I took a couple of courses put on by the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary; it was part of their Boating Skills and Seamanship Courses. I completed the Piloting and Marine Engine Courses. I wonder if this would satisfy the requirements for Canada if they pass this legislation. Doubt the Marine Engine course would mean much since I can hardly figure out how to take the cowling off my Verado, but I would think the Piloting course would count for something. I've held on to the certificate stating I passed the courses because it gets me a discount on my boat insurance."
6508220,MrSimon,2020-12-15 10:46:00,922,"One more thought. If you are going to compare boater safety cards to driver's licenses, then you need to look at the requirements of getting a driver's license. You have to pass a multi-week on-road instructional class, log hundreds of in-car hours with a seasoned driver, pass a written test, and then pass an on-road test with a government employee. You see, THAT'S an example of regulation designed to instill knowledge in the driver and reduce accidents. If you TRULY want safer waterways, you'd push for that level of certification. Truth is though, the Canadian waterways are already pretty darn safe. Additional regulation is not supported by any data."
6507860,Ndstallmann,2020-12-14 12:45:00,549,"I have been fishing , anchored on lot of lakes, that nobody seem to know the 300ft. rule. Maybe a class would help about half the idiots."

What % of boating deaths were alcohol/drug related? (here is a hint, it is 50%). Taking tests have apparently had no effect on drinking and driving licensed highway vehicles, do you really think taking a boat-safety test will be anymore effective for that, or anything else for that matter? Just more bologna from a misguided few."

6508016,kzoofisher,2020-12-14 19:22:00,5144,"Do you see any correlation between Ontario's boater safety requirements, strict alcohol prohibition and the low accident rate? Over 20% of Ontario households own boats and your death rate is less than 1:100,000. I can't find any break down of how many accidents and deaths involve visiting Americans which would be nice to know. I'd guess that when this years stats come out we'll have some idea."
6508030,prov1800,2020-12-14 20:26:00,5010,From what i usually hear on the news its US fisherman.Another dumb thing is its mandatory to have lifejackets on board but not mandatory to wear them.If there is a situation where you get tossed out of boat and the life jackets are stored somewhere in the boat youll never get them which is how the majority of boating deaths occurred.
6507656,v-bay gord,2020-12-14 08:24:00,3168,"As with many proposals, they are often dropped or modified once all input has been heard. This is only a proposal and I know many of us who rent boats have made our comments. For camps in NW Ontario who rent smaller boats to go fish with on semi remote lakes, having passed a course on the computer will not make things safer. Going over details of the boat you are renting and the lake you will be using it on can only be covered by someone down at the dock. All things considered either option doesn't guarantee you are not an idiot driving the boat. So we will wait and see how this shakes out. My prediction is the current boat rental checklist will remain for those renting boats at fishing camps. I have not seen any statistics to show this isn't working and things are unsafe."
6507658,prov1800,2020-12-14 08:29:00,5010,In Canada this has been a requirement for many years.I gave had one for 20 years already.Back then we had to take a course.Had a bunch of people come to my shop and had a instructor come and take us through it. Now can do it online.It is a pleasure boating license only.Meaning if i guide and get stopped i dont need to show my card but if i come home and take my wife out in evening i woukd have to produce it.Whole thing is a joke.Ive had lots of guests with me from states and a lot of them have a US card so uts been around a long time.But guess government us looking for revenue.In the end the course really didnt make it any safer.But have seen some pretty bad boaters over the years.I always thought it was funny that i needed to take the course but a non resident didnt and was given a boat to go fishing.

6507720,Bill Krejca,2020-12-14 10:05:00,6107,"Fair question. What data indicates the need for more regulation? I think it would be more accepted if some backup need data was shared. I wonder if it is likely that all the experienced folks who haven't had taken this new requirement test, but now would be required will, after proper indoctrination become suddenly more aware of whatever it is being taught, and become a safer operator. This, supposedly, is the goal. If enacted, the proving metrics connected with should be enlightening, eh? I have seen some figures from Iowa stating the high number of boating accidents where liquor was involved, certainly a bad situation, I think it was somewhere between 40-70%, don't remember exactly. The point being that taking a prior test would probably not effect much change in this situation. My guess is that imposing further requirements on U.S. tourists with boats would have zero effect on whatever problem is attempting to be solved. Again, understanding the problem to be solved would seemingly help in swallowing a new proposed rule for U.S. boat owners operating north of the border. Re: Comparing driving licenses to boating: Although some correlation can be made, Canada does not require a separate Canadian driver's license for U.S. folks already having a U.S license. Yet.

I have been going to Canada for over 30 years and haven't heard of a boating accident or issue (other than dinging the lower unit on a rock) any time I have been in camp. If people are falling out of boats, hitting people in the water or crashing into other boats, then by all means, it may be necessary, but it sounds like another way to get money out of your visitors. I guess, we use your resource, we should pay for it, but on the other hand we are pretty good for the economy also."

6507532,@Lunker,2020-12-13 20:51:00,835,"Cut and pasted from Facebook as posted by Stork Lake Lodge.“Re: Boaters Safety ChecklistPlease forward this to everyone in your group who plans to operate one of our boats.I hate to be the bearer of more bad news but Stork Lake Lodge is being proactive in addressing this issue.Transportation Canada has proposed changes to repeal the Rental Boat Safety Checklist as a form of proof of competency. This is that simple 15 statement form that camps have been using for years and if the new proposal is passed, will not be valid.Should it pass, this will force every client to obtain a PCOC (Pleasure Craft Operator Card). Non-residents will also have to obtain their PCOC or will have to show proof of a similar formation received in their country. As if Covid isn't enough....this will have a severe impact on many outfitters where clients are allowed to use a boat by themselves, for fishing, hunting or transportation means.I would like for all our guests that are renting our boats to be prepared. You could also get a Canadian Boaters Safety card but if they change the law they will also change the lifetime card to a 5 year renewal card. Meaning you would have to spend $45 every 5 years to renew. If they pass this proposal, you will not be able to operate our boats without a Boating License Card. We want our guests to be ready.The Boating License Card from the US is still a lifetime card for about $30 (rate depending on State). This card would be good to operate any rented boat in Canada and NOW would be a good time to get it. You will be asked to show your card before given the keys to the boat.It may not be a bad idea to take the course even if you bring your own boat. I wouldn't put it past Transportation Canada to require a Boating License Card to even operate your private boat in Canadian waters in the future.Here is a link to the https://www.boaterexam.com . Pick your State, take the online course, print your card and bring it with you. Most States are $29.95 for a Lifetime Card. Now would be the time to do this. Don't wait for the summer rush.Please forward this to everyone in your group who plans to operate one of our boats. We will be forced by Transport Canada to deny boat rental without a card.Please let us know as the boat operators in your group get their card. There would be nothing worse than to show up at camp and not have one.”"

Other than the lack of respect by some ""fisherman"" (I use that term loosely) for camp boats.Do or will Canadians be required to have the same ""certification""? Sounds like more bureaucracy BS, much like the ""Outdoor Card"".Again, will it make anyone safer? Does it really serve a purpose other than a revenue stream?Sorry for the (most likely) knee jerk reaction on my part.Pooch"
6507560,kettyspanky,2020-12-14 04:25:00,271,Thanks for the heads up. I understand the safety part but what's next. I guess more hoops to jump through if we get a chance to cross again. I better look into this.
6507566,Skywagon,2020-12-14 04:48:00,1106,"Pooch, Canadians are already required to have a card, tourists have been getting a pass on this up until now. Yes, in my opinion it is just another (subtle) money grab, the test is a joke, you can take it online, so basically open book. The climate in Canada is ripe for this sort of thing right now, one can never have too many regulations."
6507576,Huntindave,2020-12-14 05:52:00,2194,"Does having a drivers license to operate a motor vehicle on the road make sense to you? Does knowing and understanding the rules of the road makes sense to you? There was a time before the roads got crowded, one did not need a license. Just like roads, waterways have rules and regulations. It only makes sense that everyone has a piece of paper to show they went thru a course that at the very least presented them with that information. Will a piece of paper stop all boating accidents? About as well as a piece of paper stops all car accidents. Personally, I am surprised something like this has not been implemented before now. Probably needs done all across the US as well.What is the Pleasure Craft Operator Card (PCOC)? The PCOC is proof of competency that shows boaters understand how to operate a boat safely. This is achieved through taking the boater safety course online or in person and passing the final exam. Who Needs Proof of Competency in Canada?All Canadian residents operating a power-driven boat on Canadian waters (except for Nunavut and the Northwest Territories) need to carry proof of competency. Non-residents must also show proof of competency if they operate a craft that is registered in Canada or operate a motorized craft on Canadian waters for more than 44 consecutive days. Is the Pleasure Craft Operator Card the Same as a Boating Licence? The PCOC does not expire and therefore is not called a licence. Only a PCOC is required to legally operate a motor-powered boat on Canadian waters."
6507592,Shellback,2020-12-14 06:28:00,8083,Does any state or province require a hands on boat operating test? Pretty sure they are all just written or online courses. I'm most anyone could pass one of those if given enough time.
6507620,RichA$1970,2020-12-14 07:26:00,1159,"Just another nail in the coffin to turn off tourists in order to grab $$$. I could see if they set it for any boats exceeding a hp threshold of >20hp, but this is all about $$$ imo."
6507642,Huntindave,2020-12-14 07:53:00,2194,"Stay home then. Less traffic on the lakes means fewer accidents. As with anything, One can choose to be part of the solution or part of the problem."
6507646,Bill Krejca,2020-12-14 08:00:00,6107,"Right on, Pooch! more ridiculous ""protection"" regulations. As stated by C.S. Lewis some years ago, ""Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive."" Just more bureaucratic BS. Bill"
6507654,Huntindave,2020-12-14 08:16:00,2194,Please tell us why it is you feel boat operators do not need to know the boating regulations? Do you feel the requirement for a motor vehicle drivers license is ridiculous as well?
