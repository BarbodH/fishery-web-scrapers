My son has booked us a trip with 7 lakes wilderness outfitters for June 20th week, staying at there outpost camp. Any and all info would be helpful as I have been looking forward to one of these for 20 years. Hoping this is a good lake and a good place to stay. Info of any kind that would make our trip more successful would be appreciated. Good stuff, bad stuff, whatever. Fishing maps with hot spots marked would be appreciated. Do I need a fish finder, hot baits that work for pike, walleye, and perch spots would be appreciated. Thanks in advance."

I am sure you will have blast.I don't have any specific information you are looking for but there have been some great conversations the last couple months on here. If you scroll through the topics there is one on rod and real combos, meal planning along with countless others.A good starter read is https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...d.php?t=702812I would also go through and do a search for Mike Borger. He has went to countless resorts and provides excellent reports on each one. If nothing else watching all his videos about trips that he has taken and has taken his son to will occupy the good part of the week. His website is here, you can check if the place you are going is one he has been to. https://www.canadafishingguide.net/r.../fly-in-trips/"

Hopefully, we'll still be able to go."
