6508768,Bigtaproot,2020-12-16 19:20:00,900,I took your post to heart and I had a Canadian breakfast today while wearing a Canadian tuxedo. I really enjoyed
6508798,pjshorthorn,2020-12-16 21:26:00,5654,Ahhhh...another Kenora Dinner Jacket wearer !!!! Most excellent. PjShorthorn
6513902,nitroman,2021-01-04 17:23:00,368,Me too! as i am just a half hour away as well! I'll bring the Edgewood locker bacon and sausages!
6507936,johnboat,2020-12-14 15:32:00,2014,"Bill, That sounds mighty tasty to me. The next time you're in the mood to fix it up I'm only 30 minutes away and I'll bring some farm fresh eggs with me!"
6507958,Bill Krejca,2020-12-14 17:12:00,6107,"Thanks for the comments, guys, the spuds turned out good, wife even finished off the slim leftovers for supper. Normally, a trip north allows me to occasionally eat stuff which I don't have at home on a regular basis, I've already gained more than I should have in the last 8 or so months. Bill"
6507962,v-bay gord,2020-12-14 17:27:00,3168,"Since some people obviously have time on their hands, and the subject of cooking seems of interest perhaps I could suggest some research courtesy of Cowboy Kent Rollins........here's his surefire method of cooking crispy hashbrowns for your next Canadian outing....soon I hope. Yes, I've tried this and it works......https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttK2YP_ayYI"
6508010,Huntindave,2020-12-14 18:51:00,2194,"I shred my potatoes, then rinse the shredded potatoes with cold water. The water removes a lot of the starch which IMHO greatly improves the crispiness and flavor. After rinsing, the uncooked shredded potatoes are placed in a colander to fully drain the rinse water. Yes, cast iron is a must for fine cooking."
6508040,GBS,2020-12-14 21:42:00,2271,"Having spent too much of my life either being a breakfast cook in restaurants, a manager of same, owner of the restaurants, and then various ""big shot"" food service upper management positions....Ricky Spanish and Huntindave are on the right track for homemade, although most places just buy the same thing that Strictly Potatoes sells in the grocery store. Never frozen, but preprocessed at a factory. The other really big ""secret"" - more oil. Lots more oil. A tablespoon in a 14"" pan just won't do it. Start with three, at bare minimum. More is better. After adding to the pan, pat/pack them down with the spatula. When brown/crispy on one side, slide onto a big plate, add more oil to the pan, and then turn the plate upside down over the pan, to plop the whole thing in one piece to cook on the other side. As noted, restaurants have that big griddle, and big spatulas that make that operation so much easier. If the thought of potentially splashing hot oil around as you plop it back into the pan seems like a bad idea...then use a home spatula to put large sections of it back into the pan.Most add-ins (ham, peppers, etc.) can be mixed in at the start. Onions can be sprinkled on to the bottom, just before the turnover back into the pan. It does not need to cook near as long the second time - just enough to get the potatoes done. Thereby avoiding burning of the onions. Unless, of course, you want it crispy, but then you have a risk of overcooking and getting the un-crisp parts being mushy.Hashbrowns, as we know them, are pretty much a mid-country thing. Almost impossible to find in New England or the mid-Atlantic states. But then again, they eat weird things, like Scrapple, or grits...."
6508392,Guest,2020-12-15 19:14:00,0,Soak shredded potato's in water to remove starch. Put in towel and ring out water
6508550,Mojo-NC,2020-12-16 10:12:00,1929,"We discovered these gems quite by accident while shopping for groceries for our first fly-in trip. They make incredibly good hashbrown potatoes, you just have to add the extra ingredients. Add some hot water and let them sit for 10 minutes before dumping in a preheated frying pan. I like cooking them in butter. Thanks for the reminder, it's time for me to order more.https://www.amazon.com/Idaho-Spuds-P...8138036&sr=8-2"
6508554,rosh1,2020-12-16 10:16:00,275,All these ideas are making me hungry also makes me think of good Canadian poutine!
6508564,prov1800,2020-12-16 10:45:00,5010,I like the hash brown frozen patties.Can pop them in the toaster.
6508650,Ricky Spanish,2020-12-16 15:07:00,1298,Me too. Also love the triangle hash browns at TBL. Slight hint of onion in them. Always order extra.
6507662,Bill Krejca,2020-12-14 08:42:00,6107,"Having missed my Canadian trip this year, and longed for what I normally fix once a trip, I decided to fix hash browns at home. It consisted of hash browns, chopped ham, red pepper, and chopped onion, all smothered in cheddar cheese. Having come close or succeeded in the past of ruining a number of tries at this, an evolution eventually took place which I'll share. (Not much else going on right now, may as well have a recipe session) One of the potential problems( PP)with creating the hash browns is that restaurants have a huge flat plate to cook this on. And I do not. Not having same can tend to result in food being spread (read mess creation)over a MUCH larger area than just the cooking surface. Solution: Picked up a very large frying pan with high sides, which keeps almost all food inside. Also, at another garage sale, got a large fitting lid. Another PP: Potatoes turn to mush. Solution: Never use frozen hash browns, use Strictly Potatoes, which are sold refrigerated, but not frozen. Limit oil as practicable. Another PP: Burning. Solution: Continual observation over med high heat with turning regularly, however, too much turning can also increase mushing potential. May have to add a touch more oil as cooking progresses. Also, don't add onions until half way through, as they seem to burn more quickly than the rest of the ingredients which are all added together. When browned (or done)to liking, all having being cooked with lid off to avoid boiled effect, sprinkle shredded cheddar cheese over top(it cleverly hides any disasters), remove from heat, and cover with lid, a little salt and pepper can be added as desired. Seems simple enough, but after many tries with some results resembling a food fight in the kitchen, the above has worked out pretty well for me. Try it, you'll like it! Bill"
6507688,bbheli,2020-12-14 09:18:00,1387,"Sounds YUM, any leftovers ? I found that I can only get potatoes as crisp as I want them is by using cast Iron, I also have a piece of stainless steel that I can put on the grill to mimic a flat cooktop. I do Maxwell Street Style Polish and onions on it all the time."
6507702,vteye3,2020-12-14 09:29:00,496,"Homes fries (onions, potatoes, ham) at camp while at an outpost lodge is a food staple. Our group adjusts all other food allowances after daily ration of home fries. The only time its better than in Canada is when ice fishing at negative temps."
6507716,That Minnesota guy,2020-12-14 10:00:00,8293,You can go to a restaurant supply store and buy a add-a-grill. It's cast and covers 2 or 4 burners. Be aware that you will have hot spots over the burners and not so hot spot between the burners. Can also be used on your outdoor gas grill.
6507800,RichA$1970,2020-12-14 11:20:00,1159,"Well now I can’t wait to hit Waffle House in a couple of weeks. One key is when you have your potatoes shredded, take a plate and press them to a flat surface to get moisture out of them as they will fry faster and crispier."
6507848,Pooch,2020-12-14 12:24:00,4618,I'm having chest pains just reading this.... Pooch
6507888,Ricky Spanish,2020-12-14 13:25:00,1298,"Pro tip for home cooking...first microwave the hash browns and onions, drain off any water from the bowl, then roll it all in a tea towel or paper towels to squeeze out the rest. Removing as much moisture as possible is the key to crispy hash browns and less oil will be needed. If using tea towels do not put fabric softener in the wash."
6507900,prov1800,2020-12-14 13:50:00,5010,i see all you guys have taken up cooking since the border closed.lol. Bill no matter how messy or burned you make it id still eat it and never complain. Have made the hashbrowns many times at shorelunch on open fire and gas.never mattered how i scewed it up the guys have always said it was awesome.must be the fresh air on the shoreline.
6507916,Ricky Spanish,2020-12-14 14:21:00,1298,Everything tastes better when it's made at shore lunch. Best ever potatoes and onions was when James mixed in some ground moose meat. I almost skipped the fish.
6507924,prov1800,2020-12-14 14:52:00,5010,Have done that to.Moose is a real treat.Have brought out moose and deer saugage many times and skipped the fish.lol.Nobody ever comolained.
