6510982,prov1800,2020-12-25 10:47:00,5010,Have never fished Gull Rock.So cant comment on that.Have fished wabaskang a few times.Have done fine out there really not knowning where to go.Smallies where everywhere we tried.Main reason i went there was for pike.Someone mentioned pike wasnt very good.I think its awesome.Always have to filter through some smaller fish but we found some very nice pike.Well worth the effort.We also did quite well ice fishing for pike toward spring some great fish in there.
6511074,Habitual Eyer,2020-12-25 20:59:00,144,"I think an advantage that Gullrock has is the accessible waters that are also stacked with fish. Many fish holding places to duck out of the wind. Keg Lake (another body with a lifetime of structure), Chukuni River between Gullrock and Keg, and after mastering those one can easily venture up into Red Lake for another 25 miles of beautiful lake. Gullrock is much more than just Gullrock. Many don't know that when considering it for the first time. One can make a life out of exploring that system."
6510280,PostLake123,2020-12-22 14:32:00,6,"I'm sure everyone is hoping and anticipating the border will be open next summer for fisherman travel. So starting to plan a 2021 trip, and interested to try a new lake. When not to Canada, I have fished Minnesota waters of Rainy lake, and is the back-up plan. 2 years ago I fished Wabaskang by Perrualt falls, and we did Ok some days, and slow to fair on others. However, I only have experience fishing Wabaskang 1 year, so far from an expert on this lake, and could spend another season learning that lake. Before booking anything, I want to consider some other options, and am looking at Gullrock lake further north. Has anyone fished both of these lakes, and able to compare and contrast them, knowing I've only fished Wabaskang? Looking at the last full week of June (19th-26th). It looks like both Gullrock and Wabaskang both have 6 resorts on each, so boat/fishing pressure should be similar, although Gullrock looks to be a little larger surface area wise. I'd prefer a lake with fewer resorts, but are OK with this. I prefer the medium sized lakes, and traveling < 10 miles to fishing spots. Target walleye, and like casting for pike with opportunity at >35"" would be great. One thing we did not find at Wabaskang, northern were small on average. Smallmouth, perch, or lake trout in the area is a bonus, not a priority. This is a father/son trip, and my son will be 12 year old, but a good fisherman for his age. So I would like to lean towards the ""action"" lake, and easier to learn/find spots. I like the medium sized lakes, that have options vs. very small lakes/systems and not something ""too"" big to learn. Only drive-in, and I have my own 18 foot lund I bring. We are open to other suggestions, that might fit our needs vs. Gullrock or Wabaskang, but needs to be average on the budget for cabin rentals. I do realize I will need to find an opening, and not sure what 2021 looks like, as there is probably a lot of 2020 carryover to this summer. Feel free to PM if you prefer, and willing to share info."
6510328,Habitual Eyer,2020-12-22 18:22:00,144,Gullrock for sure. Have fished others mentioned....they're not even close. Always a great jig/minnow bite and seems like you start popping fish almost everywhere you stop. Size way better also.
6510342,Fishin Fun,2020-12-22 20:02:00,218,Great lake. I've fished it for many years. Not many hazards and a good walleye bite. I've stayed at Gullrock Lake Lodge and they are great people. My cousin stays at 5 Lakes Lodge and he has nothing but good to say about them too.
6510456,Walleye2242,2020-12-23 08:22:00,263,After 40 years of fishing ontario...gullrock is 1 of my favorites. It is much more crowded than it was years ago but the fishing is still worth the drive. We stay with Lee at wrights and it is great.
6510534,PostLake123,2020-12-23 10:57:00,6,"Appreciate the comments already, sounds Gullrock is a much better choice than returning to Wabaskang, and will start looking at the resorts mentioned. Any comments on the pike fishing at Gullrock? We also like doing a lot of casting for pike. How are the numbers, and potential for 35+"" ? Are there smallies in that lake, but smallies are not a priority. Again, open to other suggestions vs. Gullrock, but this lake sounds like a good option. Again, drive-in only, we bring our own boat, and average priced cabins....."
6510562,jackpotjohnny48,2020-12-23 12:45:00,153,"As far as northern pike go, Gullrock (and the entire Red Lake chain) has a reputation for producing above average numbers of 35+ inch pike. A lot of guys catch them accidentally while walleye jigging. Here's a link to the Wright's Camp Facebook page, where you can check out some of their pics. Quite a few pike over 35 inches in this batch of photos...https://www.facebook.com/gullrocklake"
6510778,johnboat,2020-12-24 10:08:00,2014,I've got a 20 year run on Gullrock for fishing and a handfull of hunts and have no plans on changing. Five Lakes Lodge for me.I'm of no help for the other place.
6510818,billy weaver,2020-12-24 12:52:00,470,"I have never fished Gullrock and it sounds like a great place to go. I have been fishing Wabaskang for 30 years and like the lake and the fishing to be had. I will say that staying at Peffleys on the north end of the lake there is less boat traffic. It is about 10 miles from another camp. Most of the good fishing is within 4 or 5 miles of the camp with a lot of them in sight of the camp. It is easy to navigate with few rock hazards. There is a small "" hike too"" catch release lake that you can fish after about a 3/4 mile hike through the bush on a established trail. For a young fisherman it can be a real adventure. A 100 fish day is expected at ""Lost Lake"" with over 18"" being the norm. Its real proof that ""Catch and Release"" works. The last 4 or 5 years the smallmouth fishing has really picked up with quite a few over 19 caught. We always go the 5th week of the season which is prime for smallmouth, weather and few bugs. I always fear if I brag to much on a lake to someone I'll put the hex on it. (hope I don't) Billy"
6510842,The tank,2020-12-24 14:20:00,340,We always did alright on Wabaskang. The gawley's are awsome people and resort. I've fished Pakwash the lake that connects to Gullrock but not gullrock. I can say lee Wright is a heck of a good guy owns a resort on gull rock. Can't help much with fishing. Heard it was a good pike lake from friends that fish there every year.
6510944,Habitual Eyer,2020-12-25 06:51:00,144,Wrights would be my first choice also. Lee runs a great camp. Location cant be beat.
