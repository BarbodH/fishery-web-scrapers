6506744,CiscoKid,2020-12-11 14:03:00,28,"My dad and I prefer taking our Canada trip in June in part because it suits our skill level (low) better than summer patterns. We prefer to fish shallow and do a fair amount of trolling weed lines and points as well as casting to shorelines. If we find fish trolling we will often times jig that area, but again we've had more success shallow than deep. I hate to be a pessimist, but I think our June trip in 2021 might get pushed to August due to COVID. My question: Any suggestions on techniques to research for deeper or suspended fish (walleye, northern, smallmouth). Anyone else that has shifted from trips from June to later summer have any pointers on what worked for you? We fish the Seine River Chain near Antikon. Information I have gathered is that Summer patterns have both smallmouth and walleye in 25-30 feet. Appreciate any pointers or suggested reading/videos. Thanks!"
6506794,7 Mag,2020-12-11 14:53:00,1887,Water clarity will dictate how you fish. If it's clear they will be deeper during day light hours so the bite will be in low light or dark conditions. If it's stained water you should be able to locate fish in shallower water than 30'. I don't fish deep water as the mortality rate isn't good when you fish deep water.. Fall fishing is more about technique such as a jig and minnow and patience. The fish can be scattered so you may have to move around more and rely on your electronics.
6506814,bobo4030,2020-12-11 15:59:00,235,"CK, Our Canada trips have been late July/early August. I wouldn't categorize my walleye fishing skills even at the average level. The water we fish is stained. We backtroll using minnows, night crawlers, leaches, or plastic. When a hot spot reveals itself, we will try jigging. We used to pack frozen hotdogs to be eaten as punishment if we don't catch dinner. A few years ago we stopped bringing them because we never needed them. Call it the magic of Canada or something else, but we've never been disappointed with the number of walleyes we've caught during that time period. In my experience, July/August fishing is very productive. However, since it is fishing,(YMMV) your mileage may vary. GOOD LUCK Be safe, Rick"
6506858,Pooch,2020-12-11 18:20:00,4618,"Fishing several Canadian lake from June to August the same years I've learned this. June finds us in shallower water, sometimes in four to eight foot trolling or casting shore lines. Near old weed beds, shallow flats of rock or sand. Back bays of decent size with deep water near are worth a serious look. I've gotten into two foot of water by accident and still caught fish. If you suspect that is the case, get back into deeper water and throw cranks into the shallows. End of June and into early July starts transitions to mid lake. Fish get scattered and can be found about anywhere depending on the season and lake. July to September finds us fishing all the classic summer spots. Drop offs between deep and shallow, rock points, sunken islands, weeds, anything that might collect bait fish. Skull size rocky shore lines and humps are minnow then fish magnets. Very general assumptions above, but usually a good place to start. Fishing the same lake in June then returning late July to late August is like fishing two totally different lakes. DO NOT fish memories. That super hot spot in June will usually be devoid of fish later in the summer. Pooch"
6506860,Pooch,2020-12-11 18:23:00,4618,"Bobo is one of my fishing partners and in the early years the goal of the trip was to not have to eat the hotdogs. Though a few times we did. ""Thank you Lord for teaching me humility"" Comes to mind... Pooch"
6506866,CiscoKid,2020-12-11 19:05:00,28,"Thanks for the comments guys, I'm trying to look at it as a fun way to do some new things, and probably need to keep in mind that I shouldn't fall in love with spots that have produced in June. I'm a little intimidated as finding under water structure that I can't see seems to pose a problem for me. Thanks again, hope everyone can get back on the water next season!"
6506876,kzoofisher,2020-12-11 20:30:00,5144,"Anywhere there is current is good even in August, the more current the better. Finding humps without a depth map can be a chore but if you have side scan it can be pretty easy. I wouldn't give up on all the areas that hold fish in June either. Any points or humps that hold fish may still have them on the deeper edges or have deeper humps near them. I've had good luck in late August with long points that step down to 20'+ and actually catch most of my fish in the 14'-22' range. They're not the biggest fish in the system but they're plentiful. That is in stained water with visibility down to about 5'. Great thing about points is you don't need a map to find them and it only takes a couple of minutes to motor around and see if it drops off in 20 yards or 200.This link has very good satellite images. You can often see points that run out 100 yards or more and those usually taper into the main basin more than dropping off a cliff. Sometimes you can also see the very tops of humps. By writing down the coordinates you can set a waypoint and get close enough to cut searching time way down. For instance, I just looked at Mosher Lake on the Seine and there's what appears to be an underwater point with several rock piles that just break the surface. Probably a lot going on between and around those piles. I'd also recommend keeping a close eye on your sonar if you're trolling and marking any humps you pass over or nearby. That's where the SI can really come in handy, searching 100' or more to either side for big features you can drive over and get a detailed look at later.Can you tell I like looking at maps in winter and planning future trips? https://www.lioapplications.lrc.gov....e&locale=en-CA"
6506888,CiscoKid,2020-12-11 21:12:00,28,"Awesome info, thank you. Like you I too like to look at maps, actually draw my own with past hotspots for fun!"
6506900,The tank,2020-12-11 22:04:00,340,In river systems I find myself fishing alot the same spots in August that I did in late may early June. I troll spinners in the hot months where I jig mostly in the cooler months. Thats for walleyes. More minnows in the spring and more crawlers in the warmer months.
6506962,jackpotjohnny48,2020-12-12 07:27:00,153,"The last couple of years, our Canada trips have been early to mid August on a deep, clear lake trout lake, where the primary forage is ciscoes (aka tullibees) One thing to keep in mind about ciscoes is that they prefer COLD water, which means that they won't be found in the shallows in August, because by mid to late summer, the warm waters of the shallows stresses the ciscoes quite a bit, so they head for deep water and congregate near the bottom. BUT... as evening approaches, the ciscoes move up (straight up) vertically in the water to feed on zooplankton / phytoplankton that are rising as the light level diminishes. Meanwhile, the walleyes are SUSPENDED out in deep water (usually in the upper 25 feet of the water column in water that is anywhere from 60 feet to 150 feet deep). As the ciscoes make their late evening vertical migration, the walleyes intercept the ciscoes, and the late evening / night bite can be fabulous out in open water far away from shore. (I'm attaching a 10-minute Lindner's Angling Edge video which demonstrates how this pattern works, and you can actually watch it like a video game on your depthfinder). We've done extremely well the last couple years trolling crankbaits from 8 pm until after midnight in the upper 20 feet of the water column in this very deep water. So that would be my highest confidence pattern if I were fishing a cisco based lake. If you're fishing a shallower, darker body of water, where something like perch might be the primary forage, then I don't think that the warmer waters of August will alter things quite as much. Perch tolerate warm water much better than ciscoes, so I believe that they can still be found in relatively shallower water in August. And if the forage is there, the walleyes can be there too. That's not to say that the fish in a perch-based system can't slide out deeper as summer progresses, but I think the migration to deeper water is much more pronounced on the cisco based, gin clear waters, since ciscoes are so much more intolerant of warm water. Anyway, that's been the biggest thing I think I've learned in the last couple years of August fishing in Canada. If you watch the attached video, it basically demonstrates exactly what we've been doing the last couple years on our August trips to cisco based lakes. (Note: If you're fishing a primarily perch based lake, I don't think the pattern is nearly as strong, because on a perch based lake, the walleyes have more forage available in shallow water in August) Hope that helps a bit ""Jackpot"" John Schroederhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55-AVdeGmuo"
6506974,CiscoKid,2020-12-12 07:44:00,28,"Can't thank you enough Jackpotjohnny48, this is great as there is one body of water in the chain we fish that would seem to fit this trolling pattern exactly."
6506976,CiscoKid,2020-12-12 07:49:00,28,"Thanks BornToFish - I 100% hear you on boat control. I only spend about 10 days a year fishing, with about 5 of those on a small 100 acre lake, so my boating skills are lacking. I get frustrated with boat control especially with any amount of wind. Knowing my lack of skill in the boat control department, going to take your advice on weed edges in the evening (i'm comfortable there). best I can do this winter is research boat control videos and give it a shot this upcoming summer. Appreciate everyone taking the time to weigh in."
6506978,BornToFish,2020-12-12 07:51:00,1224,"Greetings,JackPot: You were spot on with your observations about walleyes in trout waters, with ciscoes as the forage base. The neat thing about this pattern is that it focusses on the biggest walleyes in the system.I played around with that pattern several years ago. The pattern didn't initially do much for me as I eventually learned that I was trolling in the ""wrong"" part of the lake. A large section of the lake was essentially devoid of current. However, another section of the lake had slight current that flowed between an entering river and the outlet to another river. This section of the lake with very slight current was the place to look for the ciscoes, walleyes, northern pike and muskies. I figured this out one exceptionally calm night when the ciscoes were dimpling the surface as they fed. I started casting a silver floating Rapala and running it just under it just a few feet under the surface. The walleyes were there.The lakes that I am now fishing have perch and shiner minnows as the dominant forage base. I find that the ciscoe pattern is not as profitable for us.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6506988,BornToFish,2020-12-12 08:10:00,1224,"Greetings, Cisco: The best advice that I can offer about learning boat control for vertically jigging is to ride in someone's boat one evening and watch/learn what they do. The technique involves backing the boat (a tiller motor is easiest) into the waves, and then shifting the gear selector from reverse to neutral to reverse to neutral. The rhythm of switching gears is dictated by the height of the waves. I watch the angle of my line relative to the water's surface. I want the line to be perpendicular to the water. I know that I have to do something with the gear selector when the line is not perpendicular to the water. It's far better to make MANY SMALL adjustments compared to few large adjustments. I find that it's easiest to control my boat when vertical jigging when there is some wind. I don't want it to be calm as I then find myself doing ""loop d' loops"". It gets to be too much trouble when the waves are mid-sized whitecaps. I encourage you to keep a few marker buoys in the boat when you start learning how to control your boat. Put a marker buoy just upwind of where you think the fish are. Then, keep your eye on the buoy and maintain a constant distance from the buoy by using the gear selector. Many folks find it easier to relate to the marker buoy than watching the angle of their fishing line to the water. With sufficient practice, you will be able to work a rectangle on a rock hump. For example, I will work a ways down one depth contour line and then change to a different depth contour and work my way back to my starting point. Good electronics are very helpful when running a rectangle. I keep one eye on my electronics and the other eye on the angle of my fishing line to the water. The type of boat control that I am describing is like riding a bicycle. You will never forget once learned."
6507110,CiscoKid,2020-12-12 12:23:00,28,"BornToFish: well i learned something new today about boat control, thanks. Had no idea the technique you wrote about... can't wait to give it a try. I find myself trying to position my drift only becaus ei have not really known how to hold my spot with boat control like you spoke of."
6507116,BornToFish,2020-12-12 13:04:00,1224,"Greetings, Cisco: The technique that I described for boat control when vertically jigging is difficult to learn, but once learned will never be forgotten. I don't know how many thousands of walleyes vertical jigging rock humps during August has put in the boat for my wife and me. Even if I knew, I doubt that anyone would believe me. I frequently have friends fish with me after suppers, as my wife often wants to stay in for the evening. These friends sometimes offer to operate the boat to give me a break. I almost always decline their offer with a polite smile on my face. There is a thread under this Canada Forum about advice that guys would give to first-timers fishing in NW Ontario. There is some great advice on this thread! ' Good fishing and tight lines!!"

6512164,BornToFish,2020-12-29 09:40:00,1224,"Greetings,I met an older gentleman at the dock many years ago, when I was learning to fish at a lodge in NW Ontario. He shared a pearl of wisdom with me that I remember to this day. I don't remember his exact words, but it was something similar to the following: ""Rig'em to find 'em, jig'em to catch 'em"". I use Lindy rigs and bottom bouncers to locate fish. Once located, I switch to jigs to catch fish. I am as likely to be moving away from fish as I am towards them when pulling rigs. I have heard many anglers at the dock say they kept catching fish in this ""one spot"" every time they drifted or trolled rigs along a shoreline. I wonder why they didn't anchor near that spot and probe it with casts or vertical jig it.I find bottom bouncers to be a better choice when the bottom is ""snaggy"", rather than Lindy rigs. The key is to ""bounce"" the bottom bouncer and not ""drag"" it.Smallies will be near the walleyes in mid-August. The smallies are generally a bit higher up in the water column than the walleyes. That is, the smallies will be near the top of the structure, while the walleyes will be deeper along the edges of the structure.You seem to have developed a ""friendship"" with the lodge owner. Ask him/her if he/she knows how to control a boat while vertical jigging. If so, ask him/her to take you out for a lesson. If not, ask if a guide is available to show you how. Maybe a fellow angler at the dock could show you how to operate the boat while vertical jigging.Operating the boat while vertical jigging isn't that difficult to do once you understand how to do it. I mentioned above that it's best to make many small adjustments with the motor rather than a few larger adjustments - keep your line vertical!I find that bugs are generally not an issue in August. I also find that boat traffic on the lakes declines in August as many families have completed their vacations and are preparing for return to schoolGood fishing and tight lines!!"
6512100,CiscoKid,2020-12-29 08:25:00,28,"I'm back after some research and have officially moved my trip date to mid-August. For the mid summer bite do any of you guys Lindy rig or bottom bounce? I am familiar with the techniques, but have never used them. If boat control is an issue for me and the lake is fairly snaggy, would you suggest that bottom bouncing is an easier technique to ""master"" over Lindy rigging? Both walleye and smallmouth are typically in 20-25' of water according to camp owner in mid August. Thanks!"
6506952,BornToFish,2020-12-12 07:05:00,1224,"Greetings,There has been a lot of good advice given by everyone on this topic. I especially liked Pooch's comment to not fish memories. June's hot spots may very well be devoid of fish in August.My wife and I have very likely caught more walleyes during August than all the other months of the season combined. We primarily rely upon two patterns. One is to fish weed edges in the evening, often just before dark. Weed edges in close proximity to relatively deep water are often best for us. Weed edges receiving wind can be magical.The other pattern is off-shore rock humps - those not associated with shoreline. Again, we favor rock humps in close proximity to relatively deep water (>35 fow). We fish the depth of water on the sides of the rock hump that is holding the fish. For example, we might fish in 23 fow for a rock hump that tops out in 12 fow, but has 40 fow of water within a cast or two of the top. The preferred depth of water that holds fish will change throughout the day. The fish generally move shallower on the rock hump in the evening, and deeper in the morning.Small mouth bass are often found just above the walleyes on these rock humps. The biggest northern pike in the system are often just above the thermocline, within a cast or two of the walleyes.August is often a month of considerable transition. I might fish 15 fow of water in early August, and then 35 fow of water at the end of the month. Many lakes encounter peak water temperature in the middle of August. Lush weed beds in early August may be all but gone by the end of the month or early September.The single biggest factor that has distinguished anglers that catch fish in August from those that are simply taking boat rides is BOAT CONTROL! Learn how to control your boat to vertically jig. This is a lot easier said than done. It's often best learned from riding in someone else's boat that knows how to control his/her boat when vertically jigging. Many anglers try to control their boat to vertically jig and get frustrated. These anglers give up and default to some other presentation. Learning boat control for vertical jigging is very much like learning to ride a bicycle: once you learn, you will probably never forget.Walleyes often congregate in schools when on off-shore rock humps. They might move up or down the sides of the rock humps, but they typically don't go far during the course of the day. The part of the rock hump holding fishing is often on the upwind side, or associated with a structural element of the rock hump (e.g. a saddle between two humps, an inside turn, an outside turn, a patch of moss or other transition within bottom content). I'm thinking ""game on"" when I pull up to a rock hump during August and catch my first walleye, as I then know where they all are. I just keep the boat positioned over the school of fish and have at them until we run out of bait or get tired.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
