Very few cases in N/W Ontario which is good, because we hardly have the facilities to even handle the odd case that requires hospital care in our 4 small hospitals that service the entire area from Thunder Bay to beyond the Manitoba border. The solution will be proof of vaccination when coming north."
6511908,RichA$1970,2020-12-28 17:57:00,1159,"[QUOTE=Skywagon;6511898]No, didn’t mean the problem is on your end, just wondering what it will take to get entry and guess it will be proof of vaccination. We used to have shot cards while contracting in Asia & Australia that you could write whatever vaccine you needed and had to tape them in our passports as it was another item to keep track of, however they never looked at them in immigration."
6511930,prov1800,2020-12-28 18:40:00,5010,Going to take more than 4 months to give out the vaccines.Maybe some time in fall for us in Canada.Cant imagine how long it will take with your population.
6509960,prov1800,2020-12-21 12:01:00,5010,"Got over to the ice shacks yesterday afternoon.Got there at 3:30 and Wayne and Zack had everything ready to go.2 shacks going with heat.Started off in one and then i ended up going into minnow shack. Both shacks were on fire.Everyone was hauling up fish.Lots of triples with myself my wife and Zack.Had a couple of young kids fish also and they had a great time and never lost interested with the tge action tgey were having.Sonar showed steady fish on bottom.Around 5 things just started to slow down and we figured time to pack up.Today made a trip to Dryden to pick up some groceries and went and checked out Clarks Bait and Tackle store.Got everything in there a guy needs for ice fishing. Ice shelters,augers rods and reels.Actually bought a stiff lake trout rod for my son for xmas."
6511492,prov1800,2020-12-27 14:58:00,5010,Got my wife out to ice shack again.Beautifull day.I turned heat on and went back outside to get some stuff from my truck and by the time i came back she had her limit in the pail already.Crazy bite.Must be all the extra fish in the lake that wernt taken out this summer.We got there at 2 and fished till 4 none stop.Got a couple of nice walleye dinners.
6511602,Eckohlt,2020-12-27 18:08:00,3685,"I saw half that many fish in 3 days ice fishing there,are you sure your at the same lake I was at?lol.I had non stop NO action there"
6511604,prov1800,2020-12-27 18:25:00,5010,"Absolutly same place Rod.Just shacks are in different spots.I know the week you were here fishing died.I was there to.But got good as soon as you left and border closed.lol.Must be all the extra 30,000 walleyes that wernt caught this year."
6511628,Eckohlt,2020-12-27 18:58:00,3685,"John your going to get a work out,you have about 29,990 fish left to catch this winter,and if you have fish n potatoes everyday your going to be big as the ice shack"
6511734,prov1800,2020-12-28 08:39:00,5010,It will be a tough job but someone has to do it.Be nice if they would open border then you could come up and help me out.Trout opens on Jan 1. Weather forecast is looking pretty good and might not need a pop up.-30 c with wind here this morning not going anywhere today.
6511788,Eckohlt,2020-12-28 10:11:00,3685,"Wish I could help you out,but I don't have a key to unlock the gate to get there"
6511808,prov1800,2020-12-28 11:01:00,5010,Very unfortunate situation.They are going to have to figure something out quickly like before end of April.4 short months.Doesnt sound like a lot of time.
6511830,RichA$1970,2020-12-28 11:49:00,1159,It would be helpful to show the amount of citizens vaccinated & vaccines delivered by each province / state to show progress that might help open the borders. I suspect having proof of vaccination will be required for entry & gamble more on 3Q2021 entry which cuts half the season.

6509150,RichA$1970,2020-12-18 08:13:00,1159,"Brian,Very well stated and fair imo. Under these conditions businesses are trying to survive today to be able to work in the future- all over and not just fishing camps. The outfitter reminds me of venture capitalists with capital building their portfolio with the potential for more acquisitions based on competitors going under. If they have refunded deposits as asked or carried them over to the next year without any other conditions then that is fair imo and someone you can do business with. However if not, for your Outfitter refund thread you have documented that I think many of us appreciate, you may need to add another category for refund status.....”Outfitter used your deposit to start another business.”"
6509212,prov1800,2020-12-18 11:49:00,5010,So got up early and headed over to Edward Lake and try early bite.Great choice.Non stop action from 7:30-9:30.bottom had steady fish moving through constantly.Got to drive truck right to shack door.All 3 shacks are also on the ice.
6509216,prov1800,2020-12-18 12:01:00,5010,Good question not sure.There was no sign up when i was there. If you come into dryden past paper mill you head toward safeway and keep going straight over the over pass.Its on the right hand side headed to wallmart.
6509248,BrianinVA,2020-12-18 14:16:00,160,"If anyone is interested in supporting a small business Tackle & Bait shop during their next trip through Dryden, QSL Tackle (and laundry!) at 102 Queen Street in Dryden has a good selection of tackle and live bait. It is conveniently located between the Beer Store and the LCBO with plenty of parking."
6509250,Pickypickerel,2020-12-18 14:24:00,151,Me personally i always like to try new places.....but thats just me !
6509256,7 Mag,2020-12-18 14:29:00,1887,"Hey John looks like you found a good spot to fish! Hope the ice is nice and thick, hate to see you lose that nice truck!"
6509264,prov1800,2020-12-18 15:02:00,5010,"Shack is in the same spot as tge last few years.Water is lower this year.normally in 20 ft only 17-18 this year but seems they are there.Wayne and his nephew Chris have been out there with there trucks pretty steady so feel its just fine to drive out there.peobably a good foot thick now.Had 8"" last Fri."
6509268,prov1800,2020-12-18 15:08:00,5010,Iam with you there.
6509308,Skywagon,2020-12-18 17:12:00,1106,"QSL has been for sale for a while, the owners wants to retire. I predict that the new bait shop will do well if they put the right person behind the counter. My friend is stopping there in the morning to pick up our minnows for the day, buy 2 dozen minnows the 3rd dozen is free."
6509312,prov1800,2020-12-18 17:24:00,5010,Good luck on your fishing trip tomorrow.
6508942,BrianinVA,2020-12-17 11:18:00,160,I just want to make sure I understand things correctly. Clark’s stated they would be out of business next year if they had to roll over 2020 deposits but now they have enough capital to open a new bait and tackle shop?
6508956,pjshorthorn,2020-12-17 11:48:00,5654,"Maybe they sold off some outpost locations. Maybe they had a family member pass away that left a large inheritance. Maybe they had a lucky streak at the casinos. Maybe they bought a business for pennies on the dollar that was forced to close. There are a myriad of reasons that may have allowed them to make this smart business decision as there aren’t many bait dealers from Vermilion Bay to Sioux Lookout . Instead of beating a , you may just want to pick up the phone and ask them yourself.....I could care less what they do in their business nor is it any of my flipping business. I do find it interesting though how others feel it is their duty to question their business decisions.PjShorthorn"
6509034,prov1800,2020-12-17 18:03:00,5010,Clarks are always busy people.Wayne and Karla arent the type of people who sit back and hope everything cures itself.They have planes and use a couple to transport goods up north to the reserves and keep some of their employees going to keep their families going. The dryden area needed a good bait and tackle store and Wayne and Karla know that business better than most. They have the bait so might as well sell it. Plus they will employ some more of there staff.This border thing is long from over and if it keeps on going through next summer you better get into something else to make a living.Basically thats what they have done.
6509046,Da' Walleye Assassun,2020-12-17 19:08:00,358,Honesty and integrity are important in Clark's new venture. It's too easy to pull a bait and switch. Mebbe free water can be provided with minner purchases.
6509052,prov1800,2020-12-17 19:19:00,5010,Got all the water you need when you drill your hole through the ice. Nice and cold to.
6509106,Eckohlt,2020-12-18 05:00:00,3685,"John make sure you have that United State life jacket on when your ice fishing that big minnow hole,we need you here on WC,not on the bottom of lake"
6509110,prov1800,2020-12-18 05:14:00,5010,Ill be carefull for sure. That is a big hole.lol.
6509112,prov1800,2020-12-18 05:30:00,5010,Ill be carefull for sure. That is a big hole.lol.

6509126,BrianinVA,2020-12-18 06:47:00,160,"John, I appreciate your response. No one is calling into question the Clark's work ethics. It's the optics of opening up a new business venture that appears to be funded by 2020 deposit money that many past and potential customers will find problematic. As you hinted at, there is a real chance border closures and travel restrictions could drag out into the 2021 season. That's why it's especially important for the industry to get their messaging right. It comes off as extremely disingenuous when Clark's is one of the most vocal voices calling for government assistance while simultaneously spending capital to expand operations. Their actions and inconsistent messaging will ultimately hurt the industry if those in charge of the purse strings are paying attention. I'm optimistic that 2021 will bring renewed hope for all those in the industry. In the event that this drags out into the summer, for the sake of the entire industry, I hope other resort operators step up and become more vocal because Clark's is simply the wrong messenger. BrianinVA"
6508504,prov1800,2020-12-16 07:22:00,5010,Did you have a good trip
6508506,prov1800,2020-12-16 07:30:00,5010,No nothing will happen at the old spot in Eagle River.Store in Dryden is nice.It will be a busy place. Lots of parking space like Eagle River.If border opens it will get double busy plus they will still sell minnows at their place up on Cedar Lake..
6508646,Bill Krejca,2020-12-16 14:50:00,6107,Lookin' good!!! Bill

Basically a white out on lake today with strong winds.First time out on ice is awesome.Nothing huge but plenty of eaters."
