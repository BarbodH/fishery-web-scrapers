6512192,nitroman,2020-12-29 10:32:00,368,My beginning was a continuation of others trip. I have 2 friends from high school that I reconnected with after my military service. We have a place on the Mississippi river in NE Iowa that they would come stay at on Memorial day weekend every year. in 2001 they were up here and we would always go to Cabela's in PDC so they could stock up for the trip. After a a couple years of listening to their fishing stories and seeing their excitement about the upcoming trip I asked if they had room for me next year. 2002 was my first trip. I was not prepared and didn't have enough gear or tackle. I was cold and wet a lot but caught my first walleye and northern. I was hooked! Fast forward to current and I am now great friends with the camp owners and make 2-3 trips a year if I can. We work the sports show for them in Cedar Falls each year now as well. Our group Has changed from that first trip i went on in 2002. We had 14 guys that year. We went down to just 4 of us for a couple years until kids got old enough to go and now we are around 10-16 people each year. And my wife now goes and I love it. We used to drive thru the night stopping at the Black Bear casino near Cloquet MN and then for breakfast at the T Patten Cafe in Orr MN. After gassing up and crossing the border it was on to the village corner in Vermillion bay! now we leave Friday morning and drive straight to the border with a stop at Gordy's for lunch in Cloquet. then overnight in Nestor falls before finishing the drive Saturday morning to camp at Cedar Lake at Cedar Point resort. Many years of memories and pictures and I hope many more to come!! Wow thanks for brining these memories back and tight lines to ya!
6512338,kettyspanky,2020-12-30 04:02:00,271,Our trips to Canada started when our ice fishing group wanted to try something different since we always ice fished in minnesota. Someone said let's go to Canada. 1995 was our first ice fishing trip there. I caught a 29 inch walleye and I was hooked. We never went back until I bought my boat in 2014 and a friend asked if my fishing partner and I would be interested in joining his group in July. It's been a annual trip until this year with covid. Hopefully 2021 will give us a chance to get back up there. Reservations are already made so I guess time will tell. Good luck out there.

Glad everyone is stirring up fond memories I have found writing the blog, searching old photos and chatting with my brother and other fine folks I have fished with over the years to be therapeutic. Reminded me of how grateful I am to be able to spend a fair amount of time outdoors searching for fish, sitting around campfires or just going for a hike Cheers Andrew"
