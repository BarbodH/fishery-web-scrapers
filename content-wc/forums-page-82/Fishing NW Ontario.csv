6466410,lenray,2020-07-21 19:51:00,467,GO to the village of Pickle Lake--drive up that gravel road until you take at least two stoners to da winder and eat too much dust.

Here is hoping we have the health to get there next year. Keep healthy, that's the key for us older guys. To your health, Paul"
6466488,HeHooksHimself,2020-07-22 06:48:00,725,"Ha Ha, got it!"
6466506,lenray,2020-07-22 07:20:00,467,Hi Paul--good to hear from you. You fellas from the Keystone are the best. I am looking at lakes in the UP of Michigan for gills. I don't think Ontario will open this year. They have locked out the Blue Jays from baseball in Toronto......I have been working very hard here in Michigan---it helps along with my Faith to keep moving ahead with out my Dear Wife. 10-29-2018--We just missed 51 years. The thing is I don't have the energy to work hard all day. Time has not been a healer for me. I knew her for over 65 years..She fished up there with me.....I just got my 10th. tractor this late spring---a Ford 5000 flat deck narrow front. You are your cousin take care...................
6466520,Bill Krejca,2020-07-22 08:09:00,6107,"Interesting approach to best enjoying the wilderness. Reminds me, kinda, of a story which I read in a boundary magazine some years ago. The story, written in a sort of a journal form, consisted of a one way trip into the wilds by a fellow who was wrestling with cancer. He portaged in to a number of waters and finally picked a spot where he wanted to remain. Very keen description of the appreciation the man had for the wilderness, and how he succumbed. Not a happy ending, necessarily, but maybe it depends on how you look at it, maybe it wasn't. Bill"
6468738,Guest,2020-07-28 12:27:00,0,"I think that sounds like an awesome ending to a life story! This topic is often discussed on our annual trips. I am still a few decades off from my end (hopefully, but who knows) and have often thought if my last breath was in the Far North enjoying a view, things could be far worse p Sounds like this gentleman had similar thoughts. After the trials he had experienced I am sure his last scenes of life were a joy for him. Tight lines and fair winds to him!"
6505344,kim n indiana,2020-12-07 17:39:00,62,i came close one year. out of breath all time. just took it easy. get home. finally go to doc month later.

6510164,lenray,2020-12-22 07:26:00,467,2021---not looking good right now....A lot needs to happen before the border lets us in. Maybe proof of a shot for the virus for starters..................

6464136,Eckohlt,2020-07-16 04:52:00,3685,"Lenray I have not been to frog,I have ice fished newangank n forester lake with Pete johnson there in the area"
6464166,lenray,2020-07-16 06:18:00,467,"What I know of Frog Rapids is below Ketch. on Horeshoe Lake. I don't personally know Pete Johnson, but know guys in Pickle Lake that know him. Was told last August that he was having serious health issues..................."
6464180,RichA$1970,2020-07-16 06:39:00,1159,I saw Pete last year at the show and was wondering the same thing. He was always nice to talk to n wish he had a journal of his adventures to read. Pickle Lake is just a journey to get to.
6464184,phishfearme,2020-07-16 06:43:00,1242,"always welcome posts from lenray = the ultimate backcountry fisherman. I've fished essentially all the lakes that surround (upstream or downstream) where Len fishes - the ones i go to have outposts cabins on them and for Len, even the most rustic of these would be too luxurious and the lakes would be too crowded - he fishes where ""fishing is what it used to be"" as Faron Buckler (Excellent Adventures) calls it, describing his boat stash only lakes. we did a trip to ketch lake a few years ago - very disappointing - found nets at most river narrows - and this is really not much of a lake - just a point where three major rivers come together. we did portage down past frog - same thing - flow is huge and few fish. i talked with Pete Johnson a few weeks ago as our trip with him to north caribou had to be postponed to next year - he seems well although recently he has had some health challenges. he will probably end up being able to attend most of our funerals. phish"
6464204,HeHooksHimself,2020-07-16 07:55:00,725,"Lenray, could you please detail the highways, landmarks and names of the waterways? I am sure we would all like to share your solitude in the future. Maps would also be helpful."
6464290,IaDave14,2020-07-16 10:32:00,99,I believe the river he is talking about is about 70 miles north of Pickle Lake it is a gravel road . My first trip to Canada was in 1997 a fly-in out of Pickle Lake and after a couple of years we decided to haul a boat up and stay at the outfitters cabin. We fished Mud Lake north of Pickle Lake about 30 miles. My fishing partners brother-in-law took a camper up in April and stayed all summer at the campground on Mud Lake. His name was Marv and the locals called him the Rev Lenray may have run into him along the way.
6464326,Eckohlt,2020-07-16 11:16:00,3685,"Had a great time with Pete on our ice fishing trip to his fly in camps,he is a very nice guy"
6464354,lenray,2020-07-16 12:53:00,467,Farther dave 130 miles--I know of Mud can't spell the name Badasdawa--is that also Mud LAKE??????????????
6464384,IaDave14,2020-07-16 15:44:00,99,"That's it I think Mud is what the locals call it. We fished all day and spent alot of time exploring. Went up river for awhile till we came to a twin falls. I think Bow Lake was above them. Another day we tried the lake between there and the river but way too windy to do much. I'm sure you know the bridge that goes over July falls we stopped and fished from shore there and caught many on the smaller side 16"" or so. We only spent 3 days up there cause my partner really hurt his knee bad. I think we only saw one vehicle on that road all 3 days. There were primitive campsites at Mud lake where Marv stayed. It was mostly locals from Pickle Lake and Marv. They got the camping permits in town I have no idea if it is still there as this was 20+ yrs ago."
6466390,lenray,2020-07-21 19:21:00,467,I always love and enjoy your writings--you are da Man...................
6464030,lenray,2020-07-15 17:40:00,467,"Just sharing what I like about fishing in NW Ontario. I am 75 and have been going to the same water since 2002. It is a lake that you can drive to. From Michigan it is a long drive. I go up a river about 3 hours and then into the lake another hour. I also portage off the main lake with a square back canoe and a 3 HP Johnson. I tent camp and in all those years have never seen another boat. So if the border opens this year--doubt it will, I will be gone with a day to pack. Just for me I would never use a Lodge and will never fish where I could see another fisherman. I release pike in the over 40 inch every year and the number of eyes--most wouldn't believe....never bring fish home never leave any trash. Solitude is the key for me.............."
6464038,Eckohlt,2020-07-15 17:59:00,3685,That's getting deep in the jungle lenray
6464042,lenray,2020-07-15 18:08:00,467,It is and at my age every trip is much appreciated.......................
6464050,Eckohlt,2020-07-15 18:19:00,3685,"Hope you have few more in you lenray,if you ever stuck in the jungle and need help getting out call my cell I'll come get you if I can find you"
6464052,Eckohlt,2020-07-15 18:24:00,3685,Do you fish kecheokagan lake?
6464054,v-bay gord,2020-07-15 18:28:00,3168,Lenray...if you ever need a cold beer or a bed to crash in let me know....
6464066,RichA$1970,2020-07-15 18:42:00,1159,Sounds awesome n hope you get to go this year. I am getting to that point also as I miss the days of camping n not seeing a soul for a week. My crew is older than me so they wonâ€™t camp anymore so a rough cabin is what we get on fly ins
6464068,lenray,2020-07-15 18:43:00,467,The rapids out of the Frog are to strong for me to get up in there--thought of coming down from Stirland. Have you been there ????
6464072,lenray,2020-07-15 18:48:00,467,That is very kind and generous of you many thanks.............................
6464134,tv4fish,2020-07-16 04:31:00,2694,"lenray: You are truly a brave and confident man. Now - that said - Have you ever had any ""close calls"" up there by yourself? That IS remote territory and like the say ""Stuff happens""............"
