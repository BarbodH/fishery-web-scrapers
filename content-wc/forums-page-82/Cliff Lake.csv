They didnt have to go to far.Spot they targeted had 8"" of ice.Trout lakes take a lot longer to freeze and have to still be carefull on them as they always have airholes.Weather has been very mild up here also.They had a fun day catching some nice lakers and just kept 2 for a great meal.Cliff lake was barely fished this summer so that cant hurt with the slow growing lake trout.Pressure is normally very low to begin with."
