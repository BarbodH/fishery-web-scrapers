6515044,prov1800,2021-01-08 07:40:00,5010,Good read.have read that before. John Butts is a good freind of mine. I have fished wabigoon and dinirwic lakes a couple if times but cedar lake is 15 mim from my house so end up going there.There are lots of fisherman coming to cedar from all over in the winter but last few years they have been slowing down which iam glad to see. I like my piece and quite on winter days out on the ice.

6514100,Yellowfin123,2021-01-05 10:34:00,2182,my grandfather built a house on lotw after ww2 on a place called hay island needle point and thats the hay island i guess would be the ne part of the lake like up towards longbow lake. i cant imagine what the fishin was like then! my dad didn't fish and my parents sold it in 1970 when i was 2 so i never saw it! i jump up and down screaming beating my head on the walls that they sold it lol! lotw after ww2 must of been really somethin! i would love to hear some stories sometime
6514176,Bill Krejca,2021-01-05 13:48:00,6107,"Yeah, I believe there is a Hay Island up that way, there is another Hay Island near Turtle Lake. There is a camp on it, Duck Bay, I believe. I used to pitch a tent on the north end of the island, the tornado some years back completely tore up our old camping spot on it. Bill"
6514192,Yellowfin123,2021-01-05 14:04:00,2182,its about 8 mile as the crow flies se of kenora
6514284,fsz,2021-01-05 17:33:00,144,Wasn't the border only closed for one season so far?
6514294,prov1800,2021-01-05 17:49:00,5010,Just one as far as i know of
6514550,runuts2,2021-01-06 14:31:00,25,I guess I was thinking more about two spawning cycles for most species. That is unless the border opens in 4 to 5 months.
6514730,Bill Krejca,2021-01-07 07:57:00,6107,"My belief regarding the expected positive crappie expectations was/is based upon the fact that crappies are particularly susceptible to being caught while in the shallows spawning, there being few restrictions on areas where fishing is not allowed during the spawn. With hardly anyone having fished those areas this past year, the spawners(generally larger fish) were able to not only follow through with the spawning process, but were able to remain, with a chance to grow a bit larger. This, to me, is a very positive in terms of better fishing. Situations for walleye are somewhat different, as the season is closed while the majority of them are spawning. Bill"
6514740,prov1800,2021-01-07 08:24:00,5010,"Your absolutly right Bill.There is no closed season on crappies as basically they are invasive species here. No one is quite surè how they got into our lakes.Lotw has always had them but only the last 10 years or so in our area.Iam surprised tgere is even a limit on them.But glad there is.Our northern limit is 15 and lakes in zone 5 are at 10.iam really looking forward to that first week of June or so depending on water temps.Last spring was to most relaxing time i ever had fishing for them with zero competition.Have a feeling my wife and i will get a secind crack at them with the same conditions.We caught many 12-14"" fish which is a amazing catch.I have found over the years to throw the big ones back as they are not as good eating as a 10-11"".Just my 2 cents. And leave them to spawn.I always encourage my guests to throw them back as well.With any species we have here i love to let big fish go.Gives me a good feeling and just keep a couple smaller better tasting fish for a meal."
6515004,tv4fish,2021-01-08 04:55:00,2694,"Here is some interesting info on your ""northern"" crappies:https://www.northernontario.travel/f...appie-goldmine"
6515042,Bill Krejca,2021-01-08 07:33:00,6107,"Some interesting info on northwoods crappie: I read recently, I believe it was in Fishing Facts mag, that studies have shown that some fish can be introduced to new waters by the eggs being eaten by duck types, the birds then poop out the eggs in another body of water, and some of the eggs remain in a condition for successful hatching to occur. This could explain some of the ""stocking"" in different waters, along with the previously accepted theory that eggs attached to birds feet carry the eggs to another body of water. Interestingly, I have never seen an explanation for the ""sudden discovery"" of large mouth in LOW during the early 1980's. My theory is extensive stocking was accomplished during a mammoth effort by supportive individuals at the time (non-DNR folks). Re: LOW crappies - Turns out they actually were introduced, legally, by the DNR during the 1920's, perhaps at the same time(1926 ish)as small mouth were introduced to LOW. My dad caught an 18 inch LOW crappie in the 1930's on a large Dardevle. He released it, as he had been told of the previous stocking, and wanted to help in the spread. Long winter still acoming...

6513756,runuts2,2021-01-04 08:19:00,25,"What will fishing be like in areas that normally receive a lot of American anglers? After 2 years of greatly reduced fishing pressure, should we expect noticeably better size, numbers and ease of catching?"
6513758,Eckohlt,2021-01-04 08:25:00,3685,"Probably find more people than fish in those areas,if they unlock the gate for us"
6513854,MrSimon,2021-01-04 13:45:00,922,"On drive-to lakes that normally get heavy pressure and harvesting, yes you'll probably notice an increase in size and numbers. On remote lakes that don't normally get much pressure anyway, I don't think you'll notice much of a difference."
6513898,prov1800,2021-01-04 17:14:00,5010,I fished from spring till freeze up.Spring fishing seemed like a normal spring to fish with my normal catches.The only difference was no boats. Not even locals.I fished Lac suel and few times and Eagle.I saw the most boats on these lakes but iam taking 5 boats no more.I fished mainly Cedar Lake as its so close and maybe saw 2-3 boats some days.As season went on and into fall i didnt notice different fishing.Caught about the same as i usually do.Ice fishing now and having good outings but again nust normal catch and size.If border opens fisherman will have good catches on there spots but nobody will get anymore fish than you would normally catch on any given year.Each lake will have a number of more fish in it for sure.Iam sure ther will be more larger fish that survived the summer instead of ending up in a fry pan.This goes the same for flyouts and portage lakes.Fish grow very slow here once fall comes tgere about done growing till spring.I had the oppurtunity for tge very first time to take my wife for the crappie spawn on Cedar.Zero boats on the lake.We fished all the spots i know off plus the spots that would of normally get pounded by guests at all camps.And i fished the lake aline during that spawn and never saw a lical boat.So i can kinda tell you tgat tge crappie population will definatly come out ahead.We took 30 fish home and thats all i know of coming from Cedar.During the summer and fall i noticed the crappies population was there in huge numbers. So IF border opens my prediction will be good fishing for all species on all lakes.
6513986,Eckohlt,2021-01-05 04:18:00,3685,May be alittle different on edwards as 3000 walleyes will have sore lips from your ice fishing jigs john lol
6513998,tv4fish,2021-01-05 05:00:00,2694,"I think it is only logical that there will be/should be a higher number of and slightly larger fish in the lakes that were previously heavily fished by Americans, i.e. Lac Seul, etc. As was said - all the fish up ""there"" do grow slow, so I don't think the average size is going to be increased dramatically........"
6514030,Bill Krejca,2021-01-05 07:48:00,6107,"As I had stated previously, as youngster, I found the fishing on LOW around Turtle Portage was just completely outstanding after WWII. For 3-5 years, tourist numbers had been way down, and most of the locals of fishing age were at war. The numbers caught were outstanding. I don't remember many large walleyes, I think this was the case due to netting operations, which do selectively cull the size. (More larger walleyes are available today, due to little netting in some areas, and size changes) Thousands of fishermen and little limit size rules by the 1960's resulted in drastic reductions of caught fish. After some changes in limit, size, etc, the fishing got better until netting again reduced populations. Peaks and valleys in fish populations occur due to all of the above. It has been my guess, as John pointed out, larger crappies populations and sizes would be expected, to some degree, due to more spawners not being taken. Bill"
6514050,prov1800,2021-01-05 08:56:00,5010,Tell you what Bill its going to be fun finding out.During that crappie spawn which lasts a solid week and maybe a bit about every fisherman at all camps on cedar fish them.At 15 fish per person pluss what gets eaten and then taken home thats a lot of fish iam thinking.Most guys give up on crappies after the spawn as they are harder to catch so thats a good thing.I have a feeling my wife and i will get another chance to fish them this coming season again without any competitiòn again. As well as the smallmouth population whuch also got a break..Last fall fishing Cedar the action for walleye and crappies was fantastic.Size wise you couldnt tell as fish just dont grow that fast.Will be a interesting year fishing them.Muskie fishing seemed very good to as they didnt see a lot of lures and were eager to jump on anything thrown out to them. 4+ more months will tell what will happen and get more info if there is a plan to let people in the country.Will be interesting.Iam hoping for the best scenario.I could a full season of guiding and camps definatly will need some business.
6514054,prov1800,2021-01-05 08:59:00,5010,Rod you know iam gentle with them.
