4560857,Timber Edge,2016-02-19 08:21:00,8,"Fishing in Ontario is great with all the above posts here is another option for you to check out, timberedgecamps.com on Butterfly/Minnitaki Lake over 46,000 acres of water on the english river system with boat access to Abrams, Pelican, Botsford, and Lac Seul (130,000 additional acres) let me know if you have any questions it is a drive in on good paved roads"
4561033,prov1800,2016-02-19 09:01:00,5010,"Lots of suggestions and goid ones.but since your first timers i would suggest a smaller lake to start on and get your feet wet slowly.Big lakes are definatly awesome but would be overwhelming and possibly bad weather could keep you from going out.I see you said quality over qauntity.what is your version of quality, Numbers can be found most everywhere with a few quality fish here and there.I would suggest looking at clarkes northern lights resort, not a huge lake and easy navigation.great boats and free bait.If your looking for a a place with qaulity and willibg to give up numbers check out lost bay resort on cliff lake with good smallmouth; lake trout and muskies also."
4568417,Babamel2,2016-02-21 15:00:00,414,"After you have selected the lake of choice, start making lists of things you feel you need to take with you. If you plan to return in following years, take the list with you and keep editing it as you go through the week in Canada. Keep three different lists, food & cooking supplies, fishing and boat needs, tools and travel (keep in mind breakdowns happen). Enjoy"
4489226,P&y only,2016-01-26 19:08:00,133,"My opinion is apparently a little different than most. I've found that generally speaking the further north I went, the better the fishing got!"
4489962,ftfarms,2016-01-27 04:52:00,444,I started north of red lake years ago and worked several lakes from there south. There's alot of great fishing lakes in canada. But I never found that to be true for us.
4490210,Walleye will,2016-01-27 06:21:00,218,Check out the red lake chain. Might be on the long side for driving but great fishing.
4495986,Baseline,2016-01-28 20:36:00,3207,"Lake of the Woods out of Morson would be a great first trip. I usually fish out of Red Wing right out of Morson, but I've heard a lot of good things about Obobikon. If you want to have a wide variety of resorts to pick from and talk to the owners of various resorts take a weekend road trip to the Northwest Sports Show in Minneapolis. Something for everyone available there. Show is usually in late March."
4496114,Eric.hallagan,2016-01-28 22:06:00,32,"Obabikon- Obabikon and more Obabikon.Amasons Obabikon Bay Love the place, others up north are great too- but it's all in one spot- several species and great chances at a trophy! Jared will take great care of you!"
4504577,Fisher-man,2016-02-01 10:56:00,422,"But better get on it, those resorts fill up fast. Try Lac Seul Lodge. Great accomodations, great people, and great location on the lake. They have 18' boats, fully rigged, with 60hp outboards, and you can go east or west depending on what the weather does. And, if you know anything about walleye fishing you will find fish at all the usual spots. And great scenery."
4505233,Larbo,2016-02-01 15:52:00,231,I will take NW Ontario every time over a US Lake. And yes I have many favorite US lakes such as Leech and Detroit area lakes. To the original poster I would just read some older post's. Good Luck!
4505921,bowhunter99,2016-02-01 20:04:00,218,"have you thought about saskatchewan 1. Last mountain Lake - ice fishing catch and release record walleye- species. pike, carp big ones g and s marina outfitters is great http://www.gsmarina.com/guidesandpackages.html -2. tobin lake world record walleye 3. diefenbaker world record rainbow and bourbot - you could also go further north and catch fish all day long - i live between last mountain and deifenbaker let me know if you have any questions... what time of year"
4509177,Kouki7,2016-02-02 19:07:00,426,Fished the NW Angle (LOW) a few times and really enjoyed the flexibility of fishing Minnesota waters or up into Ontario. Going back again this year.Suggest youngs bay or angle outpost resort.
4509457,Karloutdoors,2016-02-02 19:56:00,828,"Hard to argue LOW but Ill add Wabigoon to the mix. Walleye, Perch, Smallies, Pike Muskies. Like LOW, many places to get out of the wind and still be on fish should she start kicking. Easy to get to."
4487874,aptar,2016-01-26 12:16:00,8,"Hi Guys. I've spent hours combing through all of the posts in the Canada board. I'm looking to setup my first fishing trip to Canada. Our party would be between 2-4 people and would like to spend a week at an outfitter. We would be driving up from the Fargo/Moorhead area, so we're looking for places that we'd be able to drive to in one day. It looks like Ontario has a lot of lakes with outfitters. Is there a good area/lake with solid multi-species fishing that would be a good fit for a first-timer? We are after quality, not quantity. Any input on this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."
4487946,Obabikon,2016-01-26 12:32:00,2370,Lake of the Woods is one of the best multi species lakes in the world.... and probably half a day's drive from you.
4488178,Bill Krejca,2016-01-26 13:49:00,6107,"You can put in near Morson and go to Obabikon's, you'll enjoy yourself! Bill"
4488218,adempsey,2016-01-26 14:07:00,963,"Coming from Fargo, heading up to somewhere in Manitoba would be my choice. Are you interested in a fly in, boat in or just a drive in lodge?"
4488298,Dwinger,2016-01-26 14:49:00,29,I'll second that! Lake of the Woods is a world class fishery. Lake of the woods can be intimidating because of its size so bring lake maps and good GPS units.
4488314,aptar,2016-01-26 14:55:00,8,We would be looking at a drive in lodge on this trip.
4488466,ftfarms,2016-01-26 15:46:00,444,I would also say lake of the woods. I've fished several lakes in ontario and lake of the woods has become my favorite by far. We've caught big crappie big walleye big pike Hugh bass. I haven't stayed with Jared at obabikon but I've talk with him on the phone a few times great guy to talk with and his resort is in a great area. So I will also recommend staying at amisons obabikon lodge. Just give Jared a call.
4488610,GBS,2016-01-26 16:39:00,2271,"I posted before, but one place to consider is:Grass River Lodge in Manitoba. http://www.grassriverlodge.com/While they market for big northern, the walleye and lake trout fishing is also supburb. They also do one day fly-outs to remote lakes, so you can work on hitting a 100 walleye day.Full day drive north from Winnipeg.Full service - 3 meals (shore lunch every day) Guides for every 2 people for the entire trip Great cabin accommodations, with coffee delivery each morning. Ike (the owner) owns, services, and pilots his small fleet of airplanes, which keeps their costs way down.I set the record a couple of years ago with a 52"" Northern. Now they are boasting a few 53's each season. Fish in the 40's were very common - each of us caught several a day. Nobody worried about whether we had walleye for lunch until about 1/2 hour before it was time to eat!Not the cheapest place, but given the service level, much less than the really deluxe places. Caribou, bear, lynx, etc. all around. As wilderness as you can get, without flying.The fun part was at dinner, where they go around and have each group talk about their day - what was biting, what they were using, where they went, etc. so that everyone could quickly zero in on the best methods. Since they are the only lodge there, no need to keep secrets!"
