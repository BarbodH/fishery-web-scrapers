4568537,emma17,2016-02-21 15:42:00,436,"Eyeman You've picked a fantastic camp as they all go above and beyond in providing excellent service. My wife and I have gone there in mid August the last two years. We find plenty of Walleye and Smallies in typical places. My wife caught her first Musky in a bay just around the corner from Witch Bay. Our last evening we fished from the pier and caught Walleye, Perch, Crappie and Northern. The camp is at the end of a bay with a nice weed line for quick access to pike. We always use jigs- my wife prefers purple and does well- I stick w chartreuse. We have good luck w rattle traps when not jigging. Leaches and minnows are our go-to but worms and plastics have also worked. I look forward to hearing about your trip. We hope to return again in August."
4568593,KM1,2016-02-21 15:55:00,374,"from July 1st to the 17th...so same time as you. As others have said...Witch Bay is a GREAT camp. Been to others...won't go anywhere else now. Steve and Gail are AWESOME and very customer friendly always looking to make sure their clientele is happy. We, my brother and I, have fished the lake for several years. Mainly for walleye...and some small mouth. Last summer...480 walleye with a good number over 26"" and the largest 10.5lbs 29.5-30."" Since we will be up there at the same time...on days you want to fish walleye you are welcome to follow us out. Might take a couple days to pattern the fish, depending on ice out and conditions, but more than willing to fish along with others in the camp. You bringing your own boat? Renting? Best, Kirk"
4584353,eyeman_1,2016-02-26 09:55:00,690,"Kirk, Thanks for the info. I shot you a PM too if you want to chat. I see you are in Naperville too.. I'm on the fence about bringing my boat because I just had some spinal fusion done and not sure if I'll feel like doing all the prep work to go to Canada... I'll know more after I try to do it for our annual Lake Erie trip the end of April / first of May... If not my other buddy may bring his Alumacraft and the other buddy is bringing his Ranger. Thanks again."
4587337,bellbuoy,2016-02-27 08:26:00,490,"My wife and I and my buddy and his wife will be there 7/18 to 7/23, my 7th trip. I've not found a better place nor better service anywhere. Ask Gail's son Adam about the muskie that prefers 17 inch smallmouth bass!"
4561929,eyeman_1,2016-02-19 12:00:00,690,"We are heading to LOTW - Witch Bay the first week of July with 5 adults and 4 teenagers for their first Canadian fishing excursion. The adults are multi species fisherman and would like to pursue muskie, pike, bass, and of course walleye. We've fished over in the Big Narrows area the last several years but wanted to try something different this year. Can anyone provide us some info on the fishing in this area of LOTW? On the surface(pun intended) the water appears to be the same structure wise, and it's the same time of year. I would think we would be looking to fish the same types of structures as the other side of the lake. If anyone has any advice on best baits, colors, structures or locations to be on the lookout for, I'd really appreciate any advice. Thanks."
4562177,fishpoop,2016-02-19 13:15:00,630,"I can't give advice because I've not been to Witch Bay. I can tell you that there are some nice videos on youtube that were shot at Witch Bay Camp. Bob Meshiskomer (sp?) Linder's Angling Edge, have shot video's there, also the camp too has a couple of videos. So do a little digging around on youtube and see what you find. Hope that helps give you some info."
4562201,eyeman_1,2016-02-19 13:19:00,690,"Fish, Thanks. Been watching the Mesikomer video's and others from Witch Bay. They also provide some educational stuff at the camp and review maps. We are just trying to cover all the bases so the kids will have plenty to keep them occupied and we all catch a bunch."
4562225,fishpoop,2016-02-19 13:24:00,630,"Looks like my reply didn't do you much good after all. Oh well, I tried. lol You already know about the video's. I've thought about going there myself. Good luck on the trip"
4562281,eyeman_1,2016-02-19 13:46:00,690,"I appreciate you letting us know. We've been looking into this place for a few years and finally decided to pull the trigger. I've not heard a bad word about them thus far. I'm also taking my father who's going to be 74 while we are there. He's never caught a muskie so I'm really going with that as my goal. He's had any number of follows and caught big eyes and pike while muskie fishing both with me and with guides, he's just, for whatever reason not caught one. This may be one of the last chances I get to put him on one so, I'm going to work hard for him to hook up. The boys will have a ball I think catching pike and bass, and from what we are told they can catch pike from the dock or near the camp all day long. That will be great for them, and if the weather goes south, we can run them into town for an afternoon. Otherwise the other place we have stayed was an hour boat ride tot he island and we were pretty much there for the week. Fishing was always fantastic, and accomodations were always good. Just needed a new adventure."

4563793,@Lunker,2016-02-19 22:02:00,835,"I'll be back there first week in June, my 40th trip or so over the past 22 years. That time of year, fishing & location will be dependent on progression of the season.....how warm is the water getting over time.....and it's all relative. Northerns will be exiting the shallows and retreating to deeper water. Rule of thumb up there is that muskie's start to turn on as water temps approach 70 degrees.....which is early to mid-July. Smallies could still be up shallow but starting to move just a bit deeper as the water warms. If they're not in skinny water, look for them toward the first breakline offshore. Walleyes will be moving offshore toward deeper mid-lake flats, breaks, and humps. But don't overlook the shallows for them first thing in the morning and in the evening when the sun is low. Jig and crawlers, leeches, or plastics will work for both walleyes and smallies. #7 Shadraps are effective for smallies. 3/4 oz tandem spinners or #5 Mepps spinners are effective for all species, especially when you dress the blades with prism tape. You'll be well taken care of and you're going to have a blast."
