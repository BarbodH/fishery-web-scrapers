4584737,Larbo,2016-02-26 11:07:00,231,I have fished LOTW's around the Big Narrows area for muskies a couple times in early October.July - September I tend to cast all day. When I go that late in the year I spend 50%- 60% of the time trolling. The fish are fat and I think they fight harder.
4586985,fishpoop,2016-02-27 07:06:00,630,"As I said in my first post on page 1 I haven't stayed at Witch Bay nor have I fished that section of the lake. I have been to the N.W. Angle and Sabaskong Bay during the summer. I've done some digging around for info for late fall muskie fishing on L.o.T.W. and most everything I come up with indicates more of a trolling bite than casting for muskies. Primarily troll the first breakline in about 10 to 15 feet of water. Troll lures like 10 inch Believers, Grandma lures or Jakes and bang them off the rocks on points, humps, saddles, etc, cover water and sooner or later you should get bit by a big muskie or pike. In Fisherman has had many articles about fall muskie/pike fishing on the Woods. All videos are of fall muskie trolling on Lake of The Woods. http://www.in-fisherman.com/tv/troll-time-muskies/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCtzj2SoYf0https://www.youtube.com/user/MyliesPlaceResort Hope this helps."
4588409,fishpoop,2016-02-27 17:06:00,630,There's 2 Witch Bay threads going at the same time. I thought I was replying to the other one.
4588729,Blades-n-Beads,2016-02-27 18:51:00,484,"Wolf1931, I have not stayed with witch bay but have heard all good at that camp. You would be fishing the Andrews Bay area, I have stayed with the camp that is approx 10 miles from witch bay many many times. Actually fish the Andrews Bay area 3 times a year. June, July and August. My personal best walleye came out of Andrews, 32.5, 31.5 and 31. Largest pike 40, largest musky at 51. You will not be disappointed. Throw in the summo perch and you'll have a ball. Mid July and late August is my favorite time of year in Andrews. Never have fished that late into October but I would assume trolling big baits and covering some ground is spot on for that time of year. Blades"
4589449,Guest,2016-02-28 04:54:00,0,"guys thanks again for all the good tips will work the 15 ft break lines trolling (easier on shoulder) but will mix in casting also especially on the back side of a point where the wind is blowing into another good point was that skis many times hunt in packs of 4-5 so one missing your plug another cast back into the same area I always thought it was the same fish but evidently could be a ""another ski"" from same pack interesting will pick up some of the suggested plugs for trolling will definitely work Andrews bay a few days thanks again jim wolf Chicago boys also going up for a family get together in late august for a week to Phillips Wisconsin to world famous lac vieux lake for tiger muskies owner told me a tiger muskie is a cross from a silver female ski and a northern and that they are arch enemies competing for food"
4580497,Guest,2016-02-25 07:01:00,0,"fellow fishermen planning possibly a trip to this camp 2nd week of October (talked to owner gail on phone nice lady) we have never fished this late in the season weather in 50's during day ?? would like to do some ski fishing but not all day (just too much casting for me) probably 50% walleyes 50% northern and muskie fishing will have camp to ourselves in October can we realistically catch 25 walleyes/man/day fish hard 12 hr days chance for a 40""+ northern and muskie my personal best over 40 trips to Canada 27"" walleye 39"" northern and 35"" muskie stopped going to lotw in 80's because was difficult owner claims conservation limits and restocking have improved conditions they are on a secluded 7 mile bay no resorts within 10 miles appreciate any comments jim wolf Chicago boys"
4581105,emma17,2016-02-25 09:56:00,436,"I've not been to Witch Bay in October, only August a couple of times- and love the camp. I know there are a couple fish not far from camp much larger than the personal bests you want to beat. They have my bass lures in their mouths. As for Walleye, we've caught numbers but have not had luck w size. I believe fully that the conservation efforts will lead to bigger fish each year. We have caught several 25+ Walleye in other parts of LOW in last 2 years."
4581217,JohnWF,2016-02-25 10:29:00,129,"Jim: I have no experience with Witch Bay Camp since I stay in the Sioux Narrows area. However, I fish the waters north of Aulneau in the fall. September and October are becoming my favorite times to be on Lake of the Woods. Yes, you can easily have 25 walleye days. Occasional larger fish, but mostly under 18'. However, You will need to move around to find them. They seem to bunch up in the fall. I see some pretty nice muskies then as well as northerns. I think the overall fish population is strong, but I think they get more larger walleyes in the Big Traverse area.Bring lots of gas money and explore the lake. Like all fishing, some days are big and others not so much. There is very little boat traffic in October. I see more deer hunters than fishermen. Having a group with more than one boat, with communication, might be beneficial in the event of a mishap if you wander far. Weather can be anything. Prepare for wind, cold rain or even snow. Could be warm and calm, too. Leaves may be gone by then and it makes the whole environment look different. Strongly recommend a GPS/SONAR with mapping of Lake of the Woods and good paper maps, too. Having a GPS screen that is big enough to read while underway is a nice feature, also. I have a full top set for my boat and that is really nice when the weather turns crappy.John"
4581353,Knutson21,2016-02-25 11:08:00,348,At that time of the year if you get Temps in the 50's during the day I think it would be a win. I have been on Lake of the woods in September with the high only in the low 40's.
4582289,Obabikon,2016-02-25 16:49:00,2370,"Could be snowing, could be t-shirt weather. Temps that time of year are pretty unpredictable. Fishing should be phenomenal either way!"
4583233,Guest,2016-02-26 03:52:00,0,fellow fishermen always you guys are always so knowledgeable thanks for the comments will bring extra clothing I think it is worth for the chance at some superior fishing jim wolf Chicago boys
4583329,Baseline,2016-02-26 05:34:00,3207,"Weather is hit or miss in October. My guess it would be a miss. Wind is usually an issue in mid-October and wind on LOW is an issue. You won't have much competition for spots. Fall walleyes are usually very cooperative. There can also be a bonus of some hot crappie fishing. I'm not much of a musky fisherman, but the hardcores are out there. A lot of them troll for them."
4583537,Ruddiger,2016-02-26 06:42:00,649,"Howdy, How does the water clarity on that part of LOTW compare to the water clarity around Obabikon? Clearer, darker, the same? Take care, Ruddiger"
4583545,Bill Krejca,2016-02-26 06:43:00,6107,"Should be a great adventure. Landscape may look a little different that time of year, especially Oct. I have some neat pictures of pure yellow shorelines. The latest I've been on LOW (have not been near Witchbay) was mid-Oct.; we camped out, ending up bringing back the same ice in a small cooler which I had brought from home the week before. Going up , got stuck in MN gas station, pulling boat in snow storm. No snow the rest of the week, though. Bill"
4583649,Obabikon,2016-02-26 07:27:00,2370,"Should be pretty similar. Maybe a little clearer up north... but that time of year, both are dark and clean."
