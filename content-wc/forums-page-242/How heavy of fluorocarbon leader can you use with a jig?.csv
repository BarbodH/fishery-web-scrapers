If heavy into pike in an area, I switch to a light wire leader, which I make myself. Normally this would be a spot where weeds are thick, and I feel the wire is more of a non factor on bites in such an area. Bill"
4504145,camp chef,2016-02-01 08:09:00,915,I use a snap swivel to connect the jig to my mono. Saw jobs are reduced by 90%. I can't remember the last time I got sawed while using a snap swivel.
4504393,Mike Borger,2016-02-01 09:15:00,1554,"That's a really excellent idea, I'll bet you're right!"
4591449,greenie,2016-02-28 15:43:00,87,With 10/4lb. Fireline I use 6lb. fluoro or 6lb. camo colored mono. I have these all made up in advance with small barrel swivel on.
4592585,Algoma Guy,2016-02-28 21:12:00,48,"This does work.....I normally don't recommend it but you are right about 90% of the time the swivel ends up right in the corner of the pikes mouth. Other than that I use a 20lb 24""piece of flouro attached to barrel swivel."
4593249,rocko0305,2016-02-29 07:51:00,138,"As already mentioned, tying braid directly to the jig does nothing to lessen the bite offs. I've had a lot of success using a 15# or 20# fluorocarbon leader. The 20# works very well and as long as you're using a jig that is 1/4 oz. or heavier, I haven't seen an issue with it effecting the action. I'm usually casting out a swimbait for walleye instead of traditional jigging, and the leader has worked great. The only issue is the extra time it takes to tie the leader on when all you want to do is get a lure back in the water if you do happen to get the leader nicked up or bit off. I have occasionally used a snap swivel attached directly to braid, and it does seem to lessen the bite offs as well. The snap swivel is nice to change out swimbaits quickly as well."
4593585,Koliver1922,2016-02-29 09:25:00,80,Does the snap swivel idea work with lightweight jigs (like 1/16oz) tipped with a minnow or leech?
4593761,camp chef,2016-02-29 10:40:00,915,It should. I use it on 1/8 oz jigs.The walleyes don't seem to mind.
4594585,Little John,2016-02-29 15:46:00,7,"I jig with a 6'3"" Icon. I have 20 pound test braid and use a 15 pound fluorocarbon. I have caught 11+ pound lake trout, and numerous 7+ pound walleye all jigging. The floro is invisible when in the water. I would think you could use what ever size floro you would want as long as you can't see it. I still have bite offs but don't run into to many pike. If it was my problem I would up the strength of the floro till I solved the problem or just use the swivel. JMHO. LJ"
4502817,wmd,2016-01-31 16:25:00,388,We fish kids predominately in Canada with 8-10 lb Fireline Crystal and have been using 8-10 lb fluorocarbon leader material with a small barrel swivel. We have been getting too many bite offs with Northerns. How heavy of fluorocarbon material can a person use without affecting the action of the jig and still greatly reduce the bite offs? Thanks wmd
4502993,clearis,2016-01-31 16:50:00,47,"This isn't a direct answer. If the northerns are biting off the fluro leader, I remove it and just fish straight braid. In stained water, which is characteristic of walleye lakes in northern Ontario, I generally find little difference with or without a fluro leader. If it is calm with bright sun and the bit is slow, fluro can make a difference. But, if they are biting, it really doesn't matter. Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk"
4503001,maddie,2016-01-31 16:52:00,42,"Why bother ,I used to fish the same way where we go in Quebec until we did a comparison and found the walleye were not line shy there at all. Now the jig goes right on the fire line ."
4503033,kzoofisher,2016-01-31 16:58:00,5144,I've never found braid to be very abrasion resistant so I would go with a light wire leader and if my bite rate drops too much 20# leader. If neither of them work I'd take extra jigs.
4503057,adempsey,2016-01-31 17:09:00,963,"I don't think it will make any difference on jig action based on what line you use since you're using a barrel swivel. That's likely where your jig action will be impacted. Unless I misunderstood what you wrote and you're actually tying directly to the jig? In which case you would just use a knot like a Rapala knot, but the max diameter of the line should still be less than the diameter of the jig hole. Personally, I do what kzoofisher suggested."
4503193,Mike Borger,2016-01-31 17:34:00,1554,I always use either 10 or 12lb fluoro tippet off the end of my braid when jigging.Side note but tying your jig directly to braid will not decrease bite offs. Fish bite through braid like a hot knife through butter.
4503249,wmd,2016-01-31 17:45:00,388,"Thanks for your replies. Mike i see the same results when tieing directly to braid, 10-12 ib flour is heavy enough to reduce the northern biteoffs? I was toying with the idea of going to 15-20 floor leader material. I wasn't clear apparently I tie 24"" or so of flouro leader to barrel swivel with 8-10 lb Fireline Crystal. Thanks wmd"
4503473,ftfarms,2016-01-31 19:42:00,444,I've always used 10# fluorocarbon and a small swivel. Never had a problem. Gotta love the no line twist though. I think if I went back to all fluorocarbon or mono I would put a swivel 3 feet above the jig there also.
4503545,Mike Borger,2016-01-31 20:26:00,1554,"You're still going to get bite offs with 10-12lb fluoro. Most often I just live with it. On the very odd occasion it's gotten so bad that I had to do something. For me a short length of very thin tieable 12lb titanium made by knot 2 kinky is a better alternative than heavier fluoro or a wire leader. I use a tiny swivel to connect braid to titanium, then tie the jig directly to the titanium. http://www.aquateko.com/Knot_2_Kinky..._p/nt00815.htm"
4503713,roscoe33,2016-01-31 23:25:00,653,"No matter what you use, flouro, fireline, braid, you will be stripping off a few feet of line and retying after the line gets nicked up a bit. So do what is easiest for you. I get less bite-offs with power pro compared to fireline, but use both on different rods for different uses."
