Early in the month last August, I measured the temperature of the lake's water as a function of depth. I measured 65 degrees F. at 24 feet and 57 degrees F at a depth of 28 feet. The depth of water where the measurements were recorded was about sixty fow. I have recorded the depth of the thermocline in this particular body of water on many occasions. I would rate the above data as being representative of other years. I was surprised at first that the thermocline was this deep. Turnover (loss of thermocline) typically takes place on this body of water in mid to late September. I don't have a lot of data earlier in the season, but suspect that the thermocline is established in mid to late June and develops (i.e. moves deeper) throughout July. I hope the above information is helpful. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
