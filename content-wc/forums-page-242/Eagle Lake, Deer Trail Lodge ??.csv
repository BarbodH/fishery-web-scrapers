I know it is no longer, due to family and health issue of the owners (Mann's ?? ). Does anyone know if the facility is still operating and under what name? Just curious what ever happened to it? maybe you v-bay gord? Have a great memory of hooking into a monster muskie while perch fishing in front of the dock. It pulled me around in the canoe until half the line was stripped from the reel. Then made a glorious leap into the air and snapped the line. I've still got that glass Garcia rod and Zebco 600 reel."

4568129,drlee,2016-02-21 13:36:00,409,"First stayed at Deer Trail Lodge, I think in 1987, my first trip to Canada. Ron Booi, Sr. was the owner and I believe Ron Jr. was with him at the time. Sr. had, I think, been divorced and his ex ended up with their fly in camp. They were only there for a couple of years and then sold to Marie Gold and her husband, who owned a cabin right next door. They were from southern Ontario and he supplied parts to Chevrolet. The second year they were in the camp, he was killed in a car accident. Marie determined to continue to run the lodge and with the help of an old family friend, Ian, did so very well. We continued to fish there until Eagle went through its serious over fished period and then we moved on. I really missed the lake and Marie and Ian who became good friends. They eventually got married. I believe Marie passed on a number of years ago and I would guess Ian is likely gone, as well, though I don't know that for sure. I talked to the owners at the All Canada show in Green Bay a short time ago and we had a nice visit. Ron Booi, Sr. was famous for filleting walleyes with a broad axe at a time when All Canada shows were huge productions. I think Ron Jr. and his spouse are now running a lodge on Trout Lake, a fly in. I think Sr. is gone now. If my history lesson contains any inaccurate info, I apologize. Just working from old memories."

It's funny, because it looks like this ""family tradition"" has continued on. Jim Booi shows you how to fillet a Walleye with a ""Booi"" knife on their website."
4568889,v-bay gord,2016-02-21 17:16:00,3168,Pretty much accurate.....Marie and Ian were good folk. I'm not totally sure on Ian's status but you are probably right that's he's gone too.
4569385,roscoe33,2016-02-21 19:23:00,653,"Seems like a lot of bad luck surrounding the owners of that lodge.Possibly haunted? or cursed?I know the Mann's sure had their share, first with one son, then the other, and possible the dad, can't remember now.My uncle was a buddy of his, but he has passed too, so I can't ask him.From the google maps image, looks like the campground is gone. New development on that land."
