I was wondering at this time of year where should i concentrate my efforts in catching walleye. What sort of presentation is the best at this time of year . ie should i be using minnows , worms , jigging or trolling?"
4560249,kzoofisher,2016-02-19 03:08:00,5144,Jigs with plastic or minnows depending on preference. Trolling is never a bad way to locate fish but I'm sure the lodge can put you in good bays and which river mouths are best.

In mid-June, the Walleye are likely transitioning between the spawning areas and their summer locations. This depends on forage base and water temperature. So, they may be hanging near the river mouths waiting for the water temperature to rise or are already on their way to the structure near deeper water. If there is plenty of food around though, they aren't going anywhere.Ideally, you should find out where they were being caught the two weeks prior. That will give you an idea where to start. This year has been especially warm, so it may be by mid-June they may already be on a summer pattern. If you find the main lake basin is already over 72F, they probably are. Wenebegon is relatively shallow, so I imagine it warms up reasonably quickly.Wenebegon has two main rivers coming in from the north end, The Little Wenebegon and the Wenebegon Rivers. These are likely primary spawning locations. There are several others that might be used for spawning as well (marked on this map). The Wenebegon also flows out at the south end, where spawning may occur, but it's typically done upstream. So, if you are fishing blind, it's probably not a bad idea to start fishing shallow (<6 FOW) in the bays near these river and stream inlets. If you're not having success, progressively move away [into nearby deeper water first] and toward the main lake basin, fishing offshore structure, rock piles and weedbeds that fish may be holding at as the migrate to the summer locations.Jig and minnow, slip bobbers and cranks should all work."
