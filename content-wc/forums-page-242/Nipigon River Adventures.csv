4557889,3M TA3,2016-02-18 09:26:00,2846,Looks like I've set up a 3 day trip in June with the folks at NRA in Red Rock. Anyone have any experience with them or their Lodge. I'll be going after big Specks on the Nipigon River and was hoping you folks out there may have some experience with them that you can comment on or recommendations. Thanks

Can you tell us a little about how they work. I assume they link you to a guide. What about boats? Their website looks more like a traditional hotel booking site.B-

A big issue you will face is a lack of local guides. I notice Gord Ellis is listed as a guide. He won't be cheap but it will be the trip of a lifetime if you can afford him for a couple of days. Randy Beamish has guided for them in the past but like Gord, he is from Thunder Bay - more than an hour from the river. Both have other jobs so booking will be an issue. I fish the river every few years myself but we just book into a hotel right in Nipigon. If you are trying to do it yourself be careful. There are some ""interesting"" stretches of water. PS if you are fishing with either of these guys you will not be keeping any brook trout. It is a ver special fishery and needs to be treated as such. If you want a fish to eat, the resident rainbows in the lower sections of the river are great table fare."

4563273,Fishingfinn,2016-02-19 18:13:00,30,"Im from Thunder Bay and fish the river a few times a year, mainly for salmon on the lower stretch south of Alexander Dam. If you haven't fished it before, a guide would be a beneficial. The river can be nasty. Check this guy out if you don't already have someone booked. I don't know much about him, only that he's one of the few guys guiding right out of Nipigon/Red Rockhttp://hardcorefishing.org"
4572457,3M TA3,2016-02-22 18:46:00,2846,"OK folks. thanks for the input. Spending a few days at NRA and Gord Ellis will be our guide. Keeping fish is not a priority at all, rarely keep them now days. I hope to catch at least one nice one, a really nice one, but I'm really looking forward to the entire experience along with a really great friend. Thanks again."
