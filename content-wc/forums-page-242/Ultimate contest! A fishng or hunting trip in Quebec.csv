4520489,Shellback,2016-02-06 05:39:00,8083,Strange question to ask!
4520537,Mike Borger,2016-02-06 06:14:00,1554,Yeah it's been like that for as long as I can remember. And it's not 1+1 either. Unless you're a rainman it's something that makes you go running for a calculator LOL!
4520761,Shellback,2016-02-06 07:15:00,8083,That rule wouldn't last a second in the US. There would be a multitude of lawsuits crying foul!
4520769,Shellback,2016-02-06 07:16:00,8083,I'm in!!!!
4521049,v-bay gord,2016-02-06 09:23:00,3168,So does that mean when I win I have to go to the U.S. to catch my flight??

4516353,Andre (wallyandre),2016-02-04 18:27:00,2274,Don't miss the chance to win a fishing or a hunting trip to some of the top outfitters in the province of Quebec. http://quebecultimatedestination.com/Choose fishing or hunting!
4516761,Mike Borger,2016-02-04 19:48:00,1554,Cool contest! I find it slightly ironic that it's only open to US citizens. I'm about to launch a contest to have someone join me on a trip to Great Slave Lake in the NWT and for legal reasons I can't include citizens of Quebec LOL!
4516825,Andre (wallyandre),2016-02-04 20:04:00,2274,What are those legal reasons? By the way the Ultimate contest is a super contest!
4516913,Mike Borger,2016-02-04 20:30:00,1554,"In order for contests to be open to residents of the province, Quebec law requires that the companies sponsoring the contest must do the following things:Register the contest rules and all advertisements used to promote the contest with the Quebec government at least 30 days ahead of the contest launch.Pay a fee of up to 10% of the contest's value, depending on who is allowed to enter.Agree to allow the government of Quebec to mediate any lawsuits arising from the contest.Follow strict guidelines about the contents of the contest rules.Allow the Quebec government to determine if the contest may be changed or canceled once it has started.File a written report after the contest has concluded, attesting that the prizes have been delivered or attempted to be delivered.Agree to follow a number of other rules and guidelines.These requirements make it difficult for anyone to include Quebec residents.I thought perhaps the federal government might have followed suit with a set of rules of their own making it impossible for us to enter Quebec based contests."
4516945,Andre (wallyandre),2016-02-04 20:43:00,2274,What is the value of the prize?A lot of words that doesn't mean that much. I know because I organize a contest some years ago and I went through thisThat has been put in place to protect the consumer against fraud.
4517041,retire55,2016-02-04 21:16:00,1029,"Here's an excerpt from the Official Rules: Open to legal U.S. citizens, residing in the United States and legal Canadian citizens, residing in Canada, except for residents of Qu√©bec. Canadian law requires that selected Canadian residents correctly answer a mathematical skill-testing question to win."
4517153,Andre (wallyandre),2016-02-04 22:06:00,2274,I just correct the original post.
4517569,Mike Borger,2016-02-05 06:46:00,1554,That's kind of funny. Quebec residents can't enter their own contest.
4519649,Andre (wallyandre),2016-02-05 17:17:00,2274,It's because we want to give you more chances to win
4520097,yoopertrout,2016-02-05 20:54:00,1172,Cool contest! Thanks for posting it.
