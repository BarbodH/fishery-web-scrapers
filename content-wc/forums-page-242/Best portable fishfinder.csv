4568105,packpro,2016-02-21 13:35:00,695,"This Garmin 240 is going on it's 20th Canadian trip this year. I made it portable when I bought it. Cut off the end of the power leads, Kept the in line fuse. Put small alligator clips on the power leads. I can run it off a portable 12V battery that stores behind the handle, of I can run off the boat battery. I get a full day off the portable 12V. Made the box a few years ago. Copied some designs that I found here on WC. Switched from a clamp mount to a suction cup. Only had one issue with a slimy, painted boat. Wiped off the slime, all good. From what I understand black and white displays will use less power that Color. Smaller screen will also save power. I have a portable GPS so I am not sure what that additional draw that would be. I still get great results with this unit. Shows fish marks, bottom structure and fairly detailed weeds formations. Uses an Air mark transducer."

4562649,adempsey,2016-02-19 15:22:00,963,"You can make any sonar portable. Can't go wrong with Humminbird or Lowrance. I think the prices on sonars are amazing these days. I should probably pick up a new one myself. The Humminbird PiranhaMAX 197c is a decent basic color sonar. The 542 isn't bad, but I'd stick with color at this point. The Helix-5 Sonar is really nice, big screen, price is ~$350 which isn't too bad, but definitely one of the more expensive portable models.For Lowrance the Hook-3x and Elite-3x are your options. No clue what makes these two models different, but I think the Hook-3x is the current model. One step up is the Hook-4x, which has a higher resolution screen. The Hook-4 also has models with Chartplotting and downscan if you want those features. If you need a bigger screen, you have to move up to the Hook-5x series. I think the Garmin Striker 4 looks like a good deal. Small screen though. Otherwise, the Garmin Echo 301C looks good. I'd probably stick with Humminbird or Lowrance though. I'd buy any of those personally. The Humminbird Helix-5 Sonar PT stands out though. If you need GPS, you could upgrade the Helix-5 for about $100 or I'd consider the Hook-4, but the Hook-5 would be a better choice if you can budget in the upgrade.An alternative is one of those WiFi sonars that hooks up to your iPad. Not sure how well those work though."
4563473,Erie Ranger620,2016-02-19 19:14:00,74,I am planning a fly in I am thinking about building my own system an lowrance elite 7 gold already loaded with canada lakes and I found this cool set up http://www.fishfindermounts.com/#!product-videos/c2130 a little expensive but a cool setup that will last years
4563737,Wall1,2016-02-19 21:22:00,17,For my use it is hard to beat the hummingbird 385- combo unit with gps.Works great and good battery life. really nice the gps factor. very reasonable and haven't seen a better portable yet
4564297,SteveJ715,2016-02-20 07:44:00,59,"Just got back from an ice fishing trip and we had a couple of these units going, including the Elite 3 and Elite 4 series. I was able to see my lure on the 4 series but not the 3. The point is I would say if you want to see if your lure is down where the fish are you need to buy at least a 4 series...BUT I could be wrong and just not have had the 3 series dialed in properly, I'll admit it. I would appreciate it if one of you tech-savvy guys can set me straight on this because I also am in the market for a new fishfinder/GPS for fly-in lakes and if you can see your line on the new Hook 3 series, for example, that would inform my decision. Great question for the offseason, thanks!- Steve"
4564697,forgop,2016-02-20 10:01:00,880,"This would be hard to beat IMO for price:http://universalmania.com/humminbird...kTQaAh-48P8HAQI have the 385CI that I found for a great price and then had to pay another $100 or so for carrying case, battery, etc."
4564961,damma018,2016-02-20 11:05:00,1,"I am likely going to purchase the Helix 5 SI/GPS combo, but I am willing to spend a little more as it is going to double as my main unit (portability is necessary as I only have a canoe for at least a couple more years). I am going to pair it with one of the mounts from http://www.fishfindermounts.com/ , so it will work for any boats we rent in Canada. GPS is almost necessary as we like to make a lot of longer runs to explore as much of the lake as we can. Side imaging is something I wanted mostly for at home, but will be a nice option to have with. What I am most looking forward to is the option of being able to chart my map for the places that we fish on. We prefer the more remote boat to options so we have not had a place with charted maps available. Regardless of what you go with, I would suggest looking to buy from a marine dealer. Most of the sports stores will have any electronics listed at MSRP, a lot of the marine dealers seem to have them a good 10% under MSRP. A few places online have the Helix 5 SI for $430-450 as opposed to the $500 at Cabelas / Gander."
4565025,Mike Borger,2016-02-20 11:27:00,1554,"I'm not going to offer a specific suggestion. For my needs which is specifically fly in trips, the best option is a low end black and white unit, preferably something that runs on double A batteries. The fancy color graphs with gps suck up too much battery life. Not a problem if there's a generator at camp, or less commonly the boat has electric start and a battery you can use. Most often a simple black and white graph that has water temp is all I need. It's only ever used for finding depth and structure anyway...not fish.GPS comes in handy but I use a small hand held Garmin unit for that which also runs on double A's.A small bag of double A batteries to last the week doesn't weigh a whole lot."
4565393,adempsey,2016-02-20 14:35:00,963,"For fly-ins, this is the best advice. The downside is that I am not even sure they make sonars that use AA's anymore. Of course, you can just assemble you're own battery pack, but it's nice to have a complete package. The units that are designed to work off AA's have ultra-low power consumption too."
4567785,yoopertrout,2016-02-21 12:06:00,1172,"I've used the hand held ice fishing kind. Obviously, they wouldn't work at a high speed. When trying to drift over structure, or back trolling slowly, they work fine, and they are super portable (size of a flashlight.)"
