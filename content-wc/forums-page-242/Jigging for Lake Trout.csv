4567121,buckeye1,2016-02-21 09:23:00,269,Will be in Canana late July for walleye but would like to jig for trout in about 60 feet of water. Looking for advice on tackle and methods.

4568097,adempsey,2016-02-21 13:33:00,963,"Summer tactics are not any different than during hard water season. You don't jig like you do for Walleye. You want smooth long raises, pausing and free fall drops. At times, reeling your line up fast 30+ feet and then letting it free fall again. If you have a good sonar and can keep the boat relatively stationary, you can watch them on the graph and based on how the fish are reacting to your jig you can decide what action to take (jig, reel up fast or drop back down). Of course, if the fish are not in a very active mood, a very subtle jigging on the bottom can also work as well as dead sticking. Also, it's ideal to use a no stretch superline like PowerPro or Fireline. A drift sock is also a good idea. You might even consider bringing your own anchor rope/chain.One of the most effective lures is a 4"" pearl white tube jig. A 1/2 to 3/4 oz. is a good place to start, but you want to choose your weight depending on depth and desired action - heavier for deep water and fast drops; and lighter for shallower and slower falls. You can add a stinger or simply trim some of the tail. A 4"" White grub can also work. Some also swear by white bucktail jigs.Paddletail Swimbaits (solid body) are awesome too. There are plenty that should work from 3"" to 5"" - X-Zone Swammers, Roboworm Robo Minnow, Powerbait Rib Shad, Keitech Swim Impact, Reaction Innovations Dipper.....there are plenty.Lipless Cranks are also popular. These became popular through dead sticking methods in the winter. Still a good lure to jig. The Live Target Shiner, Strike King Red Eye Shad, Rat-L-TRap, Rapala Rippin Rap and Rapala Clackin Rap are all good choices. Again, there are plenty that will work.Blade Baits have been around for a long time. One of my favorite lures. In my area the Sebile Vibrato has become popular, but the Silver Buddy, Reef Runner Cicada, Silver Streak, Heddon Sonar, Vib E, Johnson Thin Fisher etc.. in 1/2oz. + are all good. I've seen some huge 4""+ blade baits for Lake Trout, but haven't tried them.Jigging spoons. Nothing wrong with the old standards like Swedish Pimples, Krocodile Spoons, Crippled Herring and even Little Cleos.Flutter spoons. Great action on the drop and can be used for a more subtle presentation as well. Williams Whitefish and Wablers are great choices.""Weighted Jigs"". Not really sure what to call these, but they work great ice fishing for Whitefish and Lakers. They look like elongated tube jigs, with more weight at the front of the lure. So, when you jig it, the front of the lure will tilt and tap the bottom, somewhat like an equal arm balance with a little more weight on one arm. It's often a more subtle presentation where you just lightly tap the bottom with the jig. A lot are locally made by Bad Boyz and Meegs, but Blue Fox has the Lil' Foxee Jig.Of course, I am more a believer that finding the fish is far more important than what you use to catch them. So, don't focus on the lures etc.. but focus on location and jigging technique. This year I am even going to try some drop-shot for Lakers. Here's a good video on swim bait techniques. Sure, it's ice fishing, but it will work in the summer too.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAfw77mAXbE"

That spot is about 20 minutes from camp. We hit that area right after dinner. They will turn on for about 30-45 minutes as the sun starts to set. Always take a buoy marker. Once you get a hit. throw the marker and work that depth. We generally find them in close proximity to each other, once the feed starts. This is not a subtle jig. We are moving the Jig 2-5 ft. Let it smack the bottom. That is a great attractant. Years ago we has luck with a silver Strata (hammertone) spoon. In the last 8 years a large white jig tipped with a 6"" twister tail plus two dead minnows, has been the hot ticket. Tried to freeze the LT and take them home, they never taste good that way. When we eat them fresh for shore lunch the next day they are fantastic."
4568265,adempsey,2016-02-21 14:18:00,963,"The cool things about those Hopkins Shorty (BPS Strata) spoons is you can slide a white tube jig over them. My local dollar store has a cheap knockoff of those spoons, so I bought some just for that reason. Offers a slightly different action and profile."
4579241,buckeye1,2016-02-24 17:32:00,269,Thanks for they tips. Can't wait to hook into a laker.
