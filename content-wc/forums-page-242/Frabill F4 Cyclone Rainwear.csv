No leaks anywhere on the suit. This rain gear is very well thought out, comfortable to wear and easy on and off. You pay a premium but you are getting a premium product. Two other buddies also own the same suits and complaints from either of them."
4585905,Mike Borger,2016-02-26 17:34:00,1554,Thanks!
4586601,Obabikon,2016-02-26 21:40:00,2370,"Interesting. Obviously, they put out an inferior product originally, and have lost a customer. The F3 is the first frabill rain suit I've ever owned... its probably half the weight of the cabelas... and quite a bit dryer (especially at the seams). I'm also out in it daily, and if it's raining... nightly (bailing boats). So, its very important to me to be dry, comfortable, and easy to move around in."
4587593,pete kraft,2016-02-27 10:18:00,28,"Mike, My brothers and I bought the F2 coat and bibs for our trip to Alaska last year. 18"" of rain in 6 days was a pretty good test. Stayed dry but in weather like that everything gets damp. We bought the lighter gear to be able to use them in warm weather. My only complaint is that they have neoprene cuffs that you can tighten up to avoid the drip down the arm thing.(nice feature) but they waterlogged. They would be perfect other than that. Does anyone have a recommendation on a waterproofing product that would remedy this problem ?Pete"
4587641,Mike Borger,2016-02-27 10:45:00,1554,Thanks Pete! Don't think there's a solution to waterproofing water logged neoprene though.
4587689,prov1800,2016-02-27 11:10:00,5010,After two attempts you get gun shy.my bass pro suit is also lighter and not as stiff as the cabelas suits.If i was to buy another suit i would buy another bass pro one since i have had such great service out of it for so many years.
4587889,Obabikon,2016-02-27 12:17:00,2370,"Seems like Plano just purchased Frabill a couple years ago... that probably will have a big swing in the service/quality. But, I'm like you... I go with what I like, and the people who have treated me right."
4583353,Mike Borger,2016-02-26 05:38:00,1554,I'm familiar with Frabill's earlier versions of their rainwear but not this one. Does anyone have first hand feedback on the F4 Cyclone jacket and bibs? They look pretty good but are pricey.http://www.frabill.com/apparel/open-...it-jacket.htmlhttp://www.frabill.com/apparel/open-...nsuit-bib.html
4583801,HTHM,2016-02-26 08:08:00,41,"Check the Ancaster CTC, they had Frabill Ice fishing suits on clearance. ~$ 150 for bibs and jacket. Mine works quite well, but is not waterproof. Not many left as I recall."
4583913,Mike Borger,2016-02-26 08:32:00,1554,"Not even close to being the same thing Albert. Nonetheless thanks, it's worth checking out!"
4584697,Obabikon,2016-02-26 10:53:00,2370,"Mike... I own two sets. Mine are the F3 though... they are amazing. The only difference between the F3 and the F4 is the breathable membrane. The F4 is 20,000 mm while the F3 is 15,000 mm. Basically... the F4 is a little heavier duty. By far... the best breathable raingear I've ever owned."
4584937,Mike Borger,2016-02-26 12:22:00,1554,"Well that sounds positive, thanks!"
4585161,prov1800,2016-02-26 13:23:00,5010,Have had a couple of frabill suits.both sucked.back to my older bass pro gear.old but great.also boyght some cabelas guide wear for back up.both suits are great.would never spend that kind of money on frabill again.
4585417,Knoxabilly,2016-02-26 14:32:00,225,Aren't you a Simms Guy Mike?
4585497,Mike Borger,2016-02-26 15:03:00,1554,"Yeah I have one of their rain suits, but I'm not sponsored by them.Just looking at options wondering if there's something better out there."
4585585,Obabikon,2016-02-26 15:31:00,2370,"Just interested... what frabill suit did you get? I had the cabelas guide wear, and it is crap compared to my F3."
4585785,prov1800,2016-02-26 16:33:00,5010,"The first ones they came out with.got litterallyvsoaked first i used it.they told me to sent it back ""cause they had a bad batch"" second suit was the same but it only lasted the summer.just went back to my 6 year old bass pro qualifier.i still use it today although i did buy csbelas guide wear on sale for 200 bucks and it totally dry.love it.iam out guiding everyday so i need good stuff.iam sure theres lots of rain gear stories.lol.i wear frogg toggs to and keep some in my boat for guests to wear in case hey dont have anything with them.there not even bad."
