4519881,Doc Northern,2016-02-05 19:19:00,4,Last year in mid to late June we spent a week on Lake of the Woods. The water was fairly clear and the crawfish were everywhere. The bottom of the lake was covered with them. The Smallmouth fishing was excellent and the big walleyes were in the shallows feeding on the crawfish. We have fished in the same area 4 or 5 times before and only saw an occasional crawfish. Did anyone else experience this? Does this happen every so many years like locusts? I sure hope so because the fishing was great.

4521201,Manitou,2016-02-06 10:13:00,125,Yeah there has been a change in the biology over the years.There were never as many when I was growing up.The little bay where I am used to have good weed patches but they are gone now.

4521977,Obabikon,2016-02-06 14:30:00,2370,"The North side of the lake is closer to large amounts of deep water. It is probably more likely to be ""clearer"" (still with the tea stain in it though). It could be a TINY TINY result of crayfish, but odds are, you just arrived at a time with small amounts of SW winds. The crayfish have affected the quantity of weed beds in some areas, but for the most part... they will not have the same affect as zebra muscles would (in making a lake clearer)"
4522185,fireboat,2016-02-06 16:44:00,752,First time we went to the LOW we stayed at Youngs Bay. The fish I cleaned the first day were all full of crawdads. The next 6 days we beat the rocky shore line with crawdad looking crank baits. We caught lots of walleye and SM every day. On the 3rd day I had several boats following me trying to figure out how we were bringing our limit back every day. Did the same thing on the Churchill river.

4593153,tsquared,2016-02-29 07:17:00,57,"We went to Lake of woods two years ago in Morson area which was my first time on the LOW. The crayfish were everywhere (and unfortunately we timed the mayfly hatch too). Having not been there before, could not say the effect on weedbeds, but others felt they were making an impact. I will say the crankbait bite was pretty good and everything would hit them - walleye, smallmouth, pike, occasional musky."
4593225,Ver88,2016-02-29 07:42:00,114,"The rusty crayfish have definitely reduced weed growth in the areas I fish on lake of the woods. From Sioux narrows to sunset channel there is very little weed growth in the areas I am familiar with. My group used to spend a lot of time fishing weed walleyes around cliff island and now those same areas are devoid of weeds all summer. When weeds were present we would find the walleyes in shallow weedy bays with perch and minnows present, now we find the walleyes in deeper water or in shallow water with a lot of crayfish present."
