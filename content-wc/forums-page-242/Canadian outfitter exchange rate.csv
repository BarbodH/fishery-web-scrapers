4571113,gonefishing13,2016-02-22 11:06:00,46,"I always use Hawk Air out of Wawa and they always charge us Canadian. However, their website only said they had ""fair exchange rates."" After I emailed them and asked for more details, they now post update the exchange rate they offer and update it daily on their page. Today the Exchange Rate is $1.34. Makes it easy to see if I should exchange money at the Casino when I cross, or just use their exchange rate."
4571137,Obabikon,2016-02-22 11:16:00,2370,"That is a VERY dirty move. Especially since they didn't adjust their pricing downwards to reflect the current exchange. They increased their pricing by 35% in one year... and didn't contact their guests when they did it. If they wanted to change it, they should have done that when the USD was tanked. Then it wouldn't have been a big deal."
4571169,Fisherman Ted,2016-02-22 11:26:00,461,"That gives all of us a bad name. Flip flopping rates is bad enough to begin with. Doing so without telling you, after you have already booked based on a certain price you were quote and not adjusting for the exchange rate is downright unethical. Find somewhere else. -FT"
4571185,Finshady,2016-02-22 11:40:00,12,"Quite simply they are increasing their rates by whatever the exchange currently is. This is a pure increase for both US and CND customers. Again, the increase is not the issue. They have the right to charge whatever rate they choose. The problem is holding a deposit, then increasing the rate. It works out to close to $100 CND increase per man."
4571289,pjshorthorn,2016-02-22 12:15:00,5654,Who is the outfitter? Not interested in using any outfitter that wants to play the ping ping game without any communication. It isn't like the exchange rate didn't favor US customers last year at lodges charging in loonies They had plenty of time to figure out what they wanted to do and communicate it to their current guest list. PjShorthorn. .
4571305,v-bay gord,2016-02-22 12:19:00,3168,"Well, on the flip side, by leaving your deposit to carry over to the next year I don't think that should lock in the old rate. The business has a right to increase the rate. The deposit just guarantees you a cabin for the week you asked for. You have the ability to have your deposit returned to you, so you are not being held hostage. Was it a poor move on the resort's part...yes......they might have had a strategy in place to ease the old guests onto the new rate structure..."
4569241,Andre (wallyandre),2016-02-21 18:55:00,2274,Still waiting for some names of the ones that are not discounting!
4569345,Obabikon,2016-02-21 19:18:00,2370,I'm not sure... most resorts that charge in USD held prices steady. I think he was suggesting they actually lower prices.
4570129,Shellback,2016-02-22 06:56:00,8083,"I'm definitely shopping lodges that charge in CA dollars this year. I wasn't able to retire at 62 and enjoy 5 or 6 fishing trips a year by leaving 25% + on the table, by not shopping smart all my life. The exchange rate has been fairly close the past 6 years, So I imagine folks haven't been too fussy about the currency lodges charged. If this higher discrepancy keeps up, I imagine lodges will have to adjust rates bringing CA and US dollar costs closer. Whether CA $ lodges increase their rates or US $ lodges lower theirs, time will tell. I had to chuckle last year at the lodge I went to. They charged in US $ for everything, including stuff in the store. But gave you change in CA $. There was about a 20% difference at the time. First year there, and last year there."
4570201,Obabikon,2016-02-22 07:27:00,2370,"Actually... the last 6 years, people should have been finding lodges that charged in USD's. Anything under the average $1.27 should favor USD's... anything over $1.27 should favor Canadian dollars."
4570329,Shellback,2016-02-22 08:07:00,8083,"Not sure how the $1.27 figures in. I only remember 1 year in the past 6 where the CA dollar was higher, that was only a penny or two. I tend to use a credit card when possible because I get the exchange rate that day with either 1% or no fee at all. Now having businesses or banks doing the exchange is different. They always like to beat you up. I always exchange cash with my Canadian friend. That way neither of us gets beat up. I don't pay an exchange rate getting CA dollars, and he doesn't pay an exchange rate getting US dollars. He's close to the border and often shopped or traveled in the US. Well he did, not so much now with the exchange rate. Canadians are sure getting beat up now with imports or US travel."

It is usually an inside joke amongst Canadians about the value of our loonie against the US...tons of Cdn self deprecating jokes about it...the way we are wired I guess. One of the drawbacks of a strong Cdn dollar in recent years we have been robbed of telling those jokes...no more though!"
4570465,Obabikon,2016-02-22 08:43:00,2370,"The past 6 years have been the worst exchange rates over the past 30 years for anyone charging in USD's. Kind of hard to expect the middle of a recession to be the ""norm"". $1.27 is the average over the past 30. That's where it should be expected to settle around (eventually). That should be where most businesses plan the exchange rate to be... long term anyways."
4570881,Finshady,2016-02-22 10:02:00,12,"I find this thread really interesting. We are CND in a situation where the camp we have gone to for the last 4 years has charged us in CND and posted as such on their website. We carried over our deposit again for this Sept as we have done in past years. Now they are charging us the same value but in US. The only reason I found this out is because I noticed they changed it on their website. I contacted them with my concern and was basically told that they will do nothing about it. We don't want to cancel our trip and ask for our deposit back but feel this is a very poor business decision. I can understand their option to modify their pricing structure but feel it is a dirty move to make that change after a deposit has been made and even worse, not even tell us about it. We will obviously be looking at our options for next year."
4570921,v-bay gord,2016-02-22 10:14:00,3168,"That is a sad commentary on greed, and a total disrespect for a loyal customer. It is a dirty move......... Perhaps they are just trying to make it easier to understand for their U.S. guests......Ha!"
4570929,LOW1,2016-02-22 10:17:00,2828,"What does ""same value"" mean - the same number of US$ as they charged you in $Cdn last year? Or the same ""value"" based on the current exchange rate? What did the amount they charged you last year in $Cnd work out to in $US? What are they charging you in $US this year compared to the value in $US of what you paid last year in $Cdn? ? What sort of exchange rate did they give you on the $Cnd deposit that you had? I would be curious to see as much of an apple-apple comparison as possible. Maybe they are actually giving you a lower cost.I do agree with you that the resort dropped the ball in not informing you."
4564649,dar100,2016-02-20 09:56:00,7,"ted did not think about food, as we bring our own. not trying to deny anyone from making a living but if rates keep going up every year we go and now they are making 30% on exchange rate I think outfitter should at least hold prices"
4564689,Fisherman Ted,2016-02-20 10:00:00,461,Here's another cost most people don't think about. Electric (Hydro). Ontario has the highest Hydro costs than anywhere in North America! My bill is sometimes as high as my mortgage.
4565017,bthomas3333,2016-02-20 11:26:00,465,Hand to head....Don't Reply Don't Reply Don't Reply...**** it can't help myself.When a lodge charges in USD they are taking on the currency risk since their larger costs (Labour / Mortgage / Food / Util) are charged in CAD. They take on this risk and whether the exchange rate moves against them or for them they own the risk. As a US customer I like that. I don't like to be surprised what my vacation will cost. If they charged in CAD my USD might buy me more or less vacation.Now recently the exchange rate has moved in the favor of the lodge owners. Guess what they might be lucky right now and make an extra 10-20%. I would bet maybe of the owners who have held back on improvements might have some $ to plow back into new water systems / boats / roofs / or save for a rainy day. If the rate goes back to par they will be getting hurt again. Not my problem...The best part is as a US customer I DONT CARE if a guy makes a little more based on taking a risk. I took a risk and started a business. So far it has worked out but they risk could've also lost me everything. When you take a risk you should own the upside or why take a risk.Anyway...If you think you are being gouged by your camp then shop around. Find an option you like better and go with it. Otherwise enjoy your vacation at the rate you were quoted and not worry about whether the owner has a 15% margin or 25% margin.My two cents. Hand returning to my head...B-

4566081,v-bay gord,2016-02-20 19:52:00,3168,I will continue to charge in Canadian $ because I operate in Canada and I'm a Canadian. I charge what I need to operate.......I'm not interested in speculating on the $.

4566361,roscoe33,2016-02-20 22:14:00,653,oops delete
4566729,youngknight,2016-02-21 07:15:00,228,"I believe in outfitter choice to charge how and what rates they choose....free marketplace. Having said that it is a pet peeve that a business in Canada that is entirely based on a Canadian resource operates as it is in the U.S?a....especially American owners....again, free marketplace but as a Canadian I feel entitled to at least have an opinion. But I have noticed that Quebec outfitters generally charge in Canadian as does a higher percentage of NE Ontario.....no doubt reflective of the customer base. I have noticed that not much change in prices from last year to this year...Cdn charged or USA charged. So that $1000 trip in Cdn this year costs about the same. $1000 U.S. Cost maybe $1100 Cdn last year....this year $1450. So if I was happy with the place and money no object then simply pay the extra $350. But for many of us money is an object. Normally I go with my teenage son who is too old for many camps to get a kid discount so paying for 2ppl...now $700 more...so, I am out. But as I said, choice of outfitter...but my choice to decide that exchange rate causes my price to increase too much. The exchange rate will impact many of us Cdn anglers in gear purchase as we can directly or indirectly expect higher costs on gear. I bought a trolling motor two years ago...started saving for an itroll...now it has gone up $200 for me. I know, not a direct item for the op topic."
4566737,Obabikon,2016-02-21 07:23:00,2370,I figured an average exchange rate over the past 30 years. (basically added the yearly averages and divided by 30) The average exchange rate has been around 1.27 Canadian per USD Very interesting. As stated previously... many mortgages (including mine) are actually in USD's. So that's an enormous expense.
4563401,dar100,2016-02-19 18:42:00,7,"with rate 70 cent to US dollar , most outfitters are quoting in US dollars, and not discounting their rates to adjust for slumping canadian dollar, the quebec outfitter we go to has same rates as last year any thoughts"
4563593,Obabikon,2016-02-19 20:07:00,2370,"LOL! This topic has been discussed a lot. It shouldn't be an issue unless lodges charged ""surcharges"" on years that the exchange rate dropped. Then, I feel they would owe a discount on rates where it went up."
4563721,prov1800,2016-02-19 21:18:00,5010,"Rates at 99% of camps has always been in us funds.The only place you will benefit from the exchange will be food, gas and BEER."

4563833,roscoe33,2016-02-19 22:57:00,653,"Most fly-in and higher end resorts seem to be using US $. But many drive-in housekeeping cabins in the lower price ranges are quoted in C $. I went through over 50 brochures and websites this month, and found about half of the cabins in the $300-600 per person price range, are quoted in C $. Even found a few that were in C $ and NOT priced per person. No mention of surcharges yet, but some did specify ""new 2016 rates""."

That said, I have contacted a few Outfitters over the past couple of days, some will give you a break, one said he would charge par, others give you the song and dance. I have seen some Outfitters who have changed their rates to US after always being in CDN, that is short term gain, long term pain for retaining CDN customers over the long haul. This industry is a struggle for many, any opportunity to grab windfall profit seems to be the strategy at the moment, lets see who survives. We are going back to Leuenbergers, always has charged CDN, has not put up prices in at least 4 years, has been around since 1960!"

4564305,Fisherman Ted,2016-02-20 07:47:00,461,"Not to burst your bubble but gas/propane are nowhere near our biggest costs. Try food. And food has skyrocketed over the past few years and continues to do so, especially because of the drought in the US. Food has at least doubled in nearly every category in the past 7 years from my experience. Insurance is also a top money suck and of course the number one cost is labor. Sure gas has gone down a little (but not that much). Actually in the summer it jacks right back up looking at my books. The savings are nominal. All of our major costs are going right up each year, some significantly.... -FT"
