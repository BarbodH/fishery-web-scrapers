But the 'dream bubble' over my head is always popped by the thought of getting to/from the lake on my own. Then I came across this:http://iconaircraft.com/ Certainly not cheap, but pretty darn cool! I wonder how much the flight cost per hour compares to a Beaver? Only holds two people and about 600 pounds of gear..."

4583449,Skywagon,2016-02-26 06:18:00,1106,"You need to look a little closer look at the specs ""Useful Load: 430-550 lbs (195-249 kg)"", useful load is a combination of passengers and fuel. Providing you and your passenger are normal size people, you would be able to fly yourselves, fishing pole and tooth brush in legally. I know someone that has put a deposit on one of these, it will used as a toy, just something to be played with, not a load hauler, but they are neat."
4583505,Shellback,2016-02-26 06:37:00,8083,Probably about 20 years ago my company was doing some work at a local airport. At that time there was a fellow developing an aircraft very similar to that one. I'd be curious to know if this aircraft came about due to his work. He did have a flying aircraft.
4583593,bthomas3333,2016-02-26 07:15:00,465,"I was surprised the range was 400+ nm. That is a pretty good distance for a small aircraft. Of course after being locked in that small of space for 4 hours you'd probably be ready for a break. I was wondering what ""useful load"" meant. If that is passengers + gear. Unless you fly along there is no room for gear. **** most guys tackle boxes weigh 40-50 lbs.B-"
4585865,BrianE,2016-02-26 17:22:00,98,Wow way cool thanks!
4585945,bassnblast,2016-02-26 17:46:00,56,Oops! Must have misread that. Guess I'd have to leave the wife at home...
