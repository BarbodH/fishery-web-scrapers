4594153,forgop,2016-02-29 13:07:00,880,"Saw on another thread when searching Viking that someone else had a medical emergency, they were at the dock in less than an hour, took out the evacuee and a buddy, and brought buddy back next day after things were good with him at hospital...all at no charge. Few outfitters will rise to that level of service without a big fee involved and rightfully so as these planes cost potentially hundreds of dollars to operate per hour (unless they own their own planes). As i said, it may not be in the cards this year as I'd already decided on a destination, but they're my choice for next year. It's probably a big reason why it would be a good idea to stick with outfitters that operate their own aircraft vs those who sub out that portion of the trip to someone else. That said, running out of beer, bourbon, etc...ok, but a special trip for gin? Heck no."
4547545,Mully,2016-02-15 08:03:00,145,"Looking for info on Viking Outposts out of Red Lake. Primarily looking at Rheaume Lake or Orono Lake. We wouldn't be going until late June, early July. Heard and seen great videos of early fishing (early June) for nice pike and walleye, was wondering how fishing was later in the year. Primarily looking for Pike and Walleye, not huge bodies of water, and portage lake availability. Viking looks like it meets most or our criteria. Also, any comments on cabins, boats motors, service?. Never been on fly-in and wanted to check it off the bucket list. Thanks"
4548425,bthomas3333,2016-02-15 12:02:00,465,Hey - I can't speak to the specific lakes in question. I have fished with Viking more than a dozen times over the last 20+ years. They run a quality outpost experience. The cabins have always been clean / neat / very functional. The boats and motors are about average. The fishing has been very good. They do a very good job of getting folks in and out of camp on time and always do their check flights.In general they run a quality operation.Brett
4578257,hoffy,2016-02-24 13:04:00,6,have been to Orono a couple of times and am going this year on July 15. Great fishing lake and first class operation. Have not been to Rheaume
4584313,forgop,2016-02-26 09:51:00,880,"I met Craig and Roseanne at the Indy show yesterday. Most likely won't happen this year, but will likely try for Dolphin or Critchell next year. They offer a lot of services you won't find elsewhere, especially for the price. It'd be nice to have them shop for all my food/drinks and have it ready to go when I arrive to save all the space when packing and not have to shop/pack when I arrive either."
4587249,Mully,2016-02-27 08:11:00,145,"So many options out there but talked to owners and satisfied customers. Having them provide some/all of the food is a nice option. I have trouble packing for a weekend trip, packing food, supplies, etc. and having a weight restriction seems challenging. They also do 2 safety checks and would provide supplies at no additional cost (except for the supplies) is a nice perk. The lakes also fit the criteria we are looking for, size of the lake, fishery, portage potential , etc. Thanks for the feedback. Keep it coming."
4587545,pete kraft,2016-02-27 10:05:00,28,"My son and I did a trip to Critchell with them. Lot's of water, 4 or 5 lakes to fish. They are really good outfitters"
4587601,forgop,2016-02-27 10:22:00,880,"That's one of the thing that appeals to me when looking at lake options. I realizes most of the outpost lakes aren't pressured by any means, but like the idea of exploring waters that are barely touched. It's also nice to see a lot of the scenery you'd miss out on by not trying. Critchell looks to provide a lot of options. One reason I'm picking the lake I want for 2016 is to fish a lake the outfitter said hasn't seen a lure in over 20 years."
4587609,pete kraft,2016-02-27 10:25:00,28,"forgop, pm if you want more info on Critchell"
4587649,forgop,2016-02-27 10:49:00,880,Thanks Dolphin is another I'm looking at and what they said is probably their best walleye numbers lake. Critchell appears to have so many points and narrows with all of the portage areas included. What time of year did you fish it?
4593489,phishfearme,2016-02-29 08:44:00,1242,"we did a two week trip with Viking to their Telescope Lake outpost - on the second ""safety check"", we mentioned to Hugh that we were out of Gin and that we guess it will have to stay that way until we fly out in a few days. Not for Hugh!! later that day we saw a plane land and take off shortly thereafter. when we returned to the cabin, there was a fresh bottle of gin on the table. Now THAT'S a good outfitter!! periodic ""safety checks"" can also become emergency ""medical"" runs too. phish"
