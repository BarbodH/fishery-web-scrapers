6659698,Eckohlt,2022-05-28 10:57:00,3685,"Exactly!!!could market that I think,put tarter on one half n steak sauce on the other half."
6659812,Prolinerob,2022-05-28 20:57:00,1,"Melt 1/4 pound of butter, then mix in breadcrumbs until butter is soaked up. Spoon it on fillets and put in oven 400degrees for 10min. Its a great alternative to frying in oil, can turn on broiler for a few seconds to crisp up the breadcrumbs more if you like the crunch. Try it, you'll like it!"
6658658,Hammer Tyme,2022-05-23 20:31:00,293,"Ran out of oil so we made due with leftover bacon fat from baking the bacon in the oven we use occasionally. We were surprised that there wasn't a heavy bacon/smoked flavor, really no taste to speak of. I guess in a sense it is a type of lard.As we get older we seem to want to reuse and waste less."
6658660,SweetD,2022-05-23 20:37:00,243,"I have seen a few fish coatings mentioned. We discovered Kentucky Kernel Seasoned Flour a few years ago and I think it is my favorite by far. No a big fan of the grainy corn meal stuff but to each their own. Saltines/Flour and Ruffles potato chips crushed finely is also a tremendous fish coating too…..just add salt and pepper. Happy fryin, baking, grilling fellas!!!!Appreciate all the feedback here."

6659446,Eckohlt,2022-05-26 16:39:00,3685,"With all the people on here using different coatings on fish,it goes to show almost anything works on Canadian fish,it's fun to try different coatings for sure."
6659448,prov1800,2022-05-26 17:11:00,5010,Your right Eck.Its all good.
6659624,drlee,2022-05-27 19:44:00,409,Still go with peanut oil. Various breading is fun.
6659648,last chance,2022-05-28 04:58:00,3262,I just like it the old-fashioned way dip in egg and milk and coat in flour and cornmeal mix and fry in lard. I have tried almost al;l of the oils but after new studies said lard wasn't as bad as once thought I went back to lard for the better flavor.
6659660,Timmer92,2022-05-28 06:05:00,451,"We make our own oil blend and strain and reuse it. We add juices and grease from cooking meat - bacon, sausage, pork chops, steak, etc."
6659670,walleyecheek,2022-05-28 07:45:00,2231,Do the walleye fillets taste like beef or pork ?
6659690,Eckohlt,2022-05-28 10:42:00,3685,If it does taste like beef or pork then that's your surf n turf all in a fillet.
6658330,maddogg,2022-05-22 10:37:00,178,I use it every 5 years when my Dr prescribes it.I don't care for it at all. I wouldn't recommend it if your planning on fishing that day.
6658578,FrankLeigh,2022-05-23 15:22:00,80,Prep is/was a commercial edible oil formerly made by Procter and Gamble. P & G sold their edible oils division about 25 or 30 years ago to Canamera Foods. I don't know who makes it now. I knew some guys who used it back when and swore by it. Never tried it myself. FrankLeigh
6658602,prov1800,2022-05-23 18:01:00,5010,If anyone is all concerned about using oil or lard for health reason then just bake it or bbq it on one of cooking sheets.Its all good.

6658624,Eckohlt,2022-05-23 18:30:00,3685,"[QUOTE=prov1800;6658622]Ok thanks,need some warm weather n dry weather to really turn them on,that won't happen until June 13."
6658628,prov1800,2022-05-23 18:50:00,5010,The west side by hwy 105 has the coldest water in the lake.To get to the good fishing you have to take ĺong boat ride to get to right areas.If we had done that we would of have been looking at catching 2-300 walleye with 4 of us.Water temps there with warm water creeks flowing in is unreal.Main lake spots take till July to turn on.
6658636,Eckohlt,2022-05-23 19:10:00,3685,"A bigger boat n more horse power would have put you in walleye heaven I assume,is that correct?im starting to sound like a lawyer now."
6658642,drlee,2022-05-23 19:36:00,409,"We deep fry our fish in peanut oil, always, no substitutes. Can heat to high level. Fish just plain ""flash fry."" Put the fillets on paper towel covered plate, no oil spots. Yes, its still fried food. Only fry for 3 or 4 minutes. Let oil heat up between batches of fish. Chunked up are easier to deal with than full fillets. Peanut oil has no real flavor. We like Shore Lunch brand corn meal, cajun, buffalo, and regular. Not wild about heavier batter. We mix in black en'd on a Black Stone. Bon Apetite!"
6658656,jrock,2022-05-23 20:26:00,26,Canola Oil for deep frying & Olive or Avacado oil when Pan Searing. I've moved way south and this is how I am cooking now and it is great. I prefer Pan Searing & grilling with Snapper/Grouper & frying for the kids.
6658110,Eckohlt,2022-05-21 15:11:00,3685,So about 2 minutes per side for a 32 incher.haha
6658114,Eckohlt,2022-05-21 15:16:00,3685,If I got on a bike now I probably have to get my hockey gear on just to be on the safe side.
6658118,prov1800,2022-05-21 15:18:00,5010,No kidding.
6658122,Eckohlt,2022-05-21 15:46:00,3685,"John won't be coming your way till december,water should be done running by then."
6658134,lassh,2022-05-21 17:29:00,553,"Best oil for deep frying is peanut oil. It resists burning more than others so it will last longer if you don't overheat it. Throw a few sliced potatoes in every one in a while to absorb the particulates and clean up the oil. If we're pan frying, usually just use olive oil or olive oil and butter."
6658182,adempsey2.0,2022-05-21 20:46:00,611,"I am of the belief that the ""health"" concerns were purely marketing propaganda to sell more margarine and shortening. Nothing wrong with lard and it is actually probably healthier.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0htZ7ocCk-Q"
6658184,adempsey2.0,2022-05-21 20:50:00,611,Anyone ever use Prep?I was at a camp and these guys swore by this Prep stuff. Never heard of it before then.
6658198,last chance,2022-05-22 04:08:00,3262,"I read someplace they are backtracking on health issues with lard. they say it doesn't clog arteries as bad as other types of shortening after doing more research. we switched to oil for cooking then after a while we went back to lard for cooking fish. but now after hearing lard isn't so unhealthy after all we are starting to use lard for other things like pinto beans, fried green tomatoes, and some other stuff."
6658234,Eckohlt,2022-05-22 06:10:00,3685,Gonna have to research that prep stuff.
6658268,Bill Krejca,2022-05-22 07:12:00,6107,"Dad used to use lard for frying fish. I got away from it due to the constantly voiced health concerns, seems if you wait long enough, so many of the ""truths"" become overturned. Bill"
6658056,SweetD,2022-05-21 13:15:00,243,Curious what everyone’s preferences are and why? We have tried most and not sure I have a particular lean. Canola oil doesn’t tend to smoke as much as some but really don’t recall having too many issues with any oil we have used. I personally like to fry my fillets in a skillet with oil and a good pad of real butter.Others????
6658058,Eckohlt,2022-05-21 13:23:00,3685,"I like to use the same stuff they use in nascars it handles the heat well,just kidding sweet,I seem to always take up veggie oil never had a problem with it.your last sentence is a great easy way."
6658068,prov1800,2022-05-21 14:05:00,5010,There's nothing that beats lard.Dònt want to hear health issues.lol.
6658072,Eckohlt,2022-05-21 14:17:00,3685,"Well can't say I've ever fried with lard but I have heard the word lard used a few times in a sentence,such as HEY lard arse come here.lol"

6658090,RichA$1970,2022-05-21 14:38:00,1159,Lard doesn’t smell up the place as bad. I use canola but the real trick is to use 2/3 corn starch and 1/3 baking powder as your batter mix and then season how you want it. I learned this from street food vendors in SE Asia as they all do it as it makes the fish super crispy like Bon Chon.
6658092,Cgillespie,2022-05-21 14:42:00,120,"Peanut oil for deep frying, olive oil and butter when cooking on the Blackstone."
6658102,Eckohlt,2022-05-21 14:49:00,3685,Always nice to here a crunch when wolfing down eyes.

6658108,prov1800,2022-05-21 15:06:00,5010,"If you like crunch just let fillets go longer and they'll drive up inside.. I personally like them flaky and moist and that means about a minute per side for a 16"" er in 375 f."
