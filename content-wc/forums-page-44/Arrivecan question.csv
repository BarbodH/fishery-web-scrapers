I know that you cannot submit the information no earlier than 72 hours prior to crossing the border and have a question or two from some of you that elected this process rather than downloading the app on your phone. Have any of you had any issues at the border with the PDF? My concern is the legibility of the passport which I had to make a copy of to make it work in my scanner and the passport has a darker background. Would also doing on the phone with a picture be better in addition to the PDF or would that make things more confusing for them? Just concerned that when I arrive at the border they tell me they cannot read the passport or can they just verify that when I hand them the physical passport. Thank you, John"

I may be missing something but I would suggest not trying to get creative and just take pics of actual docs required by the App when prompted to do so. Take physical “official” vaccine status paperwork from your doctor or clinic where you were vaccinated. Tell the clinic or your doctor and they will provide. Anything that is in the App you should have a hard copy of that you can show if for some reason the App were not to display. I also took screenshots of everything in the App so I could show pics if phone service didn’t work at border. I slso took pictures of every hard copy document I took so I had that in my phone photo library as well.Good Luck
