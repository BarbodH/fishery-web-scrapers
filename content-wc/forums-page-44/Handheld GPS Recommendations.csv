6660236,Mojo-NC,2022-05-30 14:02:00,1929,"I bought a Garmin handheld several years ago. I never really used it. I seldom hike where I don't know where I am and both my vehicle and my boat already have GPS. I may as well have thrown $250 into my glove box and left it there. I'm not trying to discourage you from getting one, just pointing out that they are not for everyone."
6660310,MikeAnkeny,2022-05-30 19:06:00,67,For about $15 I have Navionics on my smart phone with my favorite routes and fishing spots. Gets me through Shanty Narrows without leaving the lower unit behind.
6660486,adempsey2.0,2022-05-31 09:04:00,611,"Still using my Garmin eTrex as well. While I understand using a smartphone is handy, I just hate using my phone as a GPS. The battery life on the handheld GPS is amazing. Two AA last a few days being on for 14+ hours each day. My phone could never do that. Of course, with a battery pack it would probably be fine. Also, I like that I can add waypoints onto my handheld using my computer. Not sure I can do that with a phone, but never tried it. I also find holding my phone with one hand uncomfortable. I suppose a good Otter (or similar) case may help with that though. I do want to upgrade to a newer model with a touch screen, but have not done so yet. Just making a case for using a handheld GPS over a smartphone. Of course, having both is not a bad idea either since you already have the phone."
6660602,MikeAnkeny,2022-05-31 13:19:00,67,BTW - I don't trust the suggested routes from Navionics.
6660606,prov1800,2022-05-31 13:30:00,5010,I have a brownish line on my naviocs chip.The save route.i guide out of Earfalls at times and that route on my chip is save.When I guide out of Onaway Lodge and head toward McKenzie or go through poplar narrows to head toward indigo point I pick tgat line up again and it keeps heading toward Sioux lookout as I've seen the line come back as I've come out of Williams bay.Have also seen the ĺine goung to Chamberlain narrows.Its a great route.it takes you around some places that I go through but stick to it and your good to go.
6660610,N_of_Quibell,2022-05-31 13:55:00,151,Great suggestion! I have Avenza on my cheapo Walmart Samsung Tab A. Works like a charm.
6660658,valley366,2022-05-31 16:57:00,193,I have an older Garmin. Even though have other methods of navigation (phone/tablet) for the lakes up there I still use the Garmin a ton. Have it hanging from my life jacket and hit the mark button whenever we catch a fish on a new spot. Since it is weatherproof i feel comfortable having that out compared to my phone. Once I have the spot marked I lay it on the console in front of me and reference the WP to backtroll back to the fish. On some of the small fishing spots you will be amazed at how much help it is.
6660112,Ronr81!,2022-05-30 07:42:00,15,I’m going to Lac Seul late June. I have some pretty good maps but I also want to purchase a handheld GPS. Any recommendations ?
6660116,prov1800,2022-05-30 07:49:00,5010,I've had a Garmin expedition a few years now.awesome unit and great mapping as well as texting.It Bluetooth to my phone so I see the map bigger.Never leave home without.Shows same mapping as navionics
6660120,Timmer92,2022-05-30 08:01:00,451,"I have had a Garmin eTrex that I have used for hunting for over 10 years. That timeframe almost certainly makes it ""old"" by technology standards. They are still producing the product line but I have found no reason to upgrade. They are many generations ahead of what I have. For what I do it has everything I need - waterproof, topology and elevation, compass, custom waypoints with numerous symbol choices, routes/routing, state and federal parks and forests, sunrise/sunset/hunt/fish/moon calendar."
6660124,prov1800,2022-05-30 08:06:00,5010,I upgraded to the expedition for the texting capabilities as I take guests off the grid and for fly in moose hunts.
6660128,'Taterguy,2022-05-30 08:10:00,33,"https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/623975 This is the one I'm looking at. I was going to purchase the InReach Mini-2 for the satellite texting and SOS functions. Mainly for the 502 and at the outpost. Then I saw the one linked above and remembered my eTrex was over 20 years old and no longer supported so I changed gears. Cabela's has the the one linked above and the mini-2. If they have the 10% off Tuesday tomorrow I'll be ordering it. (POINTS!) The sticky part is the satellite plan. I've done lots of looking at the plans but still not sure how the 30 days work. Can I use it for a week, shut down the txt plan, turn it back on for a week, and repeat until the 30 days are used up or is it 30 days contiguous? Why txt at the outpost? Isn't that why we go to an outpost to get away from all that? Yup. What my wife may not know is I think I can set how often the machine checks for txt messages. It might accidentally get set to check once a week."
6660134,elway12,2022-05-30 09:02:00,335,"I have the Garmin GPS64st. It is a solid all around unit. There are different models of it which include texting, Bluetooth etc. if that is what your are needing. It has a good satellite response and fairly easy to use."
6660138,prov1800,2022-05-30 09:20:00,5010,I upgraded in case of emergencies or break downs.i travell our of cell range often.I barely use it but comes along both on fishing trips/fly in fishing and hunting.12 bucks a month in Canada for 10 text mssg a month.except for some moose trips getting a plane in to take moose out about all ice ever used it for.BUT it's there if I ever need it.
6660142,treegrower,2022-05-30 09:29:00,5,If you want something for free or very inexpensive you can load Avenza on your phone and download topomaps on to it. They are georefernenced and can track and set waypoints. You don’t need cell coverage just gps turned on.
6660150,SterlingArcher,2022-05-30 10:16:00,92,"I've been using an ancient Lowrance H20c for 15+ years. Knowing that it will stop working at some point, I did a double upgrade: I bought a Garmin Striker 5cv sonar unit that has GPS, can do live mapping of lake contours, and is a massive upgrade over the cheapie Lowrance graph I've used for 20 years. I bought a suction cup mount for the transducer to stick it onto the transom of the boat. Not a handheld unit but it's a win on multiple fronts and it's very portable."
6660212,Ronr81!,2022-05-30 12:59:00,15,Great suggestions thank you all!
