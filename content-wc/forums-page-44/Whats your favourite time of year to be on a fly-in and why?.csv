6658954,SweetD,2022-05-24 20:17:00,243,Never been mid-July but avg temps in upper 70’s sound absolutely perfect! I have had Snow and blazing hot in late May. Bugs are generally not bad. Mid June trips I have had have been horrific for mosquitoes and black flies. I will take the avg temps in mid July with schools of Walleye stacked like cordwood in their deep water holes!!!50’ish days to go
6658956,adempsey2.0,2022-05-24 20:21:00,611,"Mid-June and Mid-September. If I happen to be heading pretty far north, then the summer months are not so bad either."
6658988,vteye3,2022-05-25 05:19:00,496,Enough said
6658990,Eckohlt,2022-05-25 05:56:00,3685,Anytime of the year and at sunrise.
6659054,NM_Trout,2022-05-25 08:41:00,1094,"I've gone mostly early season, from very late May through mid June. I love that time of year, but the weather can be nasty. We always get way more rain than we would like. Went early July once, and had less rain, but way more heat. Its all good :-)"
6659058,Net_Man,2022-05-25 08:51:00,580,"Well, I prefer cold over heat, no mosquitos and I generally desire scheduling on the opener. There is just a extra bonus fishing for fish that have not been molested for several months. But for me it still boils down is quality walleye fishing so timing is also lake dependent. There are some specific fly-in lakes that I prefer to fish in the summer over the spring."
6659106,Camoclad,2022-05-25 11:21:00,628,"Truthfully, I will take a fly-in anytime I can go! If I get to pick, I really like the second week of the season, toward the end of May."
6659240,LoDo,2022-05-25 18:41:00,721,BINGO!!! Love early / mid June and all of Sept.
6659380,Mojo-NC,2022-05-26 10:27:00,1929,"Depending on the year, we've gone up either opening day through the first full week in June, or in early-mid September. During the early season (May/June) weather-wise we've experienced all 4 seasons in a single week, from sleet and snow one year to 90 degrees during another. Early-mid September wasn't that much different, but overall it wasn't nearly as cold and we had a couple days of 90 degree weather then too. In the spring the fish are much more shallow (8-15'); therefore, walleyes are a bit easier to catch. In September it was a little more difficult because most of the fish we caught were in about 25' of water or deeper. I still think I prefer September. One year our camp owners allowed us to stay a few extra days at no additional expense because we were the last group of the season. That was awesome!"
6659514,djglover7,2022-05-27 09:41:00,54,"Mid to late Sep.- Lots of fish- No bugs- Mix of temperatures- A little freeze, snow, and sleet to keep things interesting."
6658788,acplumber,2022-05-24 10:29:00,80,We usually aim to fishing right around the first day of summer. Bugs arent great but the fishing is usually spectacular! And its cool to have day light until midnight and then it come back out at 5am-ish. In 2014 we booked the opener and couldn’t get into our camp so had to scramble to find one with an open lake. That year the walleye and pike fishing was slow but the lake trout fishing made up for it. This year will be trip #3 for that timeline for us.
6658808,SweetD,2022-05-24 11:46:00,243,"Mid July this year for us. First time mid Summer but really looking forward to it. Have generally been early (late May). Went in early September last Fall. I don’t think there is truly a bad time of year to be out on a Shield lake! Weather is probably the only x factor in having a good vs great trip. I hope to one day be making a May, July and September trip each year! Never gets old!!!!"
6658810,jveri,2022-05-24 11:58:00,70,We usually go end of june and are up on the lake between june 26 to july 4. This year we are going a week earlier and too a different lake. Hoping the bugs and weather play nice as we've always had decent weather end of june.
6658814,stumcfar,2022-05-24 12:01:00,451,The only thing I can say about mid-summer is it can be so blamed hot and there is no way to cool down at night. Typically the black flies are out too. I would prefer an early June trip if openings can be found.
6658822,Walleye2242,2022-05-24 12:29:00,263,Mid Sept. Cool days and cool nights. NO bugs. Fall color scenery. Best time in my opinion.
6658826,SterlingArcher,2022-05-24 12:37:00,92,"I've gone in late June, mid July and early August. Every time has its pros and cons. Earlier in the year usually means better lake trout fishing but worse pike fishing. July usually means at least a couple days will be roasting hot weather but that's when we've done best for big walleyes. Any time of year is a great time to be up there!"
6658830,Ryan Coke,2022-05-24 13:06:00,9,"Sioux Lookout Fly in. Late August / Early September. NO Bugs. Great weather. Mid day July / August thunder storms have moved off. Though the fish are deeper, fishing is still spectacular. Fish was fattening up for the winter. Not the skinny ""Yoga Mom"" fish I caught in June.Used to fish the coveted June dates, I much prefer the fall fishing now."
6658904,Old Timer,2022-05-24 17:19:00,255,"For me, it kinda depends on the lake. It would be between June 20th and July 1st at one of my favorite lakes in years past. Sure, the bugs can be bad and so can the heat and/or cold. But it's that window on that lake when we almost always caught 30 fish. But if I had to pick just one window of time to fish Ontario it would be around the third week of September. Why? Well, great fall colors and great fishing. And you have the roads and lakes all to yourself. Advance reservations are seldom necessary. Just check the weather, make the call and then go. Yes, the weather can be dicey, but you check ahead before you call. And regardless, pack warm clothes because you never know. Also, forget the leeches and crawlers. Just buy big chubs at your favorite bait store. Those and 1/4 oz jigs are all you need."
6658926,Eckohlt,2022-05-24 17:52:00,3685,"I use crawlers late sept n first week Oct they hammer them,buy big chubs in Ontario you'll go broke.I also like 4 to 6 inch salted suckers,but there banned now so crawlers are the ones,and they love'm even late fall."
6658936,RichA$1970,2022-05-24 18:50:00,1159,Early June is my top pick followed by mid September. I’ve done a couple of August trips and it was F N hot all day so no thanks.
