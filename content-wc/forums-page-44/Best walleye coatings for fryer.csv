6659418,bus33,2022-05-26 13:34:00,289,Tried the Fleet Farm Back 40 mix last year....I really like it. It's a wet / dry mix.
6659422,valley366,2022-05-26 13:51:00,193,I have tried several varieties and always come back to my dad's recipe.Beat an egg and had milk until light yellow. Mix 50/50 flour and corn flake crumbs. I tend to go slightly heavy on flour like a heaping 1/3 cup and 1/3 cup corn flake crumbs.Dredge in milk then throw in zip lock with dry mix. Shake until evenly coated.Throw them in the oil and come out great every time.

6659524,proguidedream,2022-05-27 10:26:00,345,"great suggestions here , pretty much any flour/starch based coating can be made in to a beer batter or wet batter. Its the ones that are bread crumb based that just need a good egg wash to stick , also the most chrunchy"
6659616,drlee,2022-05-27 19:37:00,409,"After many years and many options for fried walleye, I have to go with Shore Lunch regular, corn meal, cajun, and a newer version, buffalo. Sometimes hard to find but has become a favorite. Bottom Line: Use Peanut Oil."
6659652,Riding high,2022-05-28 05:26:00,69,Yeap. I dip in milk than catch and cook than egg wash than panko bread crumbs for the crunchy fish and the grandkids love it. We use canola oil so you don't have to worry about peanut allergies.

6659056,maddogg,2022-05-25 08:47:00,178,We use Grandma's breading or Lily River breading.https://www.facebook.com/pg/Lily-Riv...=page_internal
6659072,proguidedream,2022-05-25 09:19:00,345,"i will have to try Andys , might even have a pack in the pantry someone gave me."
6659076,eyecatcher1,2022-05-25 09:27:00,323,I use Shore Lunch Cajun. Sometimes I pan fry and sometimes I make a beer batter with it.
6659078,Riding high,2022-05-25 09:32:00,69,I like catch and cook. Crunchy and mix it with the spicy sometimes. Sometimes I'll mix panko bread crumbs with it to be more crunchy. Not a fan of Andys but haven't tried the Cajun. I haven't tried the catch and cook beer batter either. Not into the thick batter on fish. May try it on onion rings and mushrooms.

6659230,bfish,2022-05-25 18:31:00,1096,2 parts flour 1 part white cornmeal (preferable 3 Rivers brand).
6659282,DE1952,2022-05-25 21:11:00,2,I mix the following: 1 cup Shore Lunch original 1 cup Sun Luck Japenese Bread Crumbs 1 Tbsp Old Bay 1 Tsp ground black pepper Egg wash before coating.
6659294,btyreprich,2022-05-26 04:23:00,1067,"I mut be missing something on breading based on these comments. I am the group cook and just coat the fillets first in all-purpose flour, then an egg wash, and then in breadcrumbs. Salt, pepper, and lemon slices are the condiments. However, based on the enthusiastic postings as which breading is best, I'll have to try one or two of these on our August trip. Thanks everyone for mentioning their favorites!"
6658860,proguidedream,2022-05-24 14:35:00,345,"enjoyed the oil thread , here are my rankings for best store purchased batter / coating most are available online now. or Northwest Ontario 1) Killer Krumbs (get the No MSG version if you dont like salty) needs a good eggwash for full Crunchy coverage 2) Catch and Cook - by Jay Seimens 3) Smiths Camps Critter coatings 4) Uncle Bucks Hot n Spicey (perfect coating no egg wash nice and light perfect spice) 5) Shore Lunch original (probably the best in the cast iron pan filled with butter and onions, true shore lunch style) Honourable mentions are the louisiana brand, and shore lunch beer batter. although the beer batter doesnt get made too often these days."
6658864,Ricky Spanish,2022-05-24 14:45:00,1298,"I started using Andy's (Cajun, Red or Yellow) after trying it with a guide on a shore lunch on Eagle Lake. I like dredging in Frank's Red Hot instead of milk or egg if I'm making fish tacos. Usually I skip the dredge and just shake damp fillets in Andy's. For extra crispiness I mix in some corn starch."
6658906,Cgillespie,2022-05-24 17:23:00,120,Another vote for Andy's Red.
6658908,v-bay gord,2022-05-24 17:25:00,3168,"Another vote for Andy's, and I've tried a bunch of others. Shore lunch is too salty for me."
6658916,kettyspanky,2022-05-24 17:36:00,271,We do Andy's and mix in a few smashed crackers.

6658940,bigwalleye1,2022-05-24 19:10:00,2632,"QFor a wet mix, I like Don's Chuckwagon and use beer or club soda for the water portion of the mix. I like it mixed more runny, the coating comes out lighter and crispier"
6658964,adempsey2.0,2022-05-24 20:33:00,611,"We typically use Fish Crisp, either Cajun or Regular. It's probably the most popular brand you find in most stores here. I would love to try some of the others. Might have to order a few online. However, my favorite is no coating at all. When I was young we used to scale our fish, remove the heads and fry them whole in butter on a foiled grill in the BBQ. So incredibly delicious. Nothing like the skin all crisped up with butter! Scaling is such a huge messy pain in the butt. I might just have to bite the bullet this year and bring out my fish scaler.... So, maybe my favorite coating is the skin?"
6658994,Terwalleye,2022-05-25 06:14:00,166,One vote for Zatirans Crispy Southern. No eggs wash. Just shake it up and fry.
