There is nothing better than feeling the tap of a walleye. When we get on fish, I can sit in the same spot all day and not get bored. Some say they like to see some new scenery and try different things. One rock looks like the next, one island looks like the next, I am on a fishing trip and if we are catching fish I am staying! Everyone enjoy your upcoming trips and catch fish, look at scenery or do whatever makes you happy, because unfortunately it will end to quickly and then we a will all be back at work."

I've got a fresh coat of DWR on my goretex and rubber boots and a bailing bucket. I'll be out there in a downpour if it comes to that. High wind and lightning *might* slow me down :-)My favorite lake had the shorline burn up last year, and the cabin is getting into poor repair, but as long as the fish don't care, I don't either."
