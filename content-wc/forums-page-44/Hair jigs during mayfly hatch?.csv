6659432,SterlingArcher,2022-05-26 14:34:00,92,Our annual trip to Lake Savant end of June/beginning of July very often coincides with a mayfly hatch that can make the bite tougher. On lakes here in Northern MN I love throwing hair jigs for smallies during fly hatches....wondering how it might work for walleyes?

If the wind is blowing into a shore the walleye will be there. Some of the best fishing I have had was during the mayfly hatch. Scott"

I wouldn't say we slayed them, but we caught a bunch of fish on them. I would think a hair jig in the right color pattern would be a great bait when used during a mayfly hatch."
