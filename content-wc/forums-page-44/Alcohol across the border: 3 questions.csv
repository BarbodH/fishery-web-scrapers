6659776,Bill Krejca,2022-05-28 16:26:00,6107,"It hasn't been legal, I doubt it has changed. Using them could be a good experiment for maybe whitefish, more likely perch, tho! Bill"
6659944,Riding high,2022-05-29 13:28:00,69,We've never had a problem bring open booze back to the US.
6660026,Terwalleye,2022-05-29 20:28:00,166,Oops menat $20 bottle
6660090,cuamb,2022-05-30 07:06:00,203,"We did bring a small amount of that back. No issues, it was in the truck box."
6660094,Bstar,2022-05-30 07:13:00,564,We always take in more than our limit of beer and liquor. We always tell the border agent exactly what we have. More often than not they have us pull over to pay the duty but some have let us go through. The duty is still cheaper than buying in Canada.
6660168,proguidedream,2022-05-30 10:55:00,345,as a canadian going back home from USA to Canada if we have an open bottle we just say we got one extra open bottle we responsibly did not drink all of . and they dont care
6660382,Schins,2022-05-31 03:59:00,92,Thanks again for all the responses
6660464,icspinner,2022-05-31 07:57:00,92,"Does anyone try to beat the excise tax by bringing the extra liquor internally? Just drink all the extra before getting to the border, plan on the numb feeling to last most of the week?"
6660550,Eckohlt,2022-05-31 11:30:00,3685,Thats a bad idea if you show up at the usa border pig drunk.
6659674,Schins,2022-05-28 08:13:00,92,"1) roughly how much extra does it cost to bring additional bottles of liquor across? 2) does declaring extra liquor increase the chance of getting pulled aside for inspection? 3) I should assume that open bottles should not be brought back in to the US when returning, so just leave them with the camp owner? Thanks"
6659688,Terwalleye,2022-05-28 09:59:00,166,1) It is percentage based. SO don't tell them it's Grey goose. Tell them it's a $240 bottle of vodka 2) If we admit we owe tax they have never searched us. Just pull over go in and pay and on your way. The one time we were ever checked we had coiincedentally brought only the limit allowed. I think they wanted to make sure 3) Don't leave in them camp. Finish them in camp!
6659694,walleyecheek,2022-05-28 10:49:00,2231,Buddy used to put his vodka in bottles that said Aquafina !!!
6659700,Eckohlt,2022-05-28 10:58:00,3685,Is there a vodka sniffing dog at the border??
6659702,Eckohlt,2022-05-28 11:01:00,3685,I have heard they have a night crawler n salted minnow sniffing dog now at the borders.
6659704,walleyecheek,2022-05-28 11:02:00,2231,"No, just marijuana sniffers !"
6659708,stjoeguy,2022-05-28 11:12:00,979,"1) I don't know how the charge is calculated. Three of us brought in 3 bottles of liquor and a case of beer. They charged on the lesser valued item, the beer. 2) No idea 3) I've brought open bottles back to MN from Ontario in the past. Mn open bottle law prohibits open bottles in the passenger space. It's OK in the trunk or truck bed. You'd have to check on what the open bottle laws are in the states involved."
6659718,David Anderson,2022-05-28 12:03:00,2073,"Per person it's 1.14L of hard liquor, or 1 case of beer, or 2 .75L bottles of wine. Only a couple of times we have been asked to pay extra, it's was about $20/ additional bottle beyond this. Once was when my friend was driving and stumbled with his answer. Question 2 is if you answer wrong or stumble with your answer, yes you might. I am always straight with my answers, direct and accurate, My friend once when asked told them what they had over, not disclosing what they had...big mistake, was ripped apart and it cost them an extra hour at the border and a footnote on their record. Monday 2 of us declared 2 - .75 bottles of red wine, 1 - .75 bottle of Crown Royal, 1 - 1L bottle of Bourbon. The guy asked me to repeat. We were .6L over, said have a good day. I never say a bottle of whiskey, 2 bottles of wine rather state exactly what it is. Duty is cheaper than trying to pull the wool over the border guys eyes."
6659728,RichA$1970,2022-05-28 12:53:00,1159,"Eck,Maybe if anyone wants to bring crawlers they can put them in a bottle of tequila. One question, does a 30 pack count as a case of beer?"
6659736,walleyecheek,2022-05-28 13:25:00,2231,I wonder if wax worms are legal ?
