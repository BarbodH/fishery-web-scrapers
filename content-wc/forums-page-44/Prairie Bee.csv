6660422,AnglerX,2022-05-31 06:17:00,1,Any suggestions for locations in late july/early august? I've seen a couple of references to a buoy near either the main camp or main landing (it wasn't clear which) marking a hump with good structure on it. I've also seen folks talk about the island just south of the main camp. First time to this lake and first time back in Canada in about 30 years so tips would be appreciated!
