6659092,7 Mag,2022-05-25 10:38:00,1887,That's a fun day of fishing when they are stacked up and you're not dealing with the weather.
6659130,Bill Krejca,2022-05-25 12:27:00,6107,"I used to camp right across from the entrance, a bit east. Fall is sure a great time to be up, the birch and poplar yellow up to create the picture postcard scenes. Bill"
6659248,Yellowfin123,2022-05-25 18:53:00,2182,"i went to most spots you told me about, i was on the south side hay island for a while and and worked my up into stevens bay, we thought we would try for some smallmouth up there and i just needed to see it, sometimes i have a tendency to sight see to much and went up into turtle lake all the way to the portage, caught a few small pike in the weed beds on the west side then on the way out we saw a bunch of birds diving outside the entrance and the heyday was on! this was the 7th or 8th of october, we were in the boat wearing shorts t shirts and barefoot!! we did not see another boat in all of stevens bay area, nothin! trees were yellow and reddish, as far as you could see looking east or west it was the smoothest water i've ever seen, the bay was like a mirror... it really was a sight to see that day and thank god i took the time to explore it"
6659258,Eckohlt,2022-05-25 19:08:00,3685,"I was up last Oct for the first week,probably never again will we see weather like that."
6655724,dstemp,2022-05-12 20:41:00,16,Im planning a trip to Stevens bay near Nester Falls in July will be a new area for me and second trip to Canada has anyone had experience there Open to suggestions for Resorts also
6655918,Hook_settr,2022-05-14 04:53:00,127,Bumping this back up to the top so that hopefully Bill will see it. He knows that area as well as anyone and will be a great source of information. Congrats on your upcoming trip! Hook_settr
6655938,Bill Krejca,2022-05-14 05:55:00,6107,"When I fished that area, I stayed at Young's Wilderness Camp, very nice place, may have to travel a bit, although the narrows right in front of camp can be good for walleyes if wind is blowing/has been blowing. Bill"
6656378,jambi,2022-05-16 07:20:00,504,Another vote for Young's Wilderness Camp. PM Sent.
6658644,dstemp,2022-05-23 19:51:00,16,Yes I will be staying at Young's wilderness camp Im wondering if the fishing will be different there last fall I was down just above Baudette south of Morson it was good but too much open water and dealing with the wind was a chore So Im hoping farther north will be better is the walleye pretty abundant there seems a few talk of Big Musky and Pike
6658684,muskyman73,2022-05-24 02:10:00,401,We pass it often and the location is good as the fishing is good for walleye and musky. Location is everything up there.
6658724,Riding high,2022-05-24 05:29:00,69,Not to be a Debbie downer but walleye fishing in the Morson area is way better. Now with that said Steven's Bay area is coming back. Musky in that area is real good. Smallmouth is good. If you're not afraid to venture out a ways you can get to some real good walleye fishing. Love Youngs camp. Good luck. Hope your trip is a great one.
6658946,dstemp,2022-05-24 19:39:00,16,Thank you for all the info Im hoping for a good trip never been that far up like I said in earlier post was down near Wheeler's point last fall it was nice fishing was fair wind was awful Stevens bay looks to be more confined as far as wind Im hoping the lodge was recommended by a work friend Going in mid July I will post updates
6659032,Bill Krejca,2022-05-25 08:07:00,6107,"Young's is well run, Carol is a sweetheart, camp is very nice. You may have to run a bit for fishing, but there are enough islands, so much different than the ocean to the south. Bill"
6659042,Yellowfin123,2022-05-25 08:19:00,2182,"i sure hit a little goldmine in stevens bay right at the entrance to turtle lake last oct, biggest baitball i've ever seen and the walleye were under it, all small stuff though.. pretty bay with the trees turning and the whole thing was a solid sheet of glass"
