6659952,stjoeguy,2022-05-29 14:08:00,979,The Winoga cabin is between Grace Island and Carling Island.
6659984,bigwalleye1,2022-05-29 16:36:00,2632,"Thanks, guys, for the pictures and info. I have been going since 1998 to Ftog, and thought 201; was high. We also had a trip on Rainy by that summer. Methinks this year will be eclipsing even that. Skywagon, could you share the Frog Rapids pic by private message? I can't save the image and would like to share it with the rest of our party. Thank you!"
6660024,Skywagon,2022-05-29 19:53:00,1106,PM sent.
6660110,Willyboy123,2022-05-30 07:38:00,73,Wow...that's a long way out. But I'll see if I can make it out one day that week.
6660318,Invader21,2022-05-30 19:42:00,105,"Just back yesterday from Donnelly's on the Pic Arm of Minnitaki. We were supposed to go to Manitou Falls but 105 and detours were intermittently closed, and water was still rising. We were afraid we'd get stranded (well, maybe afraid isn't the right term, lol). So we pushed back from that, and detoured to Donnelly's. Darrell was terrific! We had a great trip.Minnitaki was up at least 6-8 feet. Very different as the spots we used to fish were all much deeper or not easily fish able and most didn't hold fish while we were there. But we found our fish nonetheless. Even Redpine Bay was a bit spotty in its production, but we did pretty well overall after establishing new patterns.I've been going a little over a decade - highest I've seen it. And we heard the water is still predicted to rise in many places through the end of June. After all the outfitters have been through, and now this. Just very, very tough.Sent from my iPad using Tapatalk"
6660352,Pat T,2022-05-30 20:49:00,221,"We are at Gullrock right now. Camp owner said lake is up 38"". May have gone down a bit but still very high. Have to stand up behind windshield to lookout for floating debrey. Some of that floating debris could do some damage"
6659744,Obabikon,2022-05-28 13:55:00,2370,"Speaking strictly of Lake of the Woods It is above the high water mark of 2014. Basically, there was a surge in 2014 caused by a storm... that raised the lake 6 inches for a day or so, then it dropped. It hasn't reached that, but it is above the ""peak pool"" of 2014 at this point."
6659774,Bill Krejca,2022-05-28 16:22:00,6107,But I bet not as high as 1950/51. Bill
6659778,Eckohlt,2022-05-28 16:51:00,3685,Bill how old were you in 1950 if I may ask?
6659802,Skywagon,2022-05-28 20:03:00,1106,"I just got back from the cabin this afternoon, took some pictures on the way out of Sioux Lookout. This is a shot of Frog Rapids, the green you see in the picture is the roof of the boat house."
6659818,PRO-V16,2022-05-28 21:44:00,454,Wow! I've been going since 1993 and have never seen it this bad. The Rags certainly won't be an issue and I'm sure there is a heck of a flow through Manitou.
6659836,stjoeguy,2022-05-29 05:29:00,979,"Great picture! Thanks, Skywagon."
6659842,tv4fish,2022-05-29 05:51:00,2694,WOW - We have been going to Sioux Lookout since 1985 -- I don't think we have ever seen it that high !!!!!!!
6659856,Bill Krejca,2022-05-29 06:42:00,6107,Ha! I was 12 years old. Bill
6659874,Willyboy123,2022-05-29 07:37:00,73,Interesting chart. Looks like the water level on St Joe will be about right. Where's Winoga?
6659890,Obabikon,2022-05-29 08:34:00,2370,"So, it is not yet as high as the all time peak in 1950. I believe that it would need another 10-12"" to break that mark. It was expected to rise 3-6"" this week, and that was before the heavy rainfall that we might get was in the radar. So, unfortunately, we might be looking at that sooner than later."
6659388,bigwalleye1,2022-05-26 11:38:00,2632,"Anyone local to Sioux Lookout that can share any info on the water levels in Lac Seul this year? I see the Lwcb.ca website is showing higher than normal, but in terms of real life experience, how does what you're seeing now compare to 2014 I think when water levels all across the system, and rainy lake as well were higher than most of us have ever seen???"
6659424,Willyboy123,2022-05-26 13:54:00,73,"Not Lac Seul, but a little further north at Lake St Joseph, I'm hearing the water is up a couple of feet. Last time we were able to go (2020) it was down--so I welcome a bit more water. Going on June 10 this year."
6659430,SterlingArcher,2022-05-26 14:30:00,92,I saw a post from Ontario MNR that said part of Lac Seuel was 5' high &#x1f62c;
6659714,David Anderson,2022-05-28 11:41:00,2073,"Just got back from Sioux lookout and the water levels are extremely high. At Frog Rapids the water is up to the tops of their covered slip. The Sunset Inn is closed and I now understand, it's surrounded by water. If venturing out on the lake, pay attention as there is alot of wood floating around. Here is a picture across from Knobby's."
6659716,Eckohlt,2022-05-28 11:46:00,3685,Did ya catch any fish??
6659724,David Anderson,2022-05-28 12:40:00,2073,"Best trip I have had! 3 guys in my boat, one only fished 1/2 day, ended up with 279 walleyes and I know 80% were over 20 and 70 were over 22"". Fished Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. Because of the late ice out and high water, minnows were at a premium. We did real good on gulp."
6659726,Eckohlt,2022-05-28 12:44:00,3685,Sounds like a great trip overall.
6659730,stjoeguy,2022-05-28 12:56:00,979,"Holy cow! That's High!! The Frog Rapids boat slips are always a good lake level indicator on the way into Sioux Lookout. 2014 was a high year and I've seen that floatplane sitting in a pool of water, but never like this year. Here's that same plane and the pedestrian bridge and trail across from it in 2014."
6659732,stjoeguy,2022-05-28 13:10:00,979,This is from the Slate Falls F/B page a couple of days ago.
6659734,stjoeguy,2022-05-28 13:14:00,979,"Willyboy123, I'll be at the Winoga cabin June 11-18. Stop by and say hello if you're in the area. I've been watching the St. Joe lake level. Here's the latest:"
