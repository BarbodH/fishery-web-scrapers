6659374,Mojo-NC,2022-05-26 10:02:00,1929,"I had a similar experience last fall using the Z-Man TRD MinnowZ in the Bad Shad color threaded onto my jig hooks and a Charlie Brewer 3"" Grub in the Smoke Bluegill color nose hooked onto single 1/0 octopus hooks on my spinner rigs. The both worked so well that I may not use live bait again. We'll see how they work this year when we head back up in July. I especially liked using plastics because when I would get a bite and miss the fish, I didn't have to reel it back up to check my bait. I would just leave it out there because I knew the plastic was still on the hook. Sometimes I would catch 20 fish on a single plastic before it got too chewed up. I purchased some additional colors for this year too. We'll also have live minnows and crawlers to fall back on just in case, but I don't plan to use them unless the other guys are putting the smackdown on me. Links to both baits are immediately below.https://zmanfishing.com/store/catego...ch/TRD_minnowzhttps://sliderfishing.com/shop/ols/p...ed-tail-sbgf79"
6659450,ziggyzag,2022-05-26 17:28:00,125,Did that page say $4.19 per grub?
6659452,MotorPike,2022-05-26 17:37:00,5,Fine print says 10 per bag
6659454,Limeyangler,2022-05-26 17:49:00,563,"I'm a live bait guy but I love the Powerbait Powergrubs in Pearl/White, went to the store and checked online, seems like they discontinued that color anyone else find them?"
6659466,ziggyzag,2022-05-26 20:57:00,125,much better
6659472,SweetD,2022-05-26 21:33:00,243,"https://north40.com/berkley-gulp-jigging-grubLimey, this what you are looking for????"
6659622,drlee,2022-05-27 19:42:00,409,"Berkley Gulp 4"" smelt. Be specific on your purchase. Our go to bait the last couple of years. We still stock up on crawlers in Kakebeka Falls and Leeches north or Ignace for back up. Berkley Gup Leeches have been effective, but still testing."
6659918,martinbns,2022-05-29 10:44:00,1520,I fish a lot for Smallmouth and use a Zman TRD ticklerz or a hula stick with a bit cutoff. I found multiple times last year when I marked fish in deeper water in between spots the walleye just devoured them. Fished them just like a minnow and jig.
6659960,CI_Guy,2022-05-29 14:18:00,2118,Whatever someone else in the boat is using that I don't have any of and they don't have any extras.
6659140,Spartan1,2022-05-25 12:49:00,46,With the fly-in season just starting I'd be interested to know what everyone's #1 top plastic walleye bait is? Include favorite color. GO!
6659200,Mr Ranger,2022-05-25 16:39:00,272,"I like the 3 or 4"" Mister twister brown/orange tail or the translucent"

6659238,SweetD,2022-05-25 18:41:00,243,"Powerbait Twitchtail baits in these two colors!!! Absolutely slayed them on these last Fall! Canceled second half of week minnow order as they were fishing as fast ss live bait without the hassle of live bait. I have fished minnows for years and generally have been my go to. Hoping they perform as well again this year. If so, minnow order will be small to non-existent!"
6659298,Riding high,2022-05-26 04:49:00,69,We hit it big last year with northland tackle impulse jig crawler. And lunker city fin-s fish in pimp daddy and bubblegum ice color. 2.5 and 3.5 size.
6659308,dosxx,2022-05-26 05:15:00,60,Kalin’s Blue Pearl Salt and Pepper in 3” on a 1/4 ounce jug has been producing walleye for our group for 25 plus years.
6659318,guidedfishing,2022-05-26 06:06:00,531,"My go to is a 4 in B Fish N ringworm with a pearl tail, you can trim to any length and fish with 1/8 or 1/4 ounce jig. It can be fished a number of ways. Second is a Kalin 4in jerk minnow. Have great success with both, Ringworm is my go to."
6659324,REG,2022-05-26 06:22:00,445,"Anything by Zoom. And the color probably doesn't matter as much to the fish as it does to me, but Pearl is my go to. I can tell you from biting them to make a longer one shorter, they are salty. And the Walleyes seem to hold on to them plenty long enough to get the hood set."
6659340,NM_Trout,2022-05-26 08:50:00,1094,"Previously, the all time best for me was Havoc minnows. But I don't know that they can still be bought. I think that it is Mike Borger who likes a pattern color called ""electric chicken"". I got suckered into buying a couple of packages and will be giving that a try."
