Many fond memories of all those long trips north, stopping at most of the same places already mentioned. My favorite lakes were down the rail bed Tony had a key for access. Then the logging crews pretty much ruined it by fishing them out. I actually had an agreement with the at owner of the rail road right of way to purchase it. That's another story about how the logging company did an end around over me to end up controlling the rail bed. Then Brian starting requiring any trips back there had to be guided. Haven't been back since. I'm about an hour north of Waterloo, this will be 45 years now since my first trip to the McKenzie River in the NW Territories at 17 years old."

Would buy these grocery items the day before so it'd be pretty fresh. Assorted cold cuts, shredded lettuce, cheese, tomatoes, few onions, olive oil, and red wine vinegar. One year we ate on Highway 502 - traffic stopped for a good hour due to an accident. Made a sandwich for a trucker who said it was among the best as he'd ever eaten! Trucker took photos of the ""spread"" on our boat cover so he could make these at home!"

Friday night we stay in Emo after a stop at the Beer Store. Saturday noon we have lunch at Laura and Gram's ""Whiskey Jack"" which is just a few minutes from camp.

Cross the border, stock up, and fly out. The return trip is a quick stop at Border Bob's for some ice cream. Dinner is at Gordy's HiHat for some great burgers and cheese curds.

6658272,Bstar,2022-05-22 07:33:00,564,"For the past several years we've stopped at the Koffee Kup in Stoughton, WI for breakfast. Not too far off of the interstate but worth it. Little old style diner with great food and they get you in and out pretty quick. Then we're good until Superior where we stop for a Subway and eat at the park by the water. We cross at IFalls and stay at the Rendezvous in Fort Frances. We like that once we get there everything we need is there, a bar, a resturant, waterfront seating, did I say a bar? We eat breakfast there in the morning, the best and biggest blueberry pancakes, and head up to Dryden where we pick up bait at the Queen Street Laundry and Bait and then get a bucket of KFC for our evening meal. We make a quick stop at the Walmart for some of our perishable foods which will include eggs this year. Then on to Sioux Lookout where we spend a night at Slate Fall's bunkhouse or at a motel. We don't have any ""favorite"" gas stations, just stop when we need to. Coming home we usually stay at a motel south of Superior. This year in Solon Springs and then the rest of the way the next day. Just want to get home at that point."

Then drive to camp sat. morning. Then a few of us youngsters could leave on thursday so we would drive to eau claire......hit water street and get into a good one...sleep in a bit then friday head to I-falls with a stop at the Choo Choo for bloodies in superior. then a stop in gander in duluth to buy things we dont need. ha. Next stop was Orr for Ice cream and then I falls for a cookout and beers. Younger days..off to the roadhouse for the night and another rough morning. Man...i do not miss my younger days. ha. One year at the roadhouse we got mixed in with a bachorlette party. We ended up on their party bus headed over the border to fort francis. Needless to say a cab got us back to I Falls hotel about 5am and we walk in thinking we could sneak in a hour of sleep and the crew is in lobby waiting for us. Yeah...brutal first day. Sure glad i grew up. ha. My trip is much more relaxing and enjoyable as I got older. haha.
6657606,lmoore,2022-05-20 06:59:00,40,"When my grandpa was still going on the trip, we had the exact same route and stops every year. We would meet up in Spirit Lake, Iowa and then let his little black book take over from there. He had notes on all the gas stations he had tried over the 30 or so years of making that trip and we usually stopped at the same ones because he would have a note from prior years that the turn out of another on was difficult with traffic, or something like that. We sometimes would change things up for supper, but usually it was the Emerald Grill in Grand Forks, ND because it was right next to the gas station we stopped at there. We even had a specific spot along the side of the road just outside of Winnipeg where we would stop every year in the middle of the night to pee. Somewhere we still have his old handheld GPS with ""Pee Place"" marked on it . We always stopped in Ashern, Manitoba at the Petro-Canada on the south end of town and slept for 3 or so hours until they opened for breakfast and then made the rest of the trip that morning."
6657608,stjoeguy,2022-05-20 07:01:00,979,"My wife usually makes caramel rolls to have before we leave and on the way north. Lunch has always been in Fort Frances. It used to be La Place Rendez-Vous, but that got a little slow at times, so we switched to Harbourage. When random covid tests came up last fall, La Place Rendez-Vous came back in favor since they have a good internet connection to complete the test. Dinner in Sioux Lookout at Forest Inn. Saturday morning coffee at Tim Horton's before we drive north or fly out. The first nights dinner is always fish, potatoes, onions and beans. The last night is always spaghetti. My wife's biscuits and gravy is on the breakfast menu twice every year. I usually make Bloody Marys for anyone interested when we get back from the day's fishing. i don't drink them at home, but it's become a Canada trip thing. On the return, we have late breakfast/early lunch at Pelican Lake Sandwich (used to be Robin's Donuts). Supper is at DQ in Int. Falls, which is sometimes the last place we're all together before heading home on different routes."

6657614,Bill Krejca,2022-05-20 07:18:00,6107,"Stops along the way seem to be dictated by the changing ""maturity factor"". Used to run straight through after all day at work, made 5 portages once after the drive up. Since the stops depend on destination, sometimes the choices can be very few, e.g. run to Snow Lake up through Winnipeg. Now usually lay overnight on way up and straight through going home. It helps to break in the young fellers at an early age, as they have the endurance of which I once took advantage. Not much for cool stopping places, but that can really enhance the trip for many folks, and just increase the memory experience. Bill"
6657618,lmoore,2022-05-20 07:26:00,40,Where at around Snow Lake? We'll be headed up there the last week of June. Normally we stay on Tramping at the lodge but we'll be staying in town this year since they are booked up by the mine.

When we fly to anywhere in Minnesota, we drive up to Dryden on Day 1 and spend the night there. We like to start out the trip with a nice walleye dinner at The Riverview Lodge, even when we don't stay the night at the lodge. When we fly to Winnipeg, we spend the night in Kenora on Day 1 and like to have dinner and a couple beers at Lake of the Woods Brewing Co."

But for years and years the big group we always stopped at Paul Bunyans in the Dell's for breakfast. We use to also stop at the Choo Choo as you come into Superior. Use to make it a 2 day trip on the way up...just because we could and stay at the Antler Inn at Eue Claire and cook out. In I-Falls always stay at the same hotel and would grill out. A stop in Orr, minnesota for some ice cream at times but not open anymore. Homeade Ice cream...2 huge scoops for like 2.00. Once in Canada always a stop for their candy and Macintosh toffee and malkins jam. On the way back...a stop at a nice hotel and always a steak dinner."
6657514,btyreprich,2022-05-19 19:23:00,1067,"Thanks for the topic - I often think about the stops we have made over the years going to Canada. We used to leave Friday after work and drive straight through to the lodge so as to be there for almost a full day of fishing on Saturday. We now overnight in International Falls. Our stops would have us eating at Perkins in Eau Claire and buying sweet corn from the farmer's stand across the street. Dinner would be at The Saw Mill in Virginia or the Mexican restaurant in International Falls. The Hilltop Motel in I.F. is our favorite motel on way up. Seems like we also have our ""favorite"" gas stations to stop at both on the way up & back. One the ride up while driving through northern Wisconsin, we'd pass by a dive bar called The Poodle Inn. We always wanted to stop in for a beer but never did. Sadly the bar is now closed."

We cross at pigeon river crossing and we are there in a hour. On our way home we leave early and cross at pigeon river and stop at rydens store for trinkets.
