Should be a great trip as always, and we are bringing two crews of newbies so that should make it interesting getting them with the program. I have seen a number of reports of high water on the lake so far. Hoping that doesn't make thing more interesting than normal, but we are a bit over a month out. If anyone is up that way, please post what you see for water, flow, temps, etc.. Be safe everyone and enjoy the upcoming holiday. Safe travels to all."

High water just means heavier current , and possibly visable rocks now under water.. shouldnt be driving close to visable rocks anyways following a good map. heavier current means possibly better fishing. or new current seams that produce. i suspect it might go down a bit in the next month , but that does depend on rain. basically to the high water mark you would see on shore rocks in the past"
