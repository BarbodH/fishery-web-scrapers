6660276,DE1952,2022-05-30 16:30:00,2,Has anyone traveled Gordon Lake Rd north from 17? We're heading up to Forest Lake Lodge and it would be much shorter going this route vs continuing on 17 to Vermillion Bay and then taking 647. I'm concerned about its condition and whether or not it's flooded right now.

There is a sign in VB claiming 647 is closed, but this wasn't the case. Forest Lk in McIntosh was close to overflowing, but didn't. Water was receding when I left. 105 was still closed, Quibell Road detour was a bit messy, road crews could barely keep ahead of keeping in patched up. On my way out on Sat., a big gravel truck had apparently hit a soft spot and was up to the axels. But generally fine, just take it slow."
