6658288,jdfire,2022-05-22 08:29:00,16,"Minnitaki is a great lake to fish. The sanctuaries open on the 15th, we will be making our annual trip the 17th. The rice is closed during the period before the 15th and Red Pine is catch and release only. The specific regs are covered in zone 4 page 32 of the Ontario regs. The Rice is marked pretty well at the entrance, as is Red Pine. Here are the regs.https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=...5XZNNmgIIxTz3eAs several other people have mentioned, be careful. There are plenty of areas with rocks that will ruin a trip that appear to be in open water. People in our group have found out the hard way. Although losing the lower unit did give him an excuse to buy a new Yamaha. Navionics has a decent lake map for Minnitaki. Good luck.JD"

6658888,valley366,2022-05-24 16:22:00,193,Looks like there is a map for east and west. I have gotten these for other lakes and not the greatest for accuracy of depth but at least gives you something to go off of.http://www.canadamapsales.com/en/cat.../index~p6.htmlAlso looks like they are available on the Navionics app if you have a phone or tablet to use them on.https://webapp.navionics.com/#boatin...ed%7BoHf%7CxoP
6659144,Bill Krejca,2022-05-25 12:59:00,6107,"Ha! Supposedly, when Sam Clemens (Mark Twain) was a Miss. river boat pilot, a lady asked him if he knew where all the shallows were, and he replied, ""No mam, I just know where they ain't!"" Bill"
6656830,RLundin,2022-05-17 11:57:00,22,"Heading to Minnitaki lake in mid June. What can you tell me about these Fish Sanctuaries on Minnitaki? I see that they are closed for fishing until June 15? If I'm looking at a map, were are these located at? Grassy Bay and English River - between English Falls downstream to include all of Grassy Bay of Minnitaki Lake Twin Bay and the Rice River - including Twill Lake, Flower Lake, Twinflower Lake, Purity Lake, Parnes Lake and connecting streams, Twinflower Creek, and Twin Bay of Minnitaki Lake (collectively known as the Rice River) and waters extending approximately 300 metres north, to the parallel of latitude 49°58′34""N., drawn across Minnitaki Lake"
6657006,PRO-V16,2022-05-17 21:09:00,454,"If you get a good map or the fishing map for that area it names those spots. If you do the English, prepare for a lot of company. Most every sanctuary is an inlet to the lake, shallow bays or small connected lakes."
6657008,prov1800,2022-05-17 21:09:00,5010,Your coming mid June and sanctuaries open mid June.Your good to go.
6657088,rockape,2022-05-18 08:16:00,215,"I've been in those sanctuaries many times on the day they open. Let's just say you almost can drop a bare jig down and catch fish. They have to be thicker than ever since no Americans could fish there the last 2 years. Unfortunately, I don't know if I am going to make it this year. All of my crew are now either disabled, no vacation, stupid excuses, or not vaccinated. If you see a big guy in a boat all by himself, that is probably me! I'm going come **** or high water. We have the high water part. Not sure I want the ****, although all of my friends are making me feel like I am in **** right now!"
6657164,RLundin,2022-05-18 12:15:00,22,Are there any decent online maps of Minnitaki lake that you are aware of?
6657194,PRO-V16,2022-05-18 13:05:00,454,Try Canada Map Company. Can't remember what mine are as I'm gone fishing. The gas station just south of Sioux Lookout where the road turns to Hudson usually has good ones for the whole area.
6657354,rockape,2022-05-19 06:59:00,215,"I have a bad *** old school hydrographic map of Minnitaki, Big V, and LAc Seul. LOVE them. They are fairly big so you have to fold them. I think Minnitaki might be 2 maps. I bought them like 18 years ago in the sporting goods store in Sioux Lookout. Maybe they still have some. They do sell decent maps at any bait shop around there. Esso at 72 and 664 might have some. They used to when it was Fred and Dee's. There aren't too many rocks/hazards on Minnitaki. With the water being really high, there isn't anything to worry about. Marked well with buoys too."
6657356,prov1800,2022-05-19 07:14:00,5010,Your advice is going to get a lot of guys in trouble and cost them some cash.Theres lots of areas where you better know where your going and know with the high water a lot of the boulders and rocks you could normally see are just hidden under the surface and you better know where they are.Definatly not very good advice to give people.Maybe you know the lake but whole different ball game to a newly.
6657448,PRO-V16,2022-05-19 13:54:00,454,"I agree with you PROV1800. Plenty of hazards out there. My friend has fished that lake for 40 years. Hit a rock out in deep water. Knocked off the lower unit, cowling flew off the motor and hit his daughter and scraped the hull on his Ranger. They weren't but yards off his GPS trail. Another friend following saw it hit and cut the throttle stopping short. Result- lost the whole week fishing, had to buy a new motor and get the hull fixed. We knocked off a skeg and wrecked a prop coming out of the Donut. Just feet off our trail."
6657456,Bill Krejca,2022-05-19 14:33:00,6107,"I don't know anything about the water in question. It is my guess, though, with the high water, that a fair number of folks will hit previously seen tiny islands which now may be under water. I believe we just naturally tend to steer away from stuff protruding form the water, but maybe don't include them in our memory bank when the island gets submerged.Bill"
