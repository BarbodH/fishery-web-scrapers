Obabikon lake was in the 51 range.Fishing overall was pretty slow. I attribute it to the cold weather. We caught plenty of walleye to eat, but certainly weren't having the 100 fish days that we expect. Caught walleye between 8' and 30'... which obviously is quite a range. They haven't really moved up shallow. Pike fishing was also slow. It seemed to pick up this afternoon, and I'm hoping tomorrow's temps being in the 60's (instead of 40's) will kickstart the fish!Also, still jigging up bass in 15-20'. Need some warm weather to get everything back on track.Water level is absolutely insane! We desperately need it to stop. We are at 2014 levels now. At this point, one major storm will cause more dock damage than anyone could imagine.Note: ANYONE boating on ANY lakes that are experiencing this type of flooding... please slow down. Do not buzz islands with homes or resorts. Try to avoid all wakes around any structures. Erosion and dock damage is already going to be unbelievable. Please do your part... slow down WAY before you get to any dock, and avoid sending wakes in their direction."

Feels like we're bailing a sinking boat right now It might come up a few more inches, but if we can avoid substantial rain... it should start to lower in the next week or so. . That said... there is rain in the forecast Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. Let's hope they're wrong. Walleyes are biting, but deep (25-30'). With the nice weather we're having, they should move up shallow. They're still spawning. Pike are scattered, but eating. A handful of bass and musky have been caught. Perch are currently pretty non existent."
