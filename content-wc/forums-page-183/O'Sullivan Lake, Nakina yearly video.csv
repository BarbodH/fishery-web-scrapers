5681402,Rich B,2017-07-24 10:00:00,1081,"Another excellent video Nathan.....of course you do have great film footage to work with (ha) from your trips. Have always enjoyed watching your videos, no doubt almost as much as you enjoy filming them Congrats on another great fishing trip up north. Rich B"

The fishing was awesome and the weather cooperated, nothing like hanging out with great friends and family and enjoying that breath-taking country. Can't compare to some of the videos posted here, but I have fun making them and I hope you do watching. https://youtu.be/S46C8qbNKtw"

5675162,pjshorthorn,2017-07-20 07:35:00,5654,"Great video Nathan. It looks like you had a great trip overall. I had to laugh when I saw the shots of Lake Superior on your way up. It appears we both thought this was a great view....LOL. We also had a close encounter with a bear on our drive.......we just didn't try to feed it !!!! We came up over a rise and there he was in the middle of the road crossing into our lane. I was able to stop about 20 ft short of it, but he almost became a hood ornament . Beautiful drive along the north shore of Superior. PjShorthorn"

5678410,fsz,2017-07-21 16:19:00,144,"Live to jig, Nice video! Do you guys troll bottom bouncers with spinners to locate fish and then jig? Any pike? How far from camp for good fishing (within half an hour or 40 minutes?) Sorry for all the questions, thinking of trying that lake next year with my sons (high school age). We focus on walleye but my sons like getting into pike for variety Thanks"
5678530,Live to jig,2017-07-21 19:37:00,159,"Yes we bottom bounce to find them over a very specific depths and bottom, when we double up we then try Jigging. I can think of at least 5 spots within 5 minutes of camp and many more within 10 minutes. In fact we have caught many in the bay in front of camp. We don't fish for Pike but there are many weed filled bays that hold Pike in good numbers. I know a couple of guys that fish deep for the big Pike and Lakers later in the year. Hope that helps."
5679474,fsz,2017-07-22 19:25:00,144,"That helps. Mainly want to avoid 1 hour runs to get to good fishing it seems like a pretty big lake In addition to O'Sullivan rainbow and the other outfitter, are there any private cabins or camps that add to boat traffic."
5679578,Live to jig,2017-07-22 21:53:00,159,"I would say if you run more than a 1/2 hour you have passed more than half the fish in the lake! We might see 3 or 4 boats a day, some days much less."
