5681994,Lazy Fisherman,2017-07-24 15:15:00,276,"North Caribou Camps also includes in their price your hotel in Thunder Bay the night before your departure to their camp. Also, there are camp caretakers that take care of the boats and make sure everything is running well."
5683250,Larry S,2017-07-25 08:22:00,665,"As Elway12 Stated to many people its a matter of Money You want to pay $ 2400 + Tax to be more comfortable fine. For around $ 1500 + Tax, total about $ 1700 you can get the same value fishing wise, access to a great lake where you can do your own thing without a caretaker . I have the time to drive to Pickle lake and will save Approx $ 1000 by going to Pickle Lake Outposts I fits a matter of comfort Pay Approx $ 2750 and go to N Caribou camps"
5683986,adempsey2.0,2017-07-25 14:54:00,612,"PLO is a great option for sure. Especially for a lake this size and remoteness; and for $1215 USD +HST is a bargain.NCCs posted rate is $2295 USD + HST. That includes overnight stay in TBay, flights from TBay to the camp and staple foods. Also a great deal and saves time and adds some convenience. Even more convenient is flying into TBay. So its a great option for those who have to drive 20+ hours. Although, you could still do that and rent a van and drive the remainder to Pickle Lake.Sent from my SM-G903W using Tapatalk"
5684130,Larry S,2017-07-25 16:59:00,665,My mistake on N Caribou camps rates .I missed by $ 100. My sister & I flew into Thunder Bay from Las Vegas and got a Great deal on a rental car for 12 days total bill was less than $ 300 We will be returning at same time to Pickle Lake Outposts next year Fishing on N Caribou was Just Too Good to Ignore and go to another lake.
5660066,phishfearme,2017-07-12 06:26:00,1242,"We just returned from an incredible 9 day week at Pete Johnson's North Caribou Lake outpost. The group consisted of Walleyecentral charter member LarryS, his sister Pat and Wil and my boat partner Gary. This huge lake (80,000 acres) has to be considered as one of the best walleye lakes in Ontario  or Canada  or the world for that matter. It is remarkably fertile with minnows crowding every inch of shore line and is quite clear  you could watch fish hit the jig in 7-8 ft of water. For some reason the tannic staining in most NW Ontario lakes is only minimally present here WALLEYE  the biggest positive of walleye fishing here is the ease and frequency with which you can catch larger walleye. The sheer number of 19-21 inch fish was off the charts. It is easy for almost anyone to catch 50 walleye per day (even within sight of the cabin) with 100 per day achievable if you fish long enough  and I would estimate that 60% of the fish caught were in that 19-21 inch range. All you had to do was find 8-9 ft of water near deeper water and the fish were there and accommodating. The really large or trophy walleye (27 inch and up) eluded us  at least in this part of the lake - as our maximum was 24 inches with a few 23 inchers. Pete assures us that trophies are caught every year  but not based on our experience. PIKE  although this lake has a reputation for trophy pike (more than 40 inches) we were unable to find any of the big girls and we spend a good bit of time focusing on pike. We did manage to get some nice ones including a 39incher, 2 x 38, 37, 2 x 36, 2 x 35 and 3 x 34 and some others over 30 - lots of fun but no real trophies. A group of 8 guys that were in the cabin the week before us focused a great deal on pike and could only manage one 36 incher. BOATS AND MOTORS  by far the BEST we've ever had in the bush. 17ft Alaskans with floor boards, captains seats and 25 hp Evenrudes with electric starts that started first time everytime. The only issue we had was that the bilge pumps did not work and manual bailing was a pain. You can see a video of these in the like below. CABINS  quite rustic and not at all fancy but very roomy and functional. There's a cabin for cooking/eating/drinking and one for sleeping. You can see these in more detail at:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwk9...ature=youtu.be Overall, this was one of our best trips  and if we could've stumbled upon a few trophies it would've indeed been the best. The cost was reasonable  Pete charges $1520 Canadian for 7 days ($1200 US) and provides an immediate HST rebate by charging only half the HST. There is another outfitter on the opposite side of the lake who is much more expensive. We rebooked for next year in order to retest the lake for trophies. Phish"
5660138,Mike Borger,2017-07-12 07:02:00,1554,"Thanks for posting! Nice to hear that Larry and his sister had a good trip.Very cool that Pete upgraded his boats, that's a huge plus on that lake. His operation is certainly a cheaper alternative if you don't mind making the drive to Pickle Lake.Weird about the lack of big pike, but it sounds like the walleye made up for that!Cheers"
5660554,Larry S,2017-07-12 09:47:00,665,"Having been on this trip to N Caribou with fishfearme I agree with all of what he has said. I went to N Caribou in 2007 and also had a Great Trip that year with several differences. First in 2007 the weather was Awful, everyday rainy and temps in the upper 40's & lower 50's The weather this year was very good except the first day getting off the float plane was rainy & windy. Rest of the week temps in 60's & 70's with and occasional rain shower Trip in 2007 was at the other camp on the lake Fishing was Excellent, if you went 5 minutes without catching a fish you were(Ha,Ha) bored. Walleye size as fishfearme stated was 60% 19 inches & up We caught most of them in 3 to 13 FOW . Used jig & Twister tails 95% of the time. As we do on these fly-ins we brought a flat of nitecrawlers, but ended up not using them My sister & I didn't beat the water for pike , but still got a 38, 36 and numerous in the low 30's.The Walleye fishing was just Too **** good for us to go looking for pike. On another note my sister snagged a perch for her first fish of the trip, the only perch caught all week Camp has 2 buildings One to cook in and One to sleep in with 8 beds, also a single bed in cooking cabin. 2 outhouses, a shower house with an on demand hot water heater which gives you all the hot water in the shower house you want. There is water in cooking cabin , but its cold. Boats were great 18 ft Lund Alaskans with 25 electric start Evinrude 2 cycle motors You just had to check oil and add every few days. Plenty of gas with a hand pump to full your tanks"

5661546,tooski,2017-07-12 20:23:00,393,I'll say this- you guys sure live the good life on your trips. Cocktails and a spread that might rival Camp Chef's. Plus great report....
5661738,pjshorthorn,2017-07-13 05:21:00,5654,"Phish, You wear that shirt very well. Hopefully it somehow made it home in your luggage Thanks for sharing your trip details. Sounds like an awesome trip. PjShorthorn"
5661906,fishmanric,2017-07-13 06:52:00,219,My first trips to Canada were on this body of water back in the seventies. Canvas covered 2x4 constructed tents were what we had in those days. First day in was working on getting enough motors to run. Fishing back then was more like a dream.
5680882,elway12,2017-07-23 22:11:00,335,Sounds like my kind of lake and fishing! Do you know how many camps/outposts there are on North Caribou?
5681106,fishmanric,2017-07-24 07:31:00,219,Sunset country list two. http://www.northcaribou.com/ and http://picklelakeoutposts.com/
5681218,Larry S,2017-07-24 08:27:00,665,"There are 2 camps on N Caribou. It all depends what you want in a camp Pickle Lake Outposts is a more typical outpost camp You have to drive to pickle Lake and fly-in to lake. Cabin has separate shower, and only cold water into cooking cabin. Boats are 18 ft with 25HP electric start No indoor toilets, outhouses The other camp North Caribou Camps flies directly from Thunder Bay to Weaganow Indian Reservation where you transfer to float plane to camp. camp has indoor toilets and provides basic staple foods The difference is Price Pickle Lake Outposts around $ 1500 CDN for a week. North Caribou $ 2400 US Both provide excellent camps Its what you want to Pay and taking an extra days(days) to drive to Pickle lake."
