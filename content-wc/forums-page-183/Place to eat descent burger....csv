5680170,Golden Eagle,2017-07-23 12:23:00,2642,Restaurant at Howey Bay Motel in Red Lake serves a great burger on their lunch menu. No need to tell them how you want it cooked because it's going to be well done. Seems that's the way it's done in Canada. Seems like a good idea to me. No rare ground beef for me.
