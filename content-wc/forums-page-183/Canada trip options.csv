5646265,valley366,2017-07-04 21:27:00,193,Looking at booking a place for next year for my boys. Looking at June 9th-15th. They are 8 and 11 and will be their third trip to Canada.We have done Cedar Lake and the English River. Looking for something different for next year.Mainly looking for Walleyes with good action and a chance for something nice sized for bonus. We would also chase some Smallmouth but not avid Bass fisherman.Have 3 places in mind:Five Lakes Lodge on Gullrock. http://www.fivelakeslodge.com/Woman River Lodge. http://www.womanriver.com/Tall Pines Camp on Wabskang Lake. http://www.tallpinescamp.com/index.htmlEach one looks good. Looking for housekeeping cabin with a rental boat.If anyone has any information on the listed places would appreciate any guidance.We mainly jig fish and like using lighter jigs. 1/8 or 1/4 ounce. Found kids have hard time fishing fast current with heavy jigs this past year.If anyone has any other places in mind that are faced pace fishing willing to check them out.Thanks in advance.
5646289,Slim03,2017-07-04 22:13:00,159,Take a look at Lost Island Lodge on Lac Seul. I just got home tonight from taking my 9 year old and my dad. Non stop action and great hospitality from the Hayes family.
5646401,martinbns,2017-07-05 05:39:00,1520,"My wife and I sent to Five Lakes Lodge on Gull Rock last year, we had a good time. Ian and his wife are great hosts. We used our own boats but his looked to be pretty good. We caught lots of Walleye and a few pike. The Lake is easy to navigate, the good fishing spots are very easily identified. IF you are struggling, Ian will come out on the lake and show you around."
5646921,HeHooksHimself,2017-07-05 08:33:00,725,"Of the three places you mention, I have only fished Woman River Camp. We have an affinity for this camp but have only fished it 2 or 3 times (I honestly can't remember- getting old sucks). Paul and Debbie run a great operation and the walleye are plentiful in the system. The water is huge and the time spent getting to places can be long, but of course it is beautiful country. We are going there this September, so I will post a report. There is also good smallie fishing in Little Woman Lake and lake trout in the system. If you are leaning toward Wabaskang, I might suggest you consider Wine Lake Camp. You cross Wabby to get to this water and the fishing is great, in my opinion. Check it out and tell Nick I sent you if you consider it. I hope you have a wonderful adventure with your boys! FISH ON! Hooks"
5647186,valley366,2017-07-05 10:35:00,193,Thanks for the input so far. Will look at Lost Island Lodge. Don't know what it is about Lac Seul but have never really considered it. Maybe scared by size of lake.I looked at Wine Lake Camp but did not know if got too primitive for me. Looks like a nice place and have read stories about the ice house trips.Like the options at some of these places of doing another lake with boats setup there. Get to experience something different.
5680834,valley366,2017-07-23 21:32:00,193,Made our decision and booked Five Lakes Lodge for June 2018. All the places we looked at looked great and probably have great fishing. Ian at Five Lakes sounds like a great guy and spent a good amount of time on the phone with me answering questions. Looking forward to next year.Thanks for the pointers. Will be looking for reports come June.
5680850,gullrockguy,2017-07-23 21:43:00,44,"you will have a great time, the fishing on gullrock has been amazing this year/ lots of eaters, lots of little ones for the kids to catch. and lots of quality over sized fish. the northers are very agressive and will put some excitement into the boat."
5681090,martinbns,2017-07-24 07:23:00,1520,"Ian is a great guy, you will enjoy yourselves."
5682210,DaBirdman,2017-07-24 16:32:00,164,"This isn't on your list, but LaBelle's Birch Point Camp on Northwest Bay of Rainy Lake might be one to consider. It isn't ""up there"" like the places you've listed, but they have great accommodations and really nice new 17ft Alumacraft tillers set up with 50hp Yams. Plenty of walleye of all sizes, and the bass & pike will be in similar areas as well. Might even be able to run into some bonus slab crappies as well. Very affordable too IMO."
