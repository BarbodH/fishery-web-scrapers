5685066,Seanik,2017-07-26 10:24:00,218,"The Trip to Sainte Anne du Lac, Quebec. for a fly in to Lac Natakim begin on June 22nd, the drive from Erie, Pa was pleasant and un-eventful. We enjoyed the ferry crossing East of Ottawa which routes you away from downtown Ottawa. The deluxe cabin (Natakin West) is one of three on this 8 mile long lake, there are many large arms and bays to explore. The cabin was one of the best I ever stayed in with 4 bedrooms, large bathroom and shower, modern kitchen, food prep island, solar led lighting, comfortable couch and lazyboy chair. The boats were 14' Lunds with 8 hp 4 stroke merc's.The Lake was absolutely loaded with small Walleyes in the 14""-15"" range, most were caught in 15"" of water but only 7' down with a hook and crawler. The largest walleye was 24"" and that was the only one to be above 16""s. We really didn't fish for pike but one 37""er was caught with the occasional 25""er.At the end of all my trips to Northern Canada, I ask myself would I return to this lake in the future, and the answer to Lac Natakin is ""NO"" because of the small consistant sized walleye,The accommodation were fantastic, the outfitter was extremely helpful and friendly but the Quebec people we encountered along the way in restaurants, motels, stores, and gas stations didn't speak English only French, I thought Canada was bi-lingual, and were for the most part very un-friendly. We felt they were glad to take our money but it was a bother to serve us.Also Quebec does not refund 1/2 of it's provincial sales tax to foreign visitors as does most other Canadian provinces.My future Canadian fishing trips will probably not be to Quebec.Seanik"
5685794,fishron,2017-07-26 16:36:00,317,"Thanks much for the report from the Moselle territory. I'm considering a trip in to Sand Lake next June. I'm waiting for a report from a group fishing there right now. Catching small walleye with little hope of larger fish is not very compelling. The fact that you can drive to the fly-in site on hard roads is. I've fished with my group in years past on the Cabonga reservoir which is not too far to the west of the Moselle area where in the years before them messing with the water level we caught walleye in good numbers and size. My first thirty incher came from the Cabonga along with pike to 40 inches. Deer horn lodge is a good camp and from what I've heard is being improved. If the Moselle territory doesn't seem worthwhile I may try Deer horn again. Our group has great memories of the walleye, pike and lake trout fishing there along with bear and moose sightings that compel us to give it another try. The 2017 year rainfall may keep them from dropping the water level that killed our fishing spots. Thanks again for the report. The twelve to thirteen hour drive to Deer horn on good roads means more to us each year."
5686186,retire55,2017-07-26 20:53:00,1029,"Perhaps you are unaware that the legislated language of work in Quebec is French (to help protect the French language). Not surprisingly then, most Quebecers speak French at work, and no doubt at home as well. After all, French is their mother tongue. In a 2011 Quebec census, out of 7.815 million respondents, 7.663 million identified French as their first language. In the same 2011 survey, less than 30% of respondents identified with any capability in the English language. Consider that in rural and remote areas of Quebec, there is no incentive to speak English. Fortunately for you, your outfitter was bilingual and was able to satisfy your requirement to communicate in English. Perhaps the few Quebecers you came across (other than your outfitter) didn't speak English because they were not capable of speaking English or were too shy to try to communicate in English."
5695698,octanehi5,2017-08-01 09:18:00,1104,"I have fished northern Quebec for more than 20+ yrs. Always got by with my lack of speaking french.never having a real problem. Remember you are in their country not ours.Its unfortunet that most of the southern Quebec lakes have been over fished.because of their easy access.Catching that many small walleye does make the future of Natakim look Brighter. I last fished this lake about 16 yrs ago.Did not catch enough fish for a fish fry,all week. I would not return for free.If you like easy access try the gouin, Or bite the bullet and fly in with Air tamarac out of clova, they also offer trips from St.ann du lac to any of their lac's. Its a much harder ride but worth your time.The best fishing for walleye in Quebec. Ron I have been to sand lac, It was a good lac do not miss the hike to the small trout pond on the top of the hill, Quebec Reds? The guys posting on here know what kind of fishing I like. Already booked June 2018 you can guess What Lac. I wish you all great Trips"
5695930,Seanik,2017-08-01 11:36:00,218,"Retire55 & Octanehi5 My first trip to Quebec happened in 1968, it was to Lac Mistassini, many more trips followed to the Gouin and the areas around Senneterre. Most of the time language was not a barrier to making our trips enjoyable, I understand French is the predominate language of Quebec but Canada is a bi-lingual country and it's citizens at the very least should make an effort to be friendly and communicate in the second language. This year, we as a group of fishermen spent in excess of 6000.00 dollars in Quebec, we felt and were treated as intruders and aliens most of the time. It would be difficult for our group to return and I hope our experience's in 2017 were isolated to this trip and not what generally happens. We will be going to Western Ontario in 2018. Seanik"
5696906,MonstBlitz,2017-08-01 20:49:00,16,"We did Natakim for 3 trips and found it to be the same as you. Many small walleye and slow pike fishing. Sand Lake was MUCH better(see trip report). Always found everyone in St Anne Du Lac to be very friendly, even those who don't know much if any English. The folks at the new outfitter that replaced Air Melancon are very friendly."
