5684482,fishpoop,2017-07-26 00:43:00,630,"http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/marinesafety...WT.mc_id=tc35aIt's best to get the information from the horse's mouth and not the horse's (sorry, but I've been looking for a reason to use that emoticon. lol and it's not directed at any poster in this thread. Just trying to be funny)My last trip to fishing paradise north of the U.S. border was '08 and I had never heard anything about this subject up to that time so I was surprised to learn of it here in this thread. So I thought I'd better find out more because someday I hope to return to fishing paradise. The key information for me and other U.S. folk planning on going up is this line here; ""Proof of competency is not required in the following situations: a visitor to Canada is operating the boat he or she brought into Canada for less than 45 consecutive days."" That's all I need to know."
5676354,Shortline,2017-07-20 16:14:00,234,"How long has Canada required proof of boaters competency to be carried by boat operators? I was looking at boating regs because I had a question about laws for an upcoming trip we are doing(tomorrow). I see that all boaters are required to carry proof of competency? Is this relatively new? Or have I and everyone I make trips with been in violation on every trip we make? Serious.y, this is the first time I have ever heard of this requirement, and in literally dozens of game warden encounters over the last 30 yrs, I have never been asked about this? Have we/I just been extremely lucky?"
5676410,gullrockguy,2017-07-20 16:51:00,44,"we have had this boating certification for several years now, BUT,. here's the kicker, if you are an American visitor, you don't need one, and if you are staying at a tourist camp then the camp owner is supposed to insure that you know how to handle a boat. However, if your state requires a boater certificate, then that is valid here. hope this helps, if I were you i wouldn't wory about it if you are an American."
5676538,port1042,2017-07-20 18:20:00,509,"The camp I use required us to sit though a ""training session"" the first time we went up. Since then they just provide the documentation each year. They've been doing that for the past 5 years in our case. But they do provide documentation with advice to carry that with us at all times."
5676562,adempsey2.0,2017-07-20 18:29:00,612,"Unless you're planning on taking that 14' tinny into the ocean, the competency test is pretty useless anyway.When you rent, you just have to go through a checklist and that counts as competency. I haven't been asked about it in years now. Was just a cash grab."
5676602,bigwalleye1,2017-07-20 18:58:00,2632,"I think we've all seen boaters in Canada that could benefit from some training, especially that jackwagon guide in the Andersons camp boat that needs to learn about right of way last Monday. Anything would help."
5676666,Obabikon,2017-07-20 19:42:00,2370,"It's something like... less than 5 consecutive weeks in Canada, and you do not require one."
5677218,Limeyangler,2017-07-21 06:56:00,563,"This annoys me no end. I am not annoyed with our friends south of the border not requiring one, as there are plenty of bad drivers on both sides of the border, what annoys me is that it makes the whole Boaters card seem more and more pointless. I don't think it is a cash grab by the government as these things usually cost more to administrate than the revenue they generate, waste of my tax dollars? I remember taking the course, the question I failed on was something to do with beam width of a 40' sailboat.....even if I won the Lottery I would never buy or own a freakin sailboat!"
5677954,prov1800,2017-07-21 12:37:00,5010,The whole thing is a joke.

5678258,BornToFish,2017-07-21 14:45:00,1224,"Greetings,I understand that lodges offering ""boat safety training"" (i.e. the class and quiz) are regarded by the Canada Revenue Agency as being an ""eligible tour package"" since they offer an ""eligible service"" (i.e. something more than a cabin and boat). Other eligible services can include dockside boating safety and fish cleaning and freezing. This means that guests can seek reimbursement of a portion of the HST paid on their stay. That is, guests can get some of their money back from the government if they take the safety class at their lodge. This isn't the worse deal around.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
