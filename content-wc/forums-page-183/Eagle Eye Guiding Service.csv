Started the morning with over 20 slot walleyes with our limit of 8 walleyes in a few hours, Afternoon entailed Muskie fishing with about 9 follows but none in the boat, For a couple of older guys and their first time Muskie fishing it was a great experience. Definitely would recommend Greg for any Eagle Lake guiding."
