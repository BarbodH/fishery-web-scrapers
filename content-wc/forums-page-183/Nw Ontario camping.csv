5690394,fishpoop,2017-07-28 23:57:00,630,"I can't give any info, nor review them, but I happen to know that Red Wing Lodge and Mylie's Place Resort, Morson Ontario, Lake of The Woods, Sabaskong Bay has RV camping and rents boats."
5690674,Baseline,2017-07-29 06:51:00,3207,"Red Wing on LOW at Morson is a nice resort with great owners and good campground. The Morson area is s top LOW fishery for walleye, musky, crappie and SMB. Press Lake just north of Ignace is a good lake for walleye and has nice campground. Vic and Dots resort on LOW just north of Nestor Falls is another nice resort with new owners who are working hard to satisfy customers. It's on south Whitefish Bay and a good area for pike, SMB, LMB and lake trout. Separation Lake Camp and on the English River north of Kenora. Separation is very unusual because it's out in the middle of nowhere, but has a good access road and campsites with electric. It also has a modern shower house. The walleye fishing is superb. The western basin of Lac Suel has several resorts with campground. Check their websites. The Landings on Red Gut Bay of Rainy Lake has a nice campground and is a good place to take a late May trip for walleyes or mid-June for crappies and walleyes. These spots should keep you busy for a few years. I know a lot more that I've been to over the years including some remote camping areas not associated with resorts. PM me if you want some more info."
5690898,fishpoop,2017-07-29 08:53:00,630,"P.S. I have been to Red Wing Lodge many times. However, my last trip was 2003 and I don't know what changes have been made since. I stayed in a cabin during my trips and I didn't pay much attention to the camping layout they offered. I just know they have it. That's why I said I couldn't review them. It's a nice family run family resort. Quiet, clean, comfortable. It's not fancy. Just a good basic fish camp."
