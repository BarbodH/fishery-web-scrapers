We only trolled with cranks, but found a really good walleye bite in 13 to 20 FOW, nothing over 17"", mostly dinky walleyes/saugers with an occasional large pike thrown in the mix, a lot of fun, way better than getting skunked!! My son caught a 40"" musky on a Flicker Shad with his walleye gear. Fun watching him wrangle it into the boat! It sounded as if the larger walleyes had transitioned to Miles Bay. We tried 20 feet plus, along the edges of humps & reefs, and all around open water flats, nothing over 17. They were well scattered. Have fun up there, and good luck!!!"

We have a week planned where we will fish our way north from Sioux Narrows, through Yellow Girl, Sunset Channel, French Portage Narrows, and then working back east towards Miles Bay and ending in Obabikon. We are fortunate to have friends with cottages spaced around the lake to spend the evenings."

Like Redwood said, they were very scattered. Caught a 26"" on a 6"" Jake casted in the weeds in 3 fow. Most of them came from 13-17 fow. Saw 19 musky, boated 5 between 38"" and 46"" The 46 had his tail eaten right off to a stub. Should have been easily over 50"" And lost several more. Finally got to the point, when we marked a walleye when we were casting for musky, I would drop a jig behind the boat and pick him up. Lots of fish over all, few big eyes, great trip! Have fun, it should just get better."
