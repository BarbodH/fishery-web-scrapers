5682178,DaBirdman,2017-07-24 16:24:00,164,"If you're willing to pony up a little dough, the Thunderbird is awesome!!! We ate there on our way up a little over a week ago in the dining area. Beautiful view, incredible food, and plenty of drink types to satisfy anyone in the group. Been having our dinners there for years on our Friday stay in I'Falls. Love to walk out on the docks afterwards as well."
5684466,NP4ME,2017-07-25 22:48:00,378,Never been to the Thunderbird. What are the prices like?
5684610,camp chef,2017-07-26 06:45:00,915,"The menu with prices is on their website........Not cheap,but not out of line either."
5684994,NP4ME,2017-07-26 10:05:00,378,"Thanks, Camp Chef. Just got done taking a look at it. Probably a bit high for my budget, but definitely not out of line. Might have to give it a shot next year."
5692418,Aspencreek,2017-07-30 15:56:00,2911,"I have always asked myself this question of all you guys that drive all the way to I Falls to stay overnight and not cross the border on friday. Is it because of tradition? Because you enjoy sitting in line with all of your closest friends to cross on sat morning? Because you didn't realize that FF has some nice hotels too? Or because all of those hotels are booked already because you procrastinated? Just curious. I did that 1 time and never again, I make my reservation for next year online the week I confirm with the camp."
5692434,That Minnesota guy,2017-07-30 16:07:00,8293,Crossing the border is only a issue if you lay in bed to long.
5692610,DaBirdman,2017-07-30 17:35:00,164,"Exactly! That, and for us it's tradition. To us, there's just no place like eating at the Thunderbird. If you cross before 8:30am, it's only a 5-10 minute wait, maybe less. No big deal. Now, if there were a place to eat dinner as nice and as good as the Thunderbird in FF, we may consider it (but not likely). No need to fix what isn't broken."
5692762,Aspencreek,2017-07-30 19:47:00,2911,"Wow, Ok so things have changed. We were in line at about 8am and we were approx 1/2 mile from the corner to the bridge, watching the guys load chips to make OSB or whatever they were going to do with them. I'll still cross the border friday night. And BTW, there is a Bostons Pizza in the parking lot of the Super 8. Pretty good food and the beer is cold, and the waffles at the 8 in the morning is a nice treat."
5692978,btyreprich,2017-07-31 04:32:00,1067,"We have stayed on both sides of the border and prefer staying on the American side. More hotels on the US side and like the previous poster, I make our hotel reservation for the next year once we have confirmed our week at the camp More restaurants & stores on the US side as well. We do enjoy a few beers with dinner that Friday night but not so many as to have us cross the border later Saturday morning."
5680450,btyreprich,2017-07-23 15:40:00,1067,Heading up to Ear Falls a week from this Friday. Now we always overnight in IF and time our arrival so as to have dinner / beers there before calling it a night What are the favorite spots for dinner in that town? We ate at the Mexican restaurant last year and it was good. Pizza the y at before - just OK.
5680474,pjshorthorn,2017-07-23 15:52:00,5654,"If you haven't tried the Border Bar before, it is a classic ""joint"". Pizza was decent with a typical bar menu and the local social scene entertaining. Word to the wise.....many a fisherman has had a long ""self induced "" drive the next morning after staying for what they thought would be "" just"" a couple of beers at the Border Bar. Everyone has to try this place at least one time......just for the atmosphere alone. PjShorthorn"
5680490,That Minnesota guy,2017-07-23 15:58:00,8293,"Chocolate Moose on the south end of town right on 53. Good food, no beer or liquor. Hard to say if the Spot will be open or not. Thats in the center of town and serves the good stuff."
5680578,The tank,2017-07-23 17:26:00,340,I've had some really good food at the americ inn. Beer was cold. Border bar was average but fun times. (Pizza that is was average) geovinti Italian restaurant was good. About it for us. We usually eat and stay in the fort if we enter Canada their.
5680634,Camoclad,2017-07-23 18:55:00,628,"We have had ""just a couple"" at the BB on occasion!"
5680930,prov1900,2017-07-24 02:38:00,544,AmericInn prime rib sandwich is the stuff of dreams. Great atmosphere if you like a nice quiet meal. Beer is great!
5681042,camp chef,2017-07-24 06:41:00,915,"The Thunderbird.....right on Rainy,Great food great view."
5681138,Jakerides,2017-07-24 07:51:00,223,without a doubt Thunderbird is the best place to go. Bar food or supper club dining. Great service and selection. View of Rainy Lake and the Houseboats across the bay. Reasonable lodge rooms to stay overnight if you want.
5681362,camp chef,2017-07-24 09:46:00,915,x 2....We stay there as well the night before we cross the border.Everything a guy needs and even breakfast in the morning if so inclined.
5681922,SmallyNut,2017-07-24 14:41:00,11,"I second the Chocolate Moose, I don't drive by without stopping. Unless something changed recently they do serve beer."
