Was told by NISC(National Import Service Centre) that is was allowed from US as long as it's clean from soil and bugs, But another government site says NO.You know fresh fish, fresh sweet corn and a few brewski's"

For what it's worth, we have never been asked about corn at the border. The corn is still in the husk - not commercially packed - but free of dirt. Firs there was the potatoe ban - then the poultry ban - and now the sweet corn ban??? Yikes"
5684562,jimirjr,2017-07-26 06:13:00,1149,Want a REAL treat ? Snap Your husked ears in 1/2... Toss them into HOT OIL for about 2.5 - 3 mins... (350-375 Deg) You'll never boil corn again.. Especially good in oil that fish was fried in... Don't even need butter... just some S + P...
5684722,LOW1,2017-07-26 07:27:00,2828,"We have brought fresh corn across the border frequently without ever being asked about it.There is a farmers market in Emo on Saturdays and one in Kenora on Wednesday which should have it.You can also buy fresh cooler weather crops like snow peas much later in the summer than you can ""down south."" So load up."
5684906,515,2017-07-26 09:15:00,254,Fresh corn is just hitting the markets in southern ontario so odds are you won't find any fresh way up north yet.

5685338,pjshorthorn,2017-07-26 12:29:00,5654,Don't worry about the fresh fish thing. I've sent him my GPS coordinates on where we slayed the perch last month......just so you can get a little more fish cleaning practice in.... How is the goose poop control program going for you ? PjShorthorn
5685490,Golden Eagle,2017-07-26 14:03:00,2642,"Best sweet corn I've ever had was purchased on a farm, 8 miles before arriving at International Falls. Was on right side of road. Was available several years, but shut down when corn squeezings found their way to auto fuel tanks and price jumped. Man and woman selling corn were not the ones who grew it, as they didn't know what kind of corn they were selling.I grow some pretty good ambrosia in my back yard, but it doesn't match what I found near Internal Falls."
