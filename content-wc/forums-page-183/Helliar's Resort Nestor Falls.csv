Not saying you didn't have a bad experience and shouldn't have torched this place on the site. Over the years we have stayed in a few ""dumps"" - one was so bad that we left early. That has only happened once in 40 years. when we made the change to our current lodge, we stopped and talked to a few fisherman on the lake from that camp and asked them about the camp in question. We all know web sites and brochures can be deceiving. On the other hand, I have yet to be burned by a fellow fisherman when asking for advice. Thanks for sharing your experiences here. Sorry the trip was not enjoyable."
