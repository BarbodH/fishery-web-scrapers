Man what a nice camp, Manfred is a great host and definitely keeps you entertained. The dock hand Jordan is a good dude too which makes the trip even more enjoyable. I highly encourage anyone to check them out if looking into a trip to Dinorwic or the Goon. As for the fishing, we found it easy to catch walleye but man we had a hard time finding good sized ones. We spent a solid day and a half chasing walleyes and only got 3 keepers. Moved to all kinds of spots but mainly just picked up dinks. Saw a cluster of 7 boats on south Dinorwic so we figured they had found some good ones, but tried to find some other spots away from them. Worms were more productive than minnows for us. Also spend a good time muskie fishing and landed 7 between the two of us. One day my friend lost 4 himself in about a 2 hour window. Only issue we really had was finding the big ones, not sure we even saw one over 40 inches. Had action on double 8's, 10's, smaller twitch baits, and topwater.The pike fishing started off kind of slow, but really picked up by end of the week. We ended up catching 4 over 30 inches with a 36 caught by my friend being the biggest. Best lure BY FAR was a Blue Fox #6 white vibrax. My friend borrowed it out of my box and caught more pike on it than we could count. Took a day and traveled down to Minnehaha as well. We caught pretty much everything down there, except walleye. Pretty area and still worth the boat ride though. I did manage a 17 inch pig of a smallmouth when walleye fishing in the narrows there....big fish. Overall it was a great trip, and the weather cooperated for the most part outside of one day when it was really windy and some strong storms moved in."
