The owners are first class and very easy to get along with. The fishing is typically very good for walleyes, smallmouths, and muskies."

These are more like homes, not cabins with the exception of the ice house and out house for #2. (Ice house is very cool though) You are pretty much left alone after being dropped off and let in unless you need something. You are much closer to world class fishing than being in town in my humble opinion. I highly recommend them if you can get in."
