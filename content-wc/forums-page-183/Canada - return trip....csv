And, I screwed up when I bought my license and got the yearly version - so I do have a current license. I'm only about 350 miles from the camp - a very easy, relaxed, trip. My plan is to look at the weather a week or less before the date I would leave. If it's going to be nice, I'll call and book the cabin. I used to go up the third week of September. It was cold, windy, and rainy - a transition from summer to fall. Did I say it was cold, windy, and rainy? I think late August or early September might offer nicer weather. I'm still deciding to go or not - something about fall weather makes a person think of hunting. But I like fall fishing and am leaning toward going. I know how to fish this lake in the cold, windy, rainy, weather of later September. But I would really appreciate some late summer advice? Will the fish still be in their summer pattern? Do the fish transition (from summer to fall) with the weather? I know this is a really vague request. But any help would be appreciated. thanks"

I have been up as late as the 3rd week in Oct, tent camping, and it was very enjoyable, as was every other trip to the north woods. Even brought back the ice I brought from home! Fall is my favorite time to be up north. Most walleye caught have not been shallow, but some have (not much help here). If you are breathing, and opportunity knocks, go man!!!!!! Bill"
5686778,wmd,2017-07-27 08:20:00,388,"I have gone up over Labor Day and the week following many times. I believe the fish will be in their normal fall pattern, up on humps and reefs coming out of deep water. If the weather is abnormally warm that may change but I doubt it. When they are on the humps and reefs they are there for one reason and that is too feed. wmd"
5686802,LOW1,2017-07-27 08:28:00,2828,"The dates you mention are not really very late at all. I don't think that you will see much difference in where the fish are. And the weather will likely be not that different than what you can expect throughout the summer.My view might be different if you were going far north, but it does not sound like you are.Mid to late September is my favorite time to be there."
5688010,BornToFish,2017-07-27 18:53:00,1224,"Greetings,Mid-September is my favorite time of the season to be on lakes in NW Ontario. Granted, the weather can be the worst of the worse, and the best of the best, with both types of weather happening in the same day. One of the benefits of being on the lakes at this time of the year is there will likely be very few other boats on the water. Kids are back in school, while many fathers are sitting in their favorite tree waiting for the buck of their dreams.I fished one lake where the walleyes would be fairly deep in mid-September. By this I mean I was fishing rock humps, often in 30+ fow. I now fish another lake where the walleyes seem to be much shallower during the autumn, say 20 fow or so.One thing that I noticed in mid-August is that the temperature gradient in the lake was very well defined. The walleyes seemed to be at a particular depth, likely driven by their overall comfort (temperature, light, dissolved oxygen, etc.). The walleyes didn't stray much from their preferred depth, say +/- two feet of water.In mid-September, the preferred depth of the walleyes seemed to break down, possibly coinciding with the thermocline beginning to break down. It seemed that the range of their preferred depth was much wider, say +/- six to eight feet of water. I rationalized these observations as that broad range of water depths was essentially equivalent to the walleye. I might get them in 24 fow on a particular rock hump, and 32 fow a short while later on the same rock hump.One thing to keep in mind when fishing during September is that the day isshorter. One cause of this is simply less daylight. The other is that you can lose most of a morning to lake fog. A thick blanket of fog can develop over the lake when warm/humid air encounters cool lake water.Another factor that you may be surprised by will be the absence of weeds. Lush cabbage weed beds during mid-August may be completely gone by mid-September, or entirely replaced by coon-tail. The disappearance of weeds often pushes perch onto nearby rock structure. I frequently caught a nice limit of jumbo perch while fishing for walleyes on nearby deep water humps.All in all, mid-September is still my favorite time of the year to be on a good lake in the Canada Shield. I just dress warmly in layers and adjust to what the day brings me. All of my personal best fish were caught in mid-September on lakes in the Shield.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5690618,Baseline,2017-07-29 06:32:00,3207,"Mid September is a great time for a fishing trip. I take three camping trips in September to mid-October. Usually crisp mornings, breezy afternoons and cool nights. Bugs are not a problem and the fishing is great. Walleyes are usually glued on the reefs and major points. The pike are moving over the reef tops and back in the bullrushes and deep weed beds. Over the years we've had 60% great weather, but I've been though 5 days of torrential rain, days and days of 30 MPH winds, snow and temps so cold the water would freeze in the coolers. IMO the purpose of the trip is to experience the environment and enjoy the experience. If I tried to guess the weather I'd end up staying home. Rule of thumb is the closer to July 1 the better the weather subject to some major hiccups."
5691122,papadave,2017-07-29 12:58:00,151,Do it! Never miss a chance like this when you get one. You may just find that you prefer this time over your normal time. The fish are fattening up for the winter and they seem to come into the feeding areas in much larger concentrations. The catch-able walleye and smallmouth seem to run bigger too.
