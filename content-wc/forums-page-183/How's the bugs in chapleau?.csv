5683738,Shellback,2017-07-25 12:17:00,8083,"A little disappointing. Site had many pictures of walleye and pike but most were taken at other nearby lakes. Something I wasn't aware of at the time of booking. Was predominately a smallmouth bite on the lake. With those we did very well, but I didn't want to drive 2300 miles to catch smallmouth. Spike's Keg of Nails was great for dinner, and the elephant ears from the bakery were wonderful. Thanks for the tip. Overall a good trip, made it there and back safely with no mishaps. Did see a rolled over camper and a few miles later, a rolled over SUV on I-75 last Sat. Wet weather and people still had the hammer down."

5684378,Shellback,2017-07-25 20:22:00,8083,"I really enjoyed the camp and the people running it. I wouldn't consider it false advertising, as there were walleye and pike in the lake, just not in quantities . They did mention there was fishing in other local lakes available. I should have been more specific and asked more questions when booking. Most of the other lakes were accessed by carrying small boats in pick up beds with portable gas motors. My Alaskan 1600 has to be trailered. I blame myself for not asking more questions that could have prepared me better. The lodge owner would have set us up with a smaller boat and motor, but I'm 69 y/o and my brother is 74. A little more work than we were interested in. In reality, farther north west as you mentioned would have been a better choice. But that would turn it into a 3 day road trip each way. I'm 8.5 hours east of Toledo."
5684514,kzoofisher,2017-07-26 04:12:00,5144,"Sorry your trip wasn't what you hoped for. On the other hand, there is a market for lakes with good smallmouth, especially if the top water bite is dependable. It might behoove the owners of this lodge to do some advertising targeted at fly fishermen."
