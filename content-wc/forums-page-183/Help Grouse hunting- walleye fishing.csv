5679490,fsz,2017-07-22 19:43:00,144,"Did a combo trip last year near Jellicoe. Not sure what type of experience you are looking for. We use dogs and found birds but not in the numbers we expected. The birds were super tame and would not voluntarily flush. We use pointers flushers would work better. We still enjoyed ourselves. The MNR does not really do much as far as population surveys but might be able to point you in areas that have better habitat for ruffs which are better eating and more sporting than the spruces. Take outfitter reports on birds with a grain of salt most are geared to fishing. If lots birds are observed on anyone's regular travel routes, well you'll hear there are lots of birds. But that might not hold when beating the bush or walking trails."
5683402,Lake Wisconsin,2017-07-25 09:18:00,1960,"Similar experience 2 years ago. There were some birds, but using pointers wasn't that much fun to be honest. If they flushed from the dog, they would simply go up in a tree and look at you. Often you would need to throw something at them to make them fly. There were other hunters in our group that did good - but 100% road hunting, which isn't my cup of tea. Unless I hear of other experiences, I would not go back for grouse."

5691802,Golden Eagle,2017-07-30 07:16:00,2642,No need to hunt chickens. Take a walk and they'll volunteer themselves to you. Young kids get them with rocks and clubs.

5695514,Lake Wisconsin,2017-08-01 07:51:00,1960,"I am sure it did. And we had a crew. Around 30 dogs in camp. All staked out. Even had the local wolf population come in and check out the dogs. When I spoke to the camp owner of hunting grouse, he said they are all over the place. As the week went on, I saw what he meant - he would take what he called his buggy (Polaris Ranger), toss on about 100 miles of gravel driving and shoot the birds he saw on the road. They would not move. Not sporting to me, but sure would be a way to fill a freezer with grouse."
5695554,Golden Eagle,2017-08-01 08:20:00,2642,It's not hunting chickens.It's shooting chickens.
