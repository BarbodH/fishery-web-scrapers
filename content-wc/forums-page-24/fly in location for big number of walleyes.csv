6701419,fishin779,2022-12-15 03:59:00,63,I tell folks all the time.. Sometimes catching fish gets in the way of fishing...Canada is SO beautiful and I only get such a small time to be with family !!
6701479,grindstone,2022-12-15 09:05:00,201,"Moose Point Lodge. 20 plus consecutive June weeks (missed 2 Covid and airbase was flooded last year) for me my middle son and my group. The story I tell most often is that there are windows during the week where you can open your bail and not get a 1/4 oz jig to hit bottom in 13 FOW. Many mornings where my son and I can't get anything eater size meaning 17"" or smaller out of a 100 walleye. Great people have maintained their camp as catch and consume for about 18 years. Picture and net worthy fish for us start around 24-25"" I personally have never broken 30"" though a number in our group have. I've never broken 50"" for a northern having caught plenty of 48 & 49"" though others have. SM afternoons I always get my share over 20"" and the 18s and 19s will wear you out. Bear, moose and occasionally woodland caribou. https://moosepointlodge.com/"
6701511,Yellowfin123,2022-12-15 11:07:00,2182,"this sounds like the perfect lake since you can throw in some big smb on top of everything else, i'll be looking into this place thanks for sharing this.."
6701515,wdkott,2022-12-15 12:05:00,26,"Would like to know current rates at Moosepoint Lodge and Outposts as it appears website is old. Also, have you fished there in July, August, or September?"
6701517,Fisherman Ted,2022-12-15 12:15:00,461,Odd. The rates page is nearly 9 years old.
6701533,Cutting Edge Official,2022-12-15 14:09:00,242,"No, it would be a fish roughly every 4.5 minutes by your 6 days, 10 hours per day metric.Sorry guidedfishing....didn't notice pnnylfr cleared up the math....my bad!"
6700332,prov1800,2022-12-09 10:51:00,5010,not sure where you get your info from but there were way more people up here than you think.Every camp owner i know said last season was one of there best.Even for g my guiding was a amazing year.As far as looking for a deal on a flyout good luck.Most ate the extra fuel costs this summer at least i know Clarks did.So basically flying with them was already a deal.
6700342,Lac Seul John,2022-12-09 12:10:00,31,"I have no idea why I am jumping in on this one...but whatever....here it goes. I don't think these numbers are completely outside the realm of possibility. If you are a repeat customer with knowledge of the lake and spots....12 fish an hour over the course of a day is doable. It would be a freakin grind though. When we finally decided to stop exploring and fish known spots on the last day of our trip to Lac Seul this year, my son and I pulled 245 fish. That was on a day with 9 am start, 1.5 hour lunch, and about 2 hours of casting for bass (waste of time). So no doubt for me - if you are in a fly in, know what you are doing, and just want to fish and nothing else you can hit that number. I guess you would need consistent weather for the week also. Is that possible in Canada? I wish I knew 5 that fish like this. Sounds like fun."
6700352,prov1800,2022-12-09 12:43:00,5010,Very doable.Especially on a flyout.Know a group of guys from WI that come to Clarks on Cedar opener than sept also.All 6 are good experienced fisherman and know the lake.They count.lol.2400 hundred this spring and think 1600 this fall and they said that was 3 slow days in that week.lol.Thats a drive inn.Trust worthy guys.I have had some one fish per minute days myself.But that's to boring for me and got to move.lol.
6700358,walleyecheek,2022-12-09 13:35:00,2231,Kind of like fishing in a Bathtub.......LOL.
6701002,Lac Seul John,2022-12-13 06:57:00,31,"I believe it. I think I am done with the clicker. It hasn't happened yet, but I can see us trending towards measuring the success of our trip by the numbers of fish we catch. Need to instead focus on relaxing, enjoying the time and scenery, and exploring."
6701004,Lac Seul John,2022-12-13 06:59:00,31,Little bit. Became a bit mechanical. I think we had more fun on the days we spent exploring and trying different stuff. It was all good though!
6701008,prov1800,2022-12-13 07:15:00,5010,Your last sentence explains it all.Trying to catch 100-200 fish a day becomes a job.If some of those days are slow some guys are disappointed and seems to ruin there trip.
6701100,Walleye2242,2022-12-13 14:30:00,263,i have and never would use a clicker. my feeling are it insults the experience and love for fishing and catching fish. I would think the fishing gods would not like you looking at another creature as fishing poll to brag.
6701237,proguidedream,2022-12-14 07:33:00,345,"i lose interest around 50 walleye in 1/2 a day if they are all the same size. ive played the game of trying every lure and plastic bait in my tackle box, while the old dogs stick to a jig and minnow. that is tried and true method of catching fish, but you would be suprised at how these northen walleye react to some baits they have never seen. now dealing with a dozen walleye in 10 minutes with a flutter spoon and a treble hook or lipless crank with 2 trebles is definitly not as fun as just popping a jig out of thier lip."
6701301,MrSimon,2022-12-14 11:17:00,922,"Boreal Forest Outfitters in Nakina has plenty of lakes that will provide solitude, beauty, and as many walleye as you can catch ... with decent size too. We fished one of their lakes a few years back and you could easily sit and jig up 100 walleye in a day if you wanted. Maybe not every day for a week straight due to conditions and fish attitude, but you'll get that anywhere. As a side note, if you want big numbers you'll want a good graph with auto-mapping. It will make finding and staying on the spot-on-a-spot so much easier. A 15 yard move can make the difference between catching 2 fish per hour, or 20. Also, a drift-sock and/or anchor will greatly help too."
6674322,Old Timer,2022-07-21 15:10:00,255,"When searching out new lakes with lots of walleyes I look for good flow in, good flow out and tea-colored water. Then pick a lake of manageable size given your level of expertise. Many outfitters mentioned on this site have lakes with these characteristics. Then, if I had a choice, I'd pick mid-June followed by mid-September. Early in the season at an outpost lake you can park yourself at the nearest rapids and catch fish to your heart's content. With fewer people fishing Canada you might find an outfitter who won't charge you a premium for only having three guys, especially if you choose a fall date for your trip."
6674520,danvan18$,2022-07-22 08:08:00,67,Check with Lee at Pickerel Arm Camps. Been going there nearly 30 years and several great lakes with reasonable pricing.
6674636,Bstar,2022-07-22 14:48:00,564,I would recommend Slate Falls Outposts' Arc Lake camp. We were there last August and caught over 2400 fish in a week. Ryan will definitely take care of a 3 man group.
6700190,wallypod,2022-12-08 11:48:00,21,Bigtaproot - Not sure if you booked for 2023 yet but PM me and I can share some spots and maybe a prime slot next June.
6700222,walleyecheek,2022-12-08 15:37:00,2231,You need to go to Kapikik with Clark's. You'll catch double your 2400 amount.
6700256,Da' Walleye Assassun,2022-12-08 19:30:00,358,Triple the amount is more like it. Minnows have to be placed on jigs under your raincoat to prevent walleyes from attacking your bait.
6700262,lionfan19,2022-12-08 21:58:00,41,"Lots of walleye, wow take your pick, sounds like about every flyin I have ever been on."
6700268,RichA$1970,2022-12-08 23:30:00,1159,"Slate Falls Hooker Lake would be up there to consider along with great facilities for an outpost but pricey. I could care less about clickers and some idiots think a bite or hit should be a click, no wonder the thousands of fish reports"
6700286,prov1800,2022-12-09 07:03:00,5010,I hear you Rich.Who cares how many fish you catch.At flyouts you will catch lots.I can catch as many at the drive inns.I know many guys that use the clickers and they come up with huge numbers and get daily updates from them.I think these kinda guys are disappointed on days where fishing or weather slows it down.I normally bring 10 doz minnows so if we end up using them all could be 120 fish for that day for normally 3 people.I think that's a pretty good day for drive in camp.
6700308,walleyecheek,2022-12-09 08:09:00,2231,I suppose the gentleman and his 5 buddies that caught 5000 fish ! in a week would consider 1000 fish in a week a bad week ?
6674228,pnnylfr,2022-07-21 07:05:00,114,"With respect, I think you missed a step in the math process. 5000 fish divided by 6 days = 833+ fish per day 833 fish per day divided by 6 guys = 139/140 fish per guy per day 140 fish per day divided by 10 hours = 14 per hour Our outfitter we fly in on day one, out on day 8. 7 days to fish in our week. Which would equate to 12 (rounded) fish per hour."
6674230,Baseline,2022-07-21 07:10:00,3207,"Call Rusty Meyers Flying Service located in Fort Francis, On. and tell them what you want, They have a selection of lakes. They will drop you off on enough walleyes to make you happy. Ask for a lake with good populations of SMB and pike so you have something to fish for when you get bored with catching walleyes."
6674234,prov1800,2022-07-21 07:24:00,5010,"I've had oppurtunities to fish some of Clarks outposts and all though I havnt fished all of them (28) the ones I have fished all produced huge numbers with some up to 28 ""walleyes.Fishing was very eas√Ω and mainly shoreline type fishing.Which ever outpost you would go to would be awesome.All the cabins are very comfortable.Highly recommend them."
6674260,guidedfishing,2022-07-21 09:43:00,531,Thanks Pnnylfr for keeping me straight.
6674264,Old Timer,2022-07-21 10:05:00,255,"Okay, and if I'm following your math, each person in your crew averages about a fish every five minutes for seven days of fishing. Yeah, if you say so"
6674266,bellbuoy,2022-07-21 10:08:00,490,We fished the Bamaji Lake Main Camp with Knobby's in 2019 and again this month. Great numbers wise and size-wise.

6674284,Bigtaproot,2022-07-21 11:38:00,900,Many thanks to everyone for the suggestions
6674286,onetimedave,2022-07-21 11:39:00,502,Boreal Forest Outposts out of Nakina can fulfil your wants
6674290,adempsey2.0,2022-07-21 11:56:00,611,"Root Bay Camp as well. The outflow from Lake St. Joseph is teeming with Walleye. Actually, I think any of the SFO camps would be great. North Caribou Lake is another lake where the walleye were everywhere. Other recent trips where we caught plenty of walleye: Gray Woods Outfitters - Blackbirch Deep Wilderness Outposts - Studd I think you would do really well with many outfitters. Just pick a decent sized lake, one connected to a river system and/or with incoming rapids/falls. I can't think of any fly-in outposts where I did not catch plenty of walleye. 100+ per day/boat would be totally possible most of the time if that is something I wanted to do instead of chasing big pike. Going early season helps a lot. Although, fall can be great too."
6674080,Bigtaproot,2022-07-20 11:58:00,900,"We are 3 guys that look for large number of walleyes. Has anyone had a good experience on a fly in where you catch mainly walleyes in good numbers? If so, any suggestions would be appreciated. We are willing to pay the extra money for only having 3 guys"
6674084,Cgillespie,2022-07-20 12:16:00,120,"If you're looking for a full-service fly-in, Cat Island Lodge on Trout Lake, near Red Lake, was great for us in June. Caught hundreds of good sized ones."
6674088,Bigtaproot,2022-07-20 12:25:00,900,Thanks for the reply. Not looking for a full service plan as we enjoy the solitude
6674160,Bfgilly,2022-07-20 19:12:00,18,"You might consider Thunderhook fly-Ins, they have several excellent walleye lakes"
6674168,Bigtaproot,2022-07-20 19:44:00,900,"Thanks for the tip, I will do some research"
6674172,Spurgery,2022-07-20 19:58:00,79,"I went to cat island lodge a few years ago. It‚Äôs a clear water lake with walleye, pike, and lake trout. Caught all three species. Never caught any walleyes above 25‚Äù but caught high numbers of 18‚Äù-23‚Äù walleyes. There is also another lodge on the lake called sandy beach lodge."

6674204,Eagle1,2022-07-21 05:52:00,28,"I'd recommend going to Kapikik Lake with Clark's Resort & Outposts. Our group of 6 guys caught just under 5000 fish for the week, with all but 290 of them being walleyes. It's an awesome lake, with plenty of different places to fish and explore."
6674206,Bigtaproot,2022-07-21 06:07:00,900,"Wow, that is a lot of fish. Even using Minnesota guys algorithm that has a lot of fish"
6674216,guidedfishing,2022-07-21 06:21:00,531,"I will admit I have never done a fly in I like the comfort of my own boat. On my boat in or drive in trips I have never really counted fish maybe an hour at a time but never really keep track when you are either reeling fish in or re rigging what is not to like and really could not imagine catching fish any faster than I can reel them in. That being said 5000k fish or just under is an incredible number. For 6 guys each fishing a solid 10hrs each day for 6 days straight that means you were basically catching a fish less than every 5 sec's. for 10hrs straight each day. That is no exploring, no peeing, no eating. 6 guys reeling fish in as fast as they can."
