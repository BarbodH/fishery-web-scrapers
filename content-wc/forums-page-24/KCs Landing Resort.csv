6701140,Riverkeg,2022-12-13 16:53:00,134,Good to see Wayne enjoying some recreational activities. I only see him working when we’re at Northern Lights in May/June. 4 trips to that camp and I still haven’t met you. I appreciate your Cedar Lake reports though.
6701148,Eckohlt,2022-12-13 17:37:00,3685,"You own as much stuff as Wayne does,he has no choice but to work."
6701156,Riverkeg,2022-12-13 17:53:00,134,"No doubt, and the primary reason it was nice to see a pic of him otherwise."
6701164,prov1800,2022-12-13 18:39:00,5010,Thats amazing iam there a lot.lt me know when your there.ill come visit
6697684,prov1800,2022-11-23 18:13:00,5010,"Well I got out with Wayne at 3 today.We walked out to where the ice shacks normally would sit and Wayne cut 3 square holes with his battery powered chain saw.I grabbed a minnow and put it on my jig ,dropped it down and before Wayne cut third hole I had 2 eater walleyes up on the ice already.Talk about fast fishing.Ice looked to be around 8"".First ice can be some of the best ice fishing of the season.We both limited out in 5 min.Fished till 3:30 and caught walleyes steady.Fun to get out on the ice for the first time today and couldn't of asked for nicer weather at oc/32f and some nice sunshine.Nothing like some fresh fish for supper.They do have cabin rentals and ice shacks are within a easy 100 yd walk or can drive right to shacks on the plowed road.Check them out for a ice fishing trip to KCs Landing or the more adventurous snowmobile trip to Anishinabi Lake Lodge.www.clarksresorts.com"

6697778,MikeinMN,2022-11-24 16:22:00,190,"Good to see the quality fishing continues on Edward! I booked a trip to KC's this February and am quite looking forward to it. Any special jigs or jig colors work better there? I think I remember seeing you post about using hair jigs there in the past. Also, is there much of a night bite there? Gets dark pretty early in February."
6697786,prov1800,2022-11-24 17:46:00,5010,Be fun to meet up.No special jigs required.1/16 Oz to 1/8 Oz all that is needed.I made up some light hair jigs last year and at times worked better than a minnow.1/16 Oz with a brownish/orange mix hair I got off some of my old muskie pike lures.They did work great.Ill be making some more as this last summer I used them from the boat and had some muskie/pike eat them.lol.
6697916,prov1800,2022-11-25 18:53:00,5010,Enjoyed the fresh walleye from yesterday and my wife made a blueberry pie for dessert.Live is good in the Northwest.Weather +3c today and few more warm days coming.Got deer showing up in daytime so next week it's put some meat in the freezer.Sled deck in my truck and fired up sled today to in 4 pulls.Ready for the ice fishing season.
6697920,Eckohlt,2022-11-25 19:04:00,3685,I gave the top 2 pictures a second look! LoL
6697922,prov1800,2022-11-25 19:25:00,5010,You'll be eating that soon enough.Maybe get the wife to make a pie for you guys to.
