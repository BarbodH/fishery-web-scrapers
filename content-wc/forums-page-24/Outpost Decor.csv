6699478,MikeinMN,2022-12-04 19:47:00,190,"The very first Canadian outpost cabin I stayed in had propane lights, propane fridge, and a fireplace for heat. I bet ten million mosquito coils got burned in there too. It was old when I was there 30 years ago. The walls were plywood and covered with soot and all sorts of quotes, fish reports, wildlife sightings, weather events, card game outcomes, names and hometowns of groups of visiting fishermen and hunters, and plain old general nonsense mostly written in pencil or sharpie marker. We did add some general nonsense during our stays, as it was obvious that this had started before we were even born. Heard that cabin was redone in the 90's and has nice knotty pine walls now. Would love to have a piece of one of those old walls framed on my cabin wall. There were also more than a few jigs and spoons with wire leaders hung here and there in the rafters. We never knew if theses were retired like star players jerseys hung n a stadium, or suggestions on what to use while fishing there. We never left or took any of those. Wonder where they went when the place got remodeled? Also, love those watercolors!! That pike painting is greatness!"
6699184,NM_Trout,2022-12-03 08:53:00,1094,"I saw in another thread that a camp owner got pretty upset with someone for writing on the wall of their cabin. I'd say rightfully so. But I enjoy the non-destructive notes and art left behind by previous users of the cabin(s). I always read the logbook of charts to check on fishing spots, and I like seeing the new notes in that book, and also seeing eclectic ""decorations"" left behind. My first trip to an outpost was 2003, with my brother. We thought that the cabin was great. Inside, there were lots of decorations going back decades. Broken paddles hung from the ceiling, pieces of bark with chewed up lures decorating them, mostly wood and paper scraps, and a busted rod tip or two ala-crossed-swords in repose. All of them had names and dates and significant events... number of fish, notable big fish, etc. (Sort of a ""Possum Lodge"" decor) Many of those names were likely from folks who are no longer with us. I thought it was pretty cool to look at that history of the camp as recorded by the users. One large chunk of wood was amusing. There was a group of ladies that visited a few times, and a group of guys at other times. They had an ongoing dialog and good natured ribbing between the two parties. It was over the course of about 6 years. Slightly flirtatious, but only silly and not offensive at all. Overall, the cabin had a sort of ""club"" feel to it. You sort of got this community-spirit sort of feel with the others who enjoyed this same lake over the past many years. The outfitter told me that somewhere around 2011-ish, a man / woman couple stayed at the camp and they didn't like the ""art"" and decided to burn all of it. The owner was not happy that this couple took it upon themselves to clean things up. Since then, some cabin art is slowly reappearing. This is the camp that I take my daughter to, and each trip she does water colors using water from the lake. She has left a couple of these on the wall in the cabin. She also has painted an on-site picture to give as a gift to the camp owner. I noted that other small things are beginning to appear as well.Got any weird-decoration stories about your camps?"

6699228,walleyecheek,2022-12-03 15:50:00,2231,They weren't like these wer they ?
6699326,kim n indiana,2022-12-04 04:48:00,62,yep.
6699338,Juls,2022-12-04 05:54:00,13414,"Unbelievable! I would have been furious with them! And, charged them a huge sum for their decision to destroy my property, and memories. If they didn't like it, they could have just said something, and maybe got a discount, or given the owner a chance to remove it, until their snobby asses left the camp. What kind of person does that???"
6699356,Hook_settr,2022-12-04 07:22:00,127,"Went to my first outpost with my dad in 1996. I don't recall much for decorations but there was plenty of ""notes"" on the walls that we enjoyed. It was kind of like a pre-cursor to Walleye Central! I think our favorites were the group that kept track with tick marks of all the mice they killed (a lot) and the note saying ""the yellow MNR plane really does stop and check you sometimes""."
6699406,maddogg,2022-12-04 10:33:00,178,A number of outposts I fished at had odes to former members of their party who spent many years fishing with the gang. That kind of hit me as a nice thing to do.
6699420,NM_Trout,2022-12-04 13:07:00,1094,"I'm pretty sure I had a surprised ""WTH"" look on my face when the outfitter told me what happened. He then told me that they would never be allowed back. So... we have continued the decorating tradition a bit. She has put up these war-board decorations. I would laugh, because she insisted on going to the dock to get water, even thought the water out of the sink faucet was also straight lake water :-) I love fishing with kids. Tell you what... Do you visit this camp? First person who PMs me a picture that they have taken of these watercolors, I will send a half dozen of my hand tied 6/0 pike flies."
6699428,Eckohlt,2022-12-04 13:42:00,3685,"Doesn't get any better than that,my hats off to her!"
6699436,kasmere,2022-12-04 15:16:00,20,What a fun interesting thread. My brothers and I love the the history of our previous fishermen. The watercolors are amazing however the cabin is a mystery to me. Can't wait until this is identified!!
