Could anyone share some info on this lake and camp? - hazards, tactics, pointers etc. We're looking for some big gators and if its like the big lake, we should catch plenty of eyes in the process. Thanks!"
6701477,bthomas3333,2022-12-15 09:05:00,465,Cool! Make sure you post a trip report after. That one is on the list to check out someday.Brett

Our best spots were western bigger bay with creek going in, the mouth of the river going to Pelletier, and throughout the river going to Pelletier. Definitely some big fish here. Our biggest of the trip was 46.5"". If you talk with Jerry he'll tell you that they've gotten some giants right off the rocks in front of the cabana. Walleye were all the way up the river for us as well. Hope this helps."

If anyone else has any info or suggestions for Campbell Lake outpost please reply or send me a PM. Thanks. On another note- I was thinking of bringing my fly rod up. i imagine that most of the pike will be in the cabbage. Anyone have success fly fishing for pike above the weeds? I plan to use big musky sized flies that only go down a couple feet. Should I use a sinking head to get them down more?"
6702413,bthomas3333,2022-12-20 09:46:00,465,I messed around in heavy cabbage in Alaska. It was an bABSOLUTE BLAST. Every hit was really cool. There are also a lot of water you can fish and the only way to access it is with flies. On those big muskie size flies I had a beed head that was maybe 1/8-1/4 ounce. The only other lure that could fish that deep in the weeds that could be fished on spinning gear are those Barney spoons.I would guess by later July the water might be too warm for the big girls in the weeds. I would still go in there for the thrill of seeing the strikes. I can fun on flies and Barneys whether they are 20 inches or 40 inches.
6702421,spoonchucker,2022-12-20 10:55:00,82,My son almost entirely fishes for pike with his fly rod. Here is an article he wrote.https://www.onthewater.com/saskatchewan-pike-on-the-fly Last year on cree we went in to a bay and he caught 20 on the fly including several over forty- all in mid July ( while I caught only one in the same bay using the traditional spoon.
