6699010,Eckohlt,2022-12-02 07:12:00,3685,Ya I think for the most part decorating outpost walls with ink is a thing of the past.Many have a booklet you get can get your writing fix done in.
6699026,RichA$1970,2022-12-02 07:54:00,1159,Driftwood and a Sharpie is what I left as a memento in an outhouse for my groupâ€™s fearless leader.

6699036,danvan18$,2022-12-02 08:12:00,67,"I have been using PAC since 1995, all outpost fishing, but would highly recommend. Been dealing with Lee since our first year and have no complaints. The cabins at the main lodge for fishing at Minnitaki always seem full in June."
6699074,rockape,2022-12-02 10:46:00,215,"I have fished Minnitaki for 20+ years. Never stayed at Pickerel Arm though. I stay around Sioux Lookout. I don't target lake trout, but a few years back in June, we were fishing some of those deep water humps not too far from the Chutes. Fishing walleyes (we caught several 25""+ ones too on the humps), but there was another boat nearby and it seemed like they were bringing in a big fish. Saw them land it and this laker had to have been close to 30 pounds. And then they caught another maybe 30 minutes later. I've caught plenty of 20lb+ lakers out of Lake Michigan, and these were big ones. They are there for sure. My biggest pike is from Minnitaki at 45.5. My friend has 2 46 inchers from Minnitaki too. GREAT lake. No muskies though. I hear they are in there, but I guess they are few and far between. That is what the legend Dick Pearson told me anyway. Lots of great smallmouth fishing too."
6699082,prov1800,2022-12-02 12:01:00,5010,"I didn't get to fish Minitaki last year as my wife retired from her job there.But fished it many times as I would bring my boat up and stayed on the lake on Abram.Minitaki has huge trout and very few small ones.Teason for that is the waters in Minitaki,Abram and down river into Lac Suel have have smelt which eat the the trout eggs when they spawn in the fall.I have friends that will catch some huge 40 lb fish.Not fast fishing but well worth it if you have the patience and willing to learn the lake.And yes Big V is loaded with lakers and very easy to catch.But most seem to always be in the slot.Big V is also very good for muskies.Pike can get huge in that system which is English River system.There are some muskies there as well as I have caught them casting for pike but not many.Pelican lake is also good waters for pike and there are a few more muskies in there as well."

6699126,Eckohlt,2022-12-02 19:32:00,3685,"Hope they got gloves on when there rolling,I never wrote on walls so my hands are clean,but next Thursday there going to smell like eye."
6698766,NM_Trout,2022-11-30 18:17:00,1094,"Who has fished Minnitaki lately, specifically using Pickerel Arm Camp? I'm looking for drive in resort options, and this looks likely. How is the management? More importantly, how is the fishing? Looks like lake trout, smallmouth, walleye and pike. Is the trout fishing decent?"
6698802,eyecatcher1,2022-12-01 06:47:00,323,"I fished Minnitaki one day early September this year, but stayed at a different resort. The walleye fishing was very good. As far as lake trout goes I think that Big Vermillion is much better."
6698808,RichA$1970,2022-12-01 07:25:00,1159,Eck must be ice fishing as I believe he goes there a lot and can probably tell you more about it. Looks like a good place based off their website.
6698834,Eckohlt,2022-12-01 08:09:00,3685,"Nope never fished minnitaki,but did fly out of there this year 3 times,the place was a zoo in June when I was there for fly out,mid summer I was back it was pretty quite there,so I can't help with any fishing details on the lake."
6698890,MN_Moose,2022-12-01 12:33:00,964,"I fished Minnitaki and stayed at Pickerel Arm Camp 20 years ago. I think the kids of the same family now run it. It is the only camp I will never return to. But as they say, your mileage may vary."
6698904,NM_Trout,2022-12-01 13:33:00,1094,Do you mind sharing why you didn't like it? Poor fishing? Facilities lacking? Feel free to PM if more comfortable doing so.
6698916,7 Mag,2022-12-01 14:09:00,1887,You might consider Cliff Lake or Eagle Lake if Pickeral Arm doesn't work out for you.
6698930,Eckohlt,2022-12-01 14:35:00,3685,"Lee the son owns it now,Moose did you have a run in with his dad when he had it??he really got angry when people wrote on his outposts walls!!"
6698974,prov1900,2022-12-01 17:33:00,544,"We stayed at Donnelley's for about 13 years in a row, making spring and fall trips. Lake Trout fishing can be excellent if you are there early enough. Legitimately never caught 1 under 10 pounds. 20 was our biggest. My top three pike are from there, along with my best walleye and smallmouth (and trout). Donnelley's is further down the arm, closer to what I would call way better fishing, although the camp you refer to isn't horribly far away."
6698996,Skywagon,2022-12-02 05:29:00,1106,"I don't blame his dad I would be ticked off too, those people would never be allowed back. I suspect the rising cost of spending a week at an outpost cabin has probably about weeded out the class of people that would be writing on and carving up cabin walls."
