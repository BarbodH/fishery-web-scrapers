6701020,rosh1,2022-12-13 08:27:00,275,"Pro, My son and I just made a quick wolf hunt trip. It was a little cold! Will be back up ice fishing but no dates set."

6701150,Eckohlt,2022-12-13 17:39:00,3685,"It ain't easy being a hunter.lol,warmer in the ice shack,with great rewards."
6701154,prov1800,2022-12-13 17:42:00,5010,Was pretty warm in blind have a heater which I turned to pilot on and off.
6701399,Skywagon,2022-12-14 20:07:00,1106,"Went to the Twin Cities yesterday, got home tonight. Both 35 and 502 were snow covered and crappy on the way back, not much difference between the two highways with todays snowfall, both were being plowed."
6701401,prov1800,2022-12-14 20:10:00,5010,Glad to hear you had a safe trip home.
6700660,ChadStock,2022-12-11 12:56:00,10,Been down 502 many times in the summer so I know the road well but looking to try ice fishing for the first time and I'm wondering how well 502 is maintained in winter?
6700664,prov1800,2022-12-11 13:08:00,5010,It gets plowed.Ok to drive on but there's times you just have to slow down that's all.Hardly ever have any accidents on that stretch.
6700762,btyreprich,2022-12-12 04:17:00,1067,I won't like 502 so much that I won't drive on it in August for our trip to Ear Falls. Hard to imagine what that road is like in the winter!
6700788,prov1800,2022-12-12 06:25:00,5010,It's a beautifull drive summer and winter.I don't understand what you think the problem is.Totally safe drive.Been driving it for 40 yrs.Road is in good shape in my opinion but I lice here and as far as roads go here none are in the shape of yours in the US.Winter driving you just have to use some common sense and have decent tires on.We will be using it shortly in January to get to a All Canada sports how.
6700798,prov1800,2022-12-12 07:06:00,5010,"Wayne Clark just texted me and said hwy 502 is all good.Saw 2 moose on there way home last night coming home from a ice show in Duluth,MN."
6700826,btyreprich,2022-12-12 09:07:00,1067,"It is a beautiful drive but I have seen people driving on 502 that reminds me of the Mel Gibson movie ""The Road Warrior"". For us, it's worth the extra 30 minutes on Highway 17 up to Kenora. Just our opinion - do what's good for you."
6700854,prov1800,2022-12-12 12:27:00,5010,I'd rather take 502 than hwy 17 anyday especially in winter.To many accidents last few years on daily basis with the truckers.
6700864,rosh1,2022-12-12 13:01:00,275,"Drove 502 last Friday, just normal winter driving condition. Save driving like Mel when no snow on the road."
6700870,prov1800,2022-12-12 13:13:00,5010,Should of let me know you where up.id visit.
6700872,JAY221,2022-12-12 13:20:00,877,"They do a great job of fixing the washouts in the spring so good that I can't imagine them not taking care of it in the winter. They know it is the lifeblood of the region. Later, Jay"
