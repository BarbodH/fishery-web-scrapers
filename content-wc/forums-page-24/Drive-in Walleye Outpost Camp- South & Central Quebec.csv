Just looking for recommendations for drive-in outpost camp on private ZEC lake for Walleye. Except for places near the Ontario border, I have found very few outfitters/lodges with any English on their websites. And yes, I do know to look for a link/button to click to see the English version of their website. I understand that French is their native language and have no problem with that. I just can't read French at all. I took Spanish in high school. I'm going to try to roughly define my preferred area by places easily seen on Google Maps: SW limit: Réserve faunique La Vérendrye NW limit: Matagami NE limit: Lac Pipmuacan SE limit: Lac Onatchiway Thank you!"

We had great trips for walleye, pike and lake trout which required a long boat ride for the trout. Their cabins are good. There's a mix of French Canadians and fishermen from the states. English is freely spoken by the camp owner. What took us away from Deerhorn on the huge Cabonga reservoir was their practice of drawing down the reservoir in dry summers. Areas of prime pike fishing were ruined. Walleye fishing was diminished. I keep an eye on their website because of the great fishing we had back in the day. From facebook it looks like the walleye fishing is strong once more. The area is beautiful. We saw many moose, bears and eagles on our trips and the camp is well run. Give them a look."

6700830,vteye3,2022-12-12 09:48:00,496,"We tried Gouin about 5 trips and couple other lakes 2-3 trips. Fishing was going downhill and noticeable increased development. I ruined a boat on Lac Albanel but will go back with your boat? Gouin/Albanel/Quebec is beautiful and worthy of consideration if an East coast guy. We made the commitment to ""try"" Ontario north of Lake Superior along with the 18-20 hour drive. 5 trips later no one in group looks back. I carefully researched and always get a good week with our outfitter although we go every other year. Ontario makes a 7 day trip a full 9 days for us NE guys but the fishing is worth it. Good luck lots of great fishing in Canada especially if you are flying into a lake with a big river flowing through the fishery."
