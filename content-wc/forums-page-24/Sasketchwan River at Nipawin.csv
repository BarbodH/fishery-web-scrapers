Out of 4 days we had one good afternoon and evening and where we got em on cranks. Fished until 1 hour after sunset. Been fishing there since the 90s when there were a lot more fish. Seems the window for great fishing is smaller now. I've never been there this late and was pretty optimistic there would be a lot of fish in the river and great fishing. The 3rd day there was one other boat on the river. The last day we had it all to ourselves."

Most of the walleyes hadn't entered the river yet since the flow was so slow to get the shinners moving and whitefish spawning. My uncle lives there and has been having luck in the big lake, but now is started to freeze."
6696116,vetleap,2022-11-10 15:45:00,539,I've fished the river since the 90s but I have never fished the lake. A little intimidation factor I think. I fish the Missouri river where I live and this is a very intimidating place with sandbars and submerged logs. Doesn't bother me in the least as there's current that helps identify slightly submerged logs. But I've fished it since the 80s. If there are submerged logs in the lake and not having any current to identify them could really ruin a vacation. Can you shed light on the log factor in the lake? Also curious as what depths the fish are out there in October..
6698708,whytie,2022-11-30 13:46:00,50,"Sorry for the late reply, the walleyes in the main lake still relate close to the old river channel in October. It's best to drive around the breakline from 15-25ft to find them. There are a few sunken island that are 15-25ft deep dropping off into 40-60ft. fish the edge of those drops jigging the use the sunken islands as feeding areas in the early mornings and evenings. the logs are not too bad as a majority have stared to break off and sink. If you fall the old river channels you'll be fine. The south 3/4 of the main lake is shallow and great for pike if you can find the old creek beds. This map is pretty accurate in terms of good spots.http://www.rustyhooktobin.com/images...n_Lake_Map.pdf"
6698722,vetleap,2022-11-30 15:13:00,539,Thanks for the reply. Good info and really would like to try it some day. Does anyone sell a chip with the lake mapped on it?
6698926,whytie,2022-12-01 14:31:00,50,Depends on what unit you have. There isn't a full lake chip but shared maps on humminbird and lowrance are pretty good. I have lowrance and use c-map for my maps.
6698966,vetleap,2022-12-01 16:32:00,539,Aaah yes I'll have to look into that. I have HB. Thanks for that.

The road at that time was not paved, and subject to periodic washouts. I was lucky enough to earn a Master Angler Award for a 4lb, 2oz rainbow, out of Piprell Lake. The wilderness along this road north was simply enchanting! Bill"
