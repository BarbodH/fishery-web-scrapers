6698522,BankerFish,2022-11-29 15:23:00,27,"Gotcha, I agree the facilities are nice and it's a great family operation! We stayed at the main camp, had fun watching the kids catch the same fish ""Ike the Pike"" multiple times from shore. It was almost like they were using a 5 of diamonds to play fetch with a pet fish, HAHA!"
6699040,danvan18$,2022-12-02 08:30:00,67,Yes I have seen a video of that Pike- very entertaining. I miss some of the lakes and the drive up the tunnel to Clamshell lake was always an adventure. Darrell could clean a fish in about 20 seconds.
6699172,GWC,2022-12-03 08:30:00,1021,We use the same resort year after year. The owners are great & the fishing has really good. That resort is Poplar Point on Gull Rock Lake
6699196,Pooch,2022-12-03 09:53:00,4618,"We initially changed lakes every year, then slowly figured out what we liked and now tend to fish just two. Both are large waters with above average size walleye, one has has nice smallies as a bonus. Lakers in one is also a change of pace bonus. Takes a few years to get the feel and rhythm of a lake. Pooch"
6699486,drlee,2022-12-04 20:51:00,409,"Started fishing northern Ontario in 1986. Been there annually. I have fished over 30 lakes. Moved around a lot to various camps, from fly in, drive in, boat in all included. The last 20 years I have narrowed my trips to two lakes. I will fish both of them for a month over the summer until they bury me in the back yard. I know the lakes. Both are first class fishing. Both are pure wilderness experiences. I have my own boat fully outfitted, which is a big deal. I can get around on the lakes easily since I have fished them for so long. One lake is 20,000 acres, the other 10,000 acres. 1 camp on each lake with only 7 cabins. Both surrounded by First Nation land, so NO private cottages. I will be glad to give you full info on both lakes. Let me know. Press Lake Camp and Austin's Wilderness Lodge can be googled. ( I have NO ties to these lakes, other than my love for both of them)"
6699562,fsck100,2022-12-05 09:00:00,10,"My family went to Camps Bay Cottages & Marina on Big Gull Lake for two weeks every summer growing up. Great memories. The owners at that time, Ken and Doreen Black were wonderful. Haven't been back to Canada in decades but I'm now planning a trip to QC. Probably going to Moose Territory Lodge (nearest town is Rapides des Joachims aka Swisha). It's on Lac Marion. Not sure though. One of the other guys is doing his own search. Looking forward to a remote outpost trip for the first time. Can't wait."
6696188,Ira,2022-11-11 11:31:00,6,"Our crew started our annual trip to Canada in 2015. For the first 4 trips, we were on the same lake but at different cabins (all run by the same outfitter). The last year there, one of our group brought his own boat, which was great, except for the last 60 miles in on the bush road. So in 2020 we decided to go to Alwaki on Lake Kipawa - easier on the trailer & boat. However, we all know what happened in 2020. So we found a place on Oneida Lake. We were able to return to Canada in 2021, so we booked a place there for September, and also returned there in July of this year. Plans for next year will be a new outfitter on Kipawa, as Alwaki is sadly being sold. New lakes are fun, but there is a learning curve to deal with - finding spots where the fish are can be a challenge, as we all know. Returns trip are nice due to familiarity with the outfitter and the lake, and we remember spots that were productive the past years."
6696364,eyecatcher1,2022-11-12 15:12:00,323,We've been going to Sioux Lookout for 30 years now. We usually go 2 or 3 times every year. We are now on the fourth different resort. We have changed over the years for different reasons and love where we are now.
6696490,NM_Trout,2022-11-13 11:48:00,1094,"Same outfitter for me, and I have been to three of their lakes and have settled on a favorite lake for return trips. Too much at risk to get a crappy trip; we trust our outfitter and the fishing is always fantastic."
6696548,btyreprich,2022-11-14 06:23:00,1067,"When the guys in our group were first married / before kids, two trips a year was the norm. First trip was to the lodge we had been staying at for several years. Second trip was to a new location. As time goes on, the trips went down to once a year and our thoughts were to go back to the lodge / lake we knew well. Didn't want gamble on a new location or take too many days to learn a new lake. The group is down to just two guys now and in 2024 both of us will be on Medicare and be able to work part time. Depending on the economy, our goal is to fish Canada twice each year. Same approach when we first started going to Canada in like 1977."
6696592,northernbite,2022-11-14 11:36:00,1186,On the move from Lake to lake. We have truck camper so just like Gipses. LOL Paul
6696792,MrSimon,2022-11-16 08:17:00,922,"Canada - never been to the same place twice (except as a kid with Grandpa). US Lakes - Like to go to Black Lake and the St. Lawrence in NY every year and stay at the same place. It's about the family tradition first and the fishing second. US Trout - drive and fly all over the country to fish different rivers and streams. Sometimes the same place twice, but man I love the ""what's around the next bend"" feeling."
6696828,nitroman,2022-11-16 13:48:00,368,"Same lake, same camp like it, love it, know it, there are fish in it. 22 years. Maybe at 40 years I will try a new lake lol! Or if ours sells and the new owners suck."

Ghost River- 4 years Pickerel Arm Camps- since 1995- Keike, Otatakan, Wapesi, Wapesi River, Little Miniss. Hope to get to Fawcett, Blackstone and Kabi All enjoyable (except first fly in) but sticking with PAC for 2023"
6698446,BankerFish,2022-11-29 10:00:00,27,"How was the trip to Ghost River? Been there 2x and it was slightly unpleasant...but that was the company i was keeping at the time...not the fishery. Have thought about giving it another shot with a different group, but we started turning left at Dryden for the past several years and been hitting good lakes so never really acted on it. just curious..."
6698470,danvan18$,2022-11-29 11:14:00,67,"It's been quite awhile since I was there but really enjoyed my trips there, nice people and they will take care of you. We actually stayed at the Sturgeon Lake cabins with Darrell- he's was awesome. I believe he is the head man now taking over from his parents. Quite the variety of lakes including the ones you could portage to- we did all but Zarn if I remember correctly. The only thing we didn't like was the long drives to locations and having to take gas with us."
6695852,FinmanPoozie,2022-11-08 07:56:00,696,"All in NY:Lake George 2 weeks every July: Same resort. Like the lake, the owner & all the touristy stuff there is to do. Kids are mid-teens now so much of our time is on the boat when the weather cooperates. It's a family vaca then (me with wet lines every morning, then family stuff the rest of the day). The lake makes bass & laker fishing look easy. Had to change from 1 resort to another in 2021 though because rates skyrocketed. ($80/day for dock space in 2021 @the original resort!!!)Black Lake: May & late Sept/early Oct. It makes pike & bass fishing look pretty easy also. I move between 3 resorts depending on what's available & who's also going. Most of these trips I'm going solo, so having a launch on site helps quite a bit...Might drop 1 'cuz i fell thru his dock this year & the owner could not possibly have been less concerned when I let him know about it (I wasn't hurt & never hit the water...but still, falling thru a resort's dock? Just sucks overall)Chautauqua Lake: Going to try to add that to my 2023 list for targeting musky only & see how that goes. Not a clue yet where to stay or dock or even if docking is possible yet.(I love to fish, but suck at it)Happy fishing!!"
6695868,maddogg,2022-11-08 09:08:00,178,"I've fished many lakes and quite a few numerous times.Only had one I wish I would have never gone to. It's no longer in business, I wonder why?"
6695870,law57,2022-11-08 09:14:00,1147,"I go to the same place - now twice each year, June and August. The fishing is really good and this lake has a lot of soft bottom. Crystal clear water but soft bottom - there is some shield rock too. I started fishing this lake 40 years ago - before highway 502 was built from Ft Francis to Dryden. We had a 14ft Lund boat and a Green Box Lowrance. I started to tie big (#5) spinners and put full length crawlers behind them. That turned the trick - bigger fish. I've caught big fish on very small minnows. But the biggest fish came on big bait. My father and I boated 13 walleye 30+ inches over the 6 years he fished with me. He died in 2000. Obviously we had better boats and equipment as the years went on. It was always a thought to move, but difficult to do with the results we saw. Besides the bigger fish, there has been countless fish in the 21-29 class. And always plenty of fish to eat - twice each day! Next summer I'll be 75yo. All my friends are dead or crippled and too old to go with me. I have some 'elder issues', but I feel good and have no trouble making the trip alone. Landing the boat at a wind blown dock - or getting into the boat and launching from a wind blown dock are difficult now - strength and balance... But the seasonal help is always running to assist me - can you say good tipper? The resort finds weeks for me to visit - empty cabin for 1. He and his wife are a big help to me too. Old friends now - and I still tip them well. It's money well spent - especially at my age. I have a nice Lund Alaskan with 50hp Yamaha tiller and Vantage trolling motor. Everything is at hand for me to fish. It will be a sad day when I can't go any longer."
6695882,floorguynate,2022-11-08 10:31:00,22,"Little bit of both. If the experience is good we rebook, if we want to look for something better we move on. Typically we aren't after high class accommodations, just a comfy bed and good fishing. Found a spot last year with full size appliances and what should be good musky fishing. I think we will be staying there for a few years to try and learn the lake a little better. Can only do so much in 6 days"
6695912,jambi,2022-11-08 12:54:00,504,"Little bit of both for me also, enjoyed all of these trips over the years.

6695998,BankerFish,2022-11-09 13:09:00,27,"On the average, I usually can only get away and go north for 1 week per year in the spring. Typically we go to the same cabin on the same island that I've been going to since I was 14yo. for reasons already mentioned...known rocks...known honey holes...nostalgia...and it's priced right. Rebook for the next trip while paying the bill for this trip. I hope to stay in that cabin annually until there's no longer a cabin there. But, if there's an upside that came out of the 'rona situation its that I've been able to take a second trip each year to new waters. When the border opened in Aug '21 I was able to jump in with a group that had a last minute opening. Then this year there was a some carryover vacation time that didn't get used during the shutdown, and the vaca savings account was a little fatter cuz it didn't get spent during the shutdown...so that equated to a second trip this year. Now that life's back to the normal busyness I'll prob. only get to take one trip back to the same island per year for the next several, but I've got something to look forward to and places revisit if and when life ever slows down."
6696000,nitroman,2022-11-09 13:13:00,368,"Same lake, same resort for 20 years now. Sometimes we try a different cabin while we are there!"
6696090,guidedfishing,2022-11-10 10:48:00,531,"I usually go a minimum of two one week periods, often adding in a long weekend a couple times a year on top of it. Usually in June I go to the same chain of lakes, its kind of like comfort food, and there is always something we try just a little different or explore on the same lake a little more but otherwise over 20 years there is something to be said for knowing most every rock, reef, and hump and be able to quickly make wise decisions. Typically the August trip is our explore time. We have been going to the same Camp for well over 15 years but we always try and hit a different lake or on the very large lake we are on we also cut our teeth on new water. Some lakes we go back to.. Others just get checked off the list for reference. I think there are cases to be made for really understanding the water you are on, and for venturing out and capitalizing on potentially new opportunities. good luck"
6696148,kettyspanky,2022-11-11 03:56:00,271,"We have been doing the same lake for 8 years now. We have tried a couple different resorts but have found the one we really like now. It's fun fishing the same lake because it's somewhat different every year. Depending on water depth and weed growth. We try to do the same week every year if possible. 2021 we couldn't because of the border issues, but went the first weekend it was open and did great. Hopefully we can start doing 2 trips a year and can branch out for the second trip."
6695644,RichA$1970,2022-11-06 19:24:00,1159,"I’ll go to the same resort 2 times max and then move onto a new conquest, kind of like women."

6695748,Camoclad,2022-11-07 10:58:00,628,"We have used the same outfitter for fly-in trips for many years though not always the same lake each year. Between my brother and I, we have been to 4 of their 6 lakes. As far as going back I would say it is the outfitter more than the fishing per se. We have found a routine for these trips and the outfitter fits our routine instead of the other way around (things like travel planning, grocery shopping for us, bait supply, and cabin amenities). I am starting to see some benefit to returning to a lake on subsequent trips, for example, this summer I went to a lake for the 3rd time and the learning curve is significantly shorter, which felt like a better fishing experience for the week. When the fish were not in the traditional places, we found fish easier because we had a better idea of where to look. Some of the appeal of the repeat trips is the opportunity to relive what made previous trips great, a nostalgia that is fun for me at least. This fall, went to a drive to camp that was a second time trip at a different part of the year and while the camp was the same, the fishing was completely different and that was enjoyable. I have a long commute to fish in Canada and I would confess that a good prior experience will likely get a consideration of returning just because I would hate to go that far and have a problem."
6695752,NETim1187,2022-11-07 11:20:00,166,"I stick with the same resort on LOTW. Been going there since '90. I like knowing where the rocks are. Most of them anyway. LOTW has always treated me very, very well."
6695764,prov1800,2022-11-07 12:36:00,5010,Thx Rich.I feel pretty fortunate that I can access those lakes so easy and pretty close to home.
6695842,Mojo-NC,2022-11-08 07:40:00,1929,"Our first year to Canada was to an all-inclusive resort on the Winnipeg River system. The water was very high that year, there was a lot of current, and the fish were really spread out. We had a guide almost every day, so we were able to catch a lot of fish but the walleyes were small and it was really expensive. We decided we'd rather rough it a bit more and fish a lake with better walleye fishing. A friend recommended a lake he had fished where the walleye fishing was excellent for both numbers and size. We continued to go back there for 15 years before we decided to try something new and fished one of their fly-in outpost lakes. We loved everything about it - the solitude of being the only boats on the lake and fishing was outstanding. We fished there for 2 years. Last year we decided to try out the houseboat experience on Lac Seul. We had a great time, but Delta Airlines screwed us out of a full day, and the houseboat journey up and back the lake took most of a couple of additional days. It was a great experience but we've now been there and done that. Next year we're going fish a new multi-species lake. I expect it to be another awesome experience."
6695844,pony,2022-11-08 07:41:00,19,I usually go back to the same lake and love the atmosphere at Huber's on Lake Wabigoon. Been going there since 1993. Taking my grandkids again this summer. Been to other lakes as well looking for more musky spots. Birch Ridge lodge at Leech Lake is great. My grandkids love the pizza there. Bass fishing there is great. My grandson and his buddy said it was their best fishing trip ever.

6695562,Eckohlt,2022-11-06 14:11:00,3685,"I'm always on the move,to see what's around the next corner,get to as many different lakes before the heart stops."

6695568,JAY221,2022-11-06 14:46:00,877,"At this point we go to the same place each year. I rebook before we leave if possible. Sometimes we have something up in the air so don't know a date yet and have to put it off. We have been to number of other places in the past and only had an issue twice that I wouldn't return to those camps. Both have since been sold and I have returned to one of them and had a great time. The current pace(Sleepy Dog Cabins) is a great camp/host and I like the way you can fish it. It is big enough that their is plenty of water but you can go to another section if the wind is howling and get out of it. It works for us! Later, Jay"
6695578,gordy28,2022-11-06 15:14:00,437,We have always moved on. Sometimes we have gone back to the same outfitter but we have always changed lakes Next trip will be the same I think. We just like seeing new water even though there are a few lakes we would probably go back to for sure Andrew
6695580,vteye3,2022-11-06 15:20:00,496,"We tried another outfitter for 5-6 trips. We found the lake was becoming developed. We decided to head west to the promised land for walleye and pike fishing. Nakina is a long drive but accessed lakes unlike anything back East at this level of service. Our group loves the solitude, numbers/nice walleye and potential for big pike. That being said I truly love running different rivers on non walleye trips."
6695584,kasmere,2022-11-06 15:43:00,20,We change outpost lakes every year. Yes sometimes we wonder about 'giving' up a good fishery but there are too many lakes and not enough time. All lakes have a different personality. The outfitter is also a big factor. Also we do our research and use this board as a great resourse. Going with Amik in 23......2nd time.....different lake though. I think the quality outfitters will not disappoint with the outposts or fishery.
6695624,rather-be-fishin,2022-11-06 17:28:00,429,"We have been going to the same lake, Lac Seul, in Ontario going on 20 years! We LOVE the quality of Walleye fishing there for numbers & size! The lake is big, so you can always explore & search out new fishing spots! We have not been disappointed any of the trips! In the 19 years we have gone to Lac Seul Lake, we have gone to 4 different resorts: 1 year at Golden Eagle, 1 year at Timberlane. Then we wanted to get further South on the lake, so spent 12 years at Fisherman's Cove & the last 5 years at Onaway Lodge! We are very satisfied with the fishing & the resort & service, so keep going back! We also book for the next year's trip when we leave the resort, so we keep our spot for the same cabin too. Count down is on, 9 months to go for our trip in 2023! Also, trying to put together a 2nd trip next summer too with the grandsons!!! RBF"

If I feel like for whatever reason the lake had a lot more to give I try to give them a second shot, but in general I like to do 2/3 spots new and the third is a standby that was awesome or I really want to fish again.To each his own but I am so glad I branched out and started seeking new water. If I hadn’t I wouldn’t have seen the Gorgeous Gods River the amazing fishing of great slave or the sheer quantity of stupid easy walleyes on remote Saskatoon/Manitoba lakes.Brett"
