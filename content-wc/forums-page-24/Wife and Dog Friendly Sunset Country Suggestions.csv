6699484,drlee,2022-12-04 20:42:00,409,"Take a look at Press Lake Camp. I know dogs are allowed. Real wilderness camp. Excellent walleye, northern, and small mouth are available. Easy lake to fish. 10,000 acres, 2 other lakes accessible easily by boat, only 1 camp, 7 cabins. NO private cottages. First Nation land surrounding. Number of husband/wife clients on a regular basis. Great hosts. Cabins are not fancy, but clean and each has indoor toilet, shower, sink. 24/7 generator electricity. Housekeeping only. Let me know if you want additional info. I am just a long time regular customer. No other ties. Nice sand beaches throughout the system. Having your own boat with electronics is a big advantage."
6698782,fishin779,2022-12-01 03:47:00,63,Have you looked at Crawford's Camp in Sioux Narrows ? Matt and his wife run a great place and fishing in that area can be pretty darn good !
6698786,walleyecheek,2022-12-01 04:42:00,2231,Arrowhead will take pets !
6698848,AsianAngler,2022-12-01 08:47:00,67,"My husband and i have taken our dog to many Ontario resorts. It is sometimes a challenge to find a resort that accepts pets on your chosen lake, but it can be done. I've even managed to get a ""no pets"" lodge to let us bring our dog one more than one occasion. However, there are a few tips that I would suggest. Don't allow your dog on the furniture or beds. If it cannot be avoided, bring a clean pet blanket or bed. A collapsible crate can also come in handy. You can tell owner that the dog will be crated if you have to leave the dog alone.Bring a small amount of cleaning products (for dogs and upholstery) and rags in case of an accident. A towel to wipe off dirty paws would also make owner happy.Be a responsible dog owner. ALWAYS pick up after your dog. Nothing sours owners more quickly than finding dog waste where it shouldn't be. Keep your dog leashed in camp.Consider bringing an outdoor bed for the boat. There are many nice beds where liquids just pass through and dry quickly. Depending upon the time of year, consider how you will keep your dog cool or warm. Dogs cannot regulate their temperature as easily as people. There are pads, coats, collars, and shades to keep them cool. Your dog should wear a life vest despite their ability to swim. We also use lure covers to avoid unintended hook injuries. Have a good, waterproof ,collar with ID. Microchip is a good idea too.Bring a small first aid kit for your dog. You should be able to find lists of suggested items on the Internet. Don't forget to have your dog's vaccinations up to date and bring papers for the border.Once you have a successful trip, ask the owner for a reference. Helps a great deal when making plans for your next trip. Have fun!Our favorite place was The Old Post on Lake St. Joseph."
6698866,Camoclad,2022-12-01 09:31:00,628,There are 2 fine camp hounds that will take all the petting you can give though!
6698872,Ricky Spanish,2022-12-01 10:28:00,1298,I would check with Temple Bay Lodge on Eagle Lake. I know I've seen some regular guests that brought their dogs in the past. Don't see anything about it on their website either way.
6699052,Tristian5431,2022-12-02 08:45:00,37,If you consider leaving the pup at home Hawk Lake Lodge is awesome. I was there with my wife and 3 year old. They have a great set up. Price point is up there but it was GREAT for my wife! She was super comfy!
6699056,WalleyeTherapy,2022-12-02 08:52:00,49,Yes. Bringing my own boat. Thanks
6699098,prov1800,2022-12-02 14:55:00,5010,[QUOTE=WalleyeTherapy;6699056]Talked to Wayne Clark today and he said they take pets with some rules.I know you said you have been to Cedar but they also have a drive in on the Indian Lake Chain on Edward Lake.That would be the KC Landing camp.You will find fishing there very good also.See your bringing your own boat.Very safe boating on the chain of 7 lakes.1000 ft sand beach.www.clarksresorts.com
6699306,WalleyeTherapy,2022-12-03 22:32:00,49,[QUOTE=prov1800;6699098]Thanks John. Didn't know Clark's take pets. We went out with you early July this Summer on Cedar. We went looking for Crappies and wound up Walleye fishing. I stayed at KCs 1 night before going to Antenna in May. The beach is actually a good idea with our dog.
6699346,prov1800,2022-12-04 06:20:00,5010,[QUOTE=WalleyeTherapy;6699306]That beach is beautifull for sure.
6698394,WalleyeTherapy,2022-11-29 07:47:00,49,"HI All, Looking for your suggestions on resorts that check some buttons I've never considered. My wife has displayed interest in joining on a trip to NW Ontario. Some of the things I'd be looking for in a resort: Drive In resort Very good fishing lake (Walleye, Pike) Dog Friendly (1 dog) Indoor flush toilets I've spent time at Cedar Lake and Ghost River and really enjoy both places. Looking for a new place to start a tradition with my Wife and Dog. Thanks in advance for your suggestions."
6698416,prov1800,2022-11-29 08:34:00,5010,Are you bringing your own boat.Maybe check out Onaway Lodge.On Lac Suel.Fantastic lodging and equipment.or check Vermilion Bay Lodge.Bigger lakes but has what your looking for.Also check out North Star Lodge on Clay Lake fantastic walleye and my favorite lake for large pike.
6698418,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2022-11-29 08:37:00,629,"#1. Grassy Narrows Lodge/Miles Bay area #2. Ballard's Black Island/Hanson Bay area #3. Tamarack Island Lodge/Basil area These are camps that you would drive to a location(Morson, Ont./Hanson Bay) & are boated-in by the camp or by your personal rig. House Keeping or American Plan provided by all 3 camps. All have Websites of their facilities."
6698450,bthomas3333,2022-11-29 10:11:00,465,I'd consider Witch Bay or Hawk Lake Lodge. Two different price points but both have served me well in the past.
6698610,eyecatcher1,2022-11-30 07:01:00,323,Moosehorn Lodge in Sioux Lookout works for us. They offer housekeeping and American Plan.
6698620,Fisherman Ted,2022-11-30 07:37:00,461,Thanks for the recommendation Brett. However Hawk Lake Lodge does not accept pets. Cheers -FT
6698642,prov1800,2022-11-30 08:17:00,5010,That sucks Ted.Some pets are better behaved than some guests.lol.
6698652,proguidedream,2022-11-30 08:32:00,345,"if dog is kenneled in the truck over nights, and leashed during the day around other guests i dont see any problems. if you want to have your dog in the boat while your fishing and let it swim or run around islands. however lodges take huge responsibility letting dogs in cabins. and trusting owners not to let them roam around the grounds. -even taking a dump by someones porch while they are eating dinner guest might find that to be a huge turn off to not come back. -plus the liability of attacking a guest or damaging property. or people with allergies. sometimes it is just easier to say no."
6698664,bthomas3333,2022-11-30 08:54:00,465,Shoot. I know that. I just saw wife and sunset country and thought HLL. Brett
6698680,v-bay gord,2022-11-30 10:01:00,3168,"Nope, don't take pets either but appreciate the referral."
