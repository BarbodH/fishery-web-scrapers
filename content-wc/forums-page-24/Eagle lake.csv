6699590,prov1800,2022-12-05 13:05:00,5010,Good day from The Vermilion Bay dock.
6699614,walleyecheek,2022-12-05 15:22:00,2231,I dont see any ice shacks out there !
6699640,prov1800,2022-12-05 18:09:00,5010,Fishing sucks right there.About 2 south is where the action is.No permanent shacks up here in Canada much.couple here and there.Most people just come out on nice days or bring pop-ups.No ice shack villages up here.Thats a good thing.

6699646,prov1800,2022-12-05 18:26:00,5010,Can custom pick your preferred action right on the shoreline before you head out.
6699654,Eckohlt,2022-12-05 18:48:00,3685,That's right all shapes n sizes.
6699656,prov1800,2022-12-05 19:03:00,5010,They have caught a lot of fish over the years.I remember using them.Basically were used as a set line.Bit of orange tape tighted to line and line wrapped around tip of willow and your spool of line pushed down in the snow and it would turn like giving drag.I still do that for lake trout.
6699660,Eckohlt,2022-12-05 19:15:00,3685,"I'll have a whole aresonal of them Thursday,if it's good enough for you it's good enough for my wife.lol"
