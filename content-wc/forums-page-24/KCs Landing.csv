6700934,prov1800,2022-12-12 17:11:00,5010,Thx Eck.Glad you had a safe trip home.Thx for the complement.I think you have a keeper wife to.Was fun having you all up.
6700994,Bill Krejca,2022-12-13 05:48:00,6107,"Good to have a family gathering, especially in a fishing setting. Re: Perch- So many which I have caught in most places have worms(white grubs) in the flesh, so my interest in them is marginal at best.(Small mouth the same story.) I know, the usual response to this statement is to ignore the worms, they cook up fine. i have done this before, but just choose not to. Bill"
6701012,prov1800,2022-12-13 07:21:00,5010,"Some areas/lakes do have worms in the perch.Some lakes I fish have zero.Personally I normally don't keep perch.My wife won't eat them period.Lucky we have walleye all over,but have found some worms in walleye to.Usually not many.Not sure about smallmouth Bill never eat them.Rather eat pike.lol.have not found worms in them.Lake trout can have some but nothing like a perch.Crappies all clean to."
6701104,Eckohlt,2022-12-13 14:33:00,3685,The only worms I've found in fish are the ones i dangle in front of them.
6702111,Bakefish,2022-12-18 09:34:00,1077,Lake Gerard. It's just to the east of Cedar.
6702127,prov1800,2022-12-18 10:55:00,5010,Gerard lake is good but long way in to get there.At least now with logging cuts its easy to access off the April rd and then Ord lake rd Have driven by it a few times.Gold Arrow camp has a boat laying just off the road.i can now see Portage Bay and Muskie Bay from the Ord rd.Also big logging cut past Clarks toward Keystone Lodge.can now see Grassie Bay from Camp Robinson rd.
6700586,prov1800,2022-12-10 19:59:00,5010,The 2 ladies are smoking it.Ecks wife caught a beauty perch tonight.I hardly ever catch them.lol.weatger is good so Eck drilling some holes outside away from shacks.
6700592,RichA$1970,2022-12-10 22:58:00,1159,"John, is there a good Perch lake up in your area? I know they are overlooked based on the other great species you have up there, but I’ve stumbled on some and would love to take a trip dedicated to Perch. I know Whitefish and Kabi are good lakes but those are more SE of you."
6700602,7 Mag,2022-12-11 04:42:00,1887,"Nice perch, looks like everyone is having a great time."
6700608,prov1800,2022-12-11 05:48:00,5010,There's pockets of perch on most lakes but all seem to be on the small side and have to filter through a lot to get any decent ones.Dont often fish much for them.
6700610,prov1800,2022-12-11 05:52:00,5010,Think they are enjoying themselves.
6700618,RichA$1970,2022-12-11 06:24:00,1159,Sounds good and it’s a bonus fish I consider. I didn’t catch it but here’s tonight’s dinner which my fiancé gets the credit on steaming the sea bass
6700622,prov1800,2022-12-11 07:14:00,5010,Looks fancy
6700902,prov1800,2022-12-12 15:01:00,5010,Going to be our supper tonight.Caught them yesterday evening.Ecks crew last night there.
6700918,Eckohlt,2022-12-12 16:26:00,3685,"Made it home,it was fun fun fun!!!!,it was so nice to meet the rest of your family and I don't think you could find a nicer wife."
6700920,Eckohlt,2022-12-12 16:31:00,3685,"She didn't totally out fish me,she paid me to hold that perch,I got that big ole perch.lol"
6700372,prov1800,2022-12-09 18:38:00,5010,"So Eck arrived at camp late Wed with his wife,brother and brothers daughter.Everything was ready and they fished that evening and had a good bite.I popped in around 9 am next morning and we all caught fish throughout the day.Eck had been in the shack since 3 am.lol.Went back to camp around 3 this afternoon.Eck again had been in shack since 3 am.lol.Hes getting his fishing.When we got there Eck and his wife were fishing outside the shack so I joined them as he had drilled a few holes.Had a good bite out there.I went in the shack and joined my wife and one of my boys and the grand kid.He was having a ball in the freebie minnow pail.Fishing turned on in the shack and had lots of action and I caught a decent one.Ill come back tomorrow afternoon."
6700374,prov1800,2022-12-09 18:41:00,5010,Fished till dark and had a awesome moon on our way home.
6700392,RichA$1970,2022-12-10 01:31:00,1159,Great pics and glad you and Eck’s wife caught some nice ones. Looks like Eck is posing with the bait or a musky lure.
6700430,prov1800,2022-12-10 06:07:00,5010,I'll tell him that later today.He did catch a few better fish yesterday.Day before only caught small males.Hes out every morning at 3 am.lol.Was nice yesterday and he drilled holes away from shack that did good.
6700432,Bill Krejca,2022-12-10 06:08:00,6107,"Gotta be tough, having the fishing so close! Bill"
6700442,prov1800,2022-12-10 06:22:00,5010,About half hour winding through the back roads to get there.Weather is really nice.
6700560,prov1800,2022-12-10 18:27:00,5010,Happy fisherman.
6700564,RichA$1970,2022-12-10 18:43:00,1159,"Well, still looks like Eck’s wife is on top of the leaderboard and glad they are having fun up there. I’m not fishing but the water is perfect here on Koh Samet."
6700580,Yellowfin123,2022-12-10 19:40:00,2182,"looks like ol eck is getting smoked pretty bad by the money maker, ""wife"""
