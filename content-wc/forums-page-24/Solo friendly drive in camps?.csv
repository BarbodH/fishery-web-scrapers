6701026,proguidedream,2022-12-13 08:39:00,345,something you may want to look into is VRBO or private rental cabins. there are a few around LOTW east side that are quite small. (small = less expensive). would be private or a semi private like a guest cabin being rented out.
6701076,NM_Trout,2022-12-13 12:11:00,1094,Thanks all... very good input!
6701469,Fisherman Ted,2022-12-15 08:14:00,461,My lodge (Hawk Lake) takes solo fishermen all the time. There is no upcharge. You get the same private cabin and boat as everyone else. Cheers -FT
6701579,pjshorthorn,2022-12-16 01:47:00,5654,"Vermilion Bay Lodge on Eagle is a good solo possibility. Late summer and the fall are probably better times for what you are wanting to do. The walleye will typically be deeper (20+ ft), but the possibility of bigger fish is better. There there 7-8 different species in the lake…….with walleye , lake trout, northern and Muskie being the main ones. People also do well on smallmouth, perch and whitefish. You would catch the occasional rock bass as well. The only one I haven’t checked off yet is an Eelpout. No worries about the eelpout, I hear that the lodge owner is an eelpout guide so he can get you on that fish too.If you are looking for an affordable drive to location, this is one that you should check into. Have fun, I love doing solo trips on occasion as well.PjShorthorn"
6701895,zenfish,2022-12-17 08:04:00,14,"Cliff Lake Resorts. I was there solo in July with no upcharge. Great musky, Lake trout, and smallmouth. Not a numbers lake for walleye but caught a good number of mid 20's fish. Highly recommend."
6700808,NM_Trout,2022-12-12 07:46:00,1094,"I'm looking to start collecting a list of drive-to camps that will accommodate a solo-fisherman. I may or may not bring my own boat. I would not need to make a reservation in advance, I'll have a more flexible schedule and can just pop in to fill an open cabin slot. Know any camps in the Vermillion Bay and north of there that accommodate solo-fishermen? (Yeah... I know that I can reach out and ask. I'm hoping to narrow the field with info from those who have done this. Thanks!)"
6700824,Walleye2242,2022-12-12 08:49:00,263,As a fellow solo guy i understand where you are coming from. I fish the red lake and gullrock area mostly. I have found sept. to be a very friendly solo month as well as july. I prefer sept of course. Late sept there are usuualy many openings and you can just give them a call and they will fit you in as long as they are still open.
6700832,7 Mag,2022-12-12 10:13:00,1887,"I mostly fish solo, i've not had a problem finding a spot in the late summer or fall, spring is a different story. Moosehorn on Pelican, Pine Beach on Eagle & Manotak on Perrault are a few. I'm booked for a solo trip the last week of August at Pine Beach, if you've never fished Eagle it's an awesome lake."
6700858,MN_Moose,2022-12-12 12:48:00,964,Are you thinking housekeeping or American Plan? (meals)
6700876,prov1800,2022-12-12 13:21:00,5010,I'd check out Little Vermilion Lodge.He has some smaller cabins.Also try Cedar Lake lodge they have some smaller cabins also.And lost Bay resort has another camp away from main lodge that is like a over flow.think there's 4-5 cabins there.thats on Cliff Lake.I have guided some couples at Keystone Lodge to and I know northern Lights will take you.Worth checking out
6700882,Yellowfin123,2022-12-12 13:53:00,2182,"If you want lac suel i know mahkwa will take singles and probably some on nw seul too.. if you look around lot of places go from weekly to nightly after june 20 to jul 1, after that you could go to all kinds of places when i comes to drive inn or boat in"
6700952,NM_Trout,2022-12-12 19:15:00,1094,"Either one, but mostly housekeeping or less. I'm so dang cheap, and when I am fishing I frequently forget to come in for meals anyway :-) If I could find a place with a bed, a sink, a stove, a small fridge and access to a shower and toilet I'd be more than fine. Mostly interested in 1) Good fishing 2) Not too bad of access (no long, rutted dirt roads)3) Not a lake that has a lot of recreational boating 4) Mostly mosquito proof :-)No need for TV, wifi, electricity. If it is there, great. But not something I have to have. I don't take fish home at all, and I can't eat them every night, so a freezer isn't needed."
6700960,That Minnesota guy,2022-12-12 20:45:00,8293,Not many things worse than a cabin that has holes in the screens and the mosquitos buzz all night.

You can arrange an occasional meal in the lodge if you choose. He has a couple of smaller cabins. Easy access just off the 17. Fishing has been very good. I go in September and mosquitoes are almost non-existent. I have been going there since 1988."
