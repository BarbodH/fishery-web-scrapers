LOL no Brett...all the 47s would not get me to trade the memory of this big girl!!!Quote: Originally Posted by dhottleDid you get a weight on her before release?

6697554,jambi,2022-11-22 15:04:00,504,"Went north from Oklahoma to hunt in the UP last week. Had a great time seeing old friends. Shot over to Nisswa MN to pick up my 52"" Alaska Northern pike replica from Mike at Fibertech. When I walked into Mike's shop I saw her up on the wall...HOLY &$TI does this girl look awesome. The head is perfectly matched to the body. Mike did a better job than I could imagine. Thanks for the recommendation here on WC. Please send Mike your business; he was great to work with. On the drive home I stopped in Des Moines for the night and snuggled up to my girl LOL. One cool sidenote is when I was kid back in the late 70s, our summer vacations were in the Brainerd area - it was memorable to be back there picking up my dream Pike.http://www.fibertechproductions.com/"
6697570,prov1800,2022-11-22 15:54:00,5010,That is one wicked pike for sure.Beautifull job as well.The spots are very well done.
6697590,bthomas3333,2022-11-22 19:29:00,465,Looks great! Very cool!Brett

6697596,pjshorthorn,2022-11-23 00:24:00,5654,"Awesome fish and mount. Mike at FIbertech did an amazing job on my 45Â” pike mount back in 2015. It still looks brand new. Mike has a vast array of molds for all types of species. If you can't find a mold there, you won't find it anywhere else most likely. When she is dusty, you can take it outside and rinse it off too LOL Enjoy the replica. PjShorthorn"
6697608,jambi,2022-11-23 06:34:00,504,Thanks Rich...Caught on Red & White Johnson's sliver minnow (big one - 1.5 oz?). She hit about 8 ft from the boat. Never had a chance to mess up the strike; it was like she appeared and had it in her mouth all in one motion. Fishing thick cabbage making short pitch-casts to keep the weeds off the lure. Captain and I both saw the take and we were speechless...Great fight and Release. Truly magical.
6697622,JDP,2022-11-23 08:09:00,1457,Truly a great fish and mount! Congrats!
6697628,bthomas3333,2022-11-23 08:56:00,465,Can I trade you my 5 47s for your one 52? Deal? Great fish! Brett
6697630,dhottle,2022-11-23 09:10:00,163,Did you get a weight on her before release? Beautiful mount.
