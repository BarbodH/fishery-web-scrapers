6702443,prov1800,2022-12-20 12:53:00,5010,Just will have to do a bit different fishing and check it out.Be fun.
6701803,Yellowfin123,2022-12-16 17:59:00,2182,I'd bet gordon's right on the money that deep in portage bay
6701805,prov1800,2022-12-16 18:17:00,5010,So there are some lake trout in Portage Bay.Have caught some there but lots ot Whitefish to.Youll have to try fishing that depth when you see them again.
6701811,Eckohlt,2022-12-16 18:41:00,3685,"That's the best way to find out,stick one with a hook."
6702177,Mike311,2022-12-18 16:57:00,40,I’ve seen that for years in Portage and always wondered myself. Have never tried fishing it though. There’s a guy who trolls with down riggers back and forth every summer so I’ve always assumed lake trout also.
6702195,Anonymouse,2022-12-18 18:08:00,834,"At those depths Walleyes tend to be suspended just under the thermocline, not cruising the mud for dinner, because they are still feeding in the shallows at night and won't/can't waste the effort to acclimate their swim bladder from that deep.Clearly whitefish with perhaps a few hunting Lake Trout under them, though that too is doubtful as there is no size discrepancy in the returns to indicate larger Lake Trout mixed in with smaller whitefish."
6702219,phishfearme,2022-12-18 21:31:00,1242,"although white fish and lakers are the best bet, there's no reason to rule out pike - especially with the 70degF surface temp which is more of a summer situation. i had similar readings one time and dropped down a jig hoping for lake or possibly brook trout and promptly hauled up a 32-inch pike that was the deepest of greens and felt like it came out of a fridge. phish"
6702279,Lazy Fisherman,2022-12-19 10:18:00,276,I am guessing whitefish.
6702291,v-bay gord,2022-12-19 10:59:00,3168,I've iced fished in Portage Bay and marked what I thought were walleyes......had bites....could see them coming up to the jig. Finally caught two.....they were ciscoes....about 12 inches long. It's possible that is what you are marking too.
6702417,7 Mag,2022-12-20 10:14:00,1887,"I know a guy that fishes the west arm for lake trout, he mostly jig fishes but i did see a boat with down riggers in Portage Bay."
6702435,djglover7,2022-12-20 12:25:00,54,"Assuming warmer water above.Below or above the thermocline?Below is deeper, and colder."
6701731,7 Mag,2022-12-16 12:53:00,1887,"This past fall i was marking fish that were deep, do you think they are walleyes or lake trout, the lake has both?"
6701741,v-bay gord,2022-12-16 13:29:00,3168,My guess would be a mixture of whitefish and lake trout.....probably more whitefish.
6701749,Eckohlt,2022-12-16 13:53:00,3685,Did you try to catch one to find out what they were??
6701751,prov1800,2022-12-16 14:00:00,5010,My guess would be Whitefish.Depends which part of the lake you were on also.
6701763,prov1800,2022-12-16 14:26:00,5010,"Those can be easy to catch.Most jigging lures will work,my favorite is a white/silver pearl 1/8 oz vibrato.If there's Lake trout they love that lure to.Great way to change the day up.Great eating fish."
6701769,7 Mag,2022-12-16 14:44:00,1887,"No, If it was walleye I didn’t want to bring one up at that depth."
6701771,7 Mag,2022-12-16 14:45:00,1887,I was in Portage Bay John
6701773,7 Mag,2022-12-16 14:46:00,1887,"Thanks John, I'll remember that."
6701775,7 Mag,2022-12-16 14:47:00,1887,"Thanks Gord, I don't know anything about whitefish, never caught one."
6701787,Eckohlt,2022-12-16 16:07:00,3685,"It's a guessing game on here,there's only one way to really know what they are,rod n reel."
