They can have 2 boats on Favourable Lake which is a good lake but a very unsafe and long portage to get there. We used Big Hook last year and they had a cabin on a piece of land between Favourable and Lemonade, let me say you would not be disappointed."

All Ryan Brady's lakes are excellent for walleye and pike In 2003 at Dearden Lake I caught 4 pike over 40 inches and hundreds of walleye up to 25inches.We are going to Windsor lake,a new lake this year. www.northern outposts.com. If you want to talk with me or any of the other guys who have fished with northern outposts You can e-mail me at [email protected] And I will get you in touch with them Larry S"

554280,Guest,2006-02-01 13:51:00,0,"I think you should add Viking to this list. I have fished with them when able, probably 12 out of the last 20 years, and the fishing is excellent. Excellent service. Very nice flyin cabins. Their service runs out of Red Lake and prices are competitive."
554283,Mr. Walleye,2006-02-01 15:50:00,74,"I've been going with Northern Outposts since Ryan & Kathy Brady started up about 6 years ago. I've been to Dearden and Obashi lakes with them. This year we're going to Blackbirch Lake which they just opened in 2005. Our fishing has been fantastic, and the accomodations are great. TONS OF WALLEYES with an average of 18-19 inches. Largest we've had is 27 1/2 inches. Tons 23 and up. We don't fish pike, but have caught many over 36, with the biggest being 45 inches. I've been to Canada 20+ years now. Northern Outposts easily has the best combination of walleye numbers and size that we've experienced. I met a guy at the show in Madison who fishes Shouldice Lake for pike with them. One year the four in his group caught something like 29 pike over 40 inches in 5 days. They keep coming back, just as we do. I couldn't give an outfitter a higher recommendation. Hope this helps."

However, I know Ryan personally and know you would not be disappointed in his service. I have talked to several individuals that go back year after year. Holinshead is 2 hours south of Armstrong and a lesser drive. Go with Ryan, you won't be dissapointed."

554378,phishfearme,2006-02-06 11:37:00,1242,"dean - we've been to way north (when it was owned by kevin geary) and also obashi lake with northern outposts. both are totally different setups - way north is a lodge with nearby cabins and N.O. is fly-in ""rent a lake all to yourself"". way north can almost garuantee a trophy northern, gaurantee good laker fishing and get you to two lakes (lemonade and setting net) where 100 walleye days per person are achievable. if you want isolation though this ain't the place for you. at obashi lake (we spent 10 days there) you can catch lots and lots of walleye but we didn't get anything over 18 1/2 inches - but did take home 75 jumbo perch 11""-13"". kathy and ryan are wonderful outfitters and we rebooked dearden with them for this year but then ran into their 15% increase in rates and decided to go elsewhere. they've become the ""high priced spread"" due mostly to their long flight distances to the lakes. we've decided to use an outfitter out of pickle lake that provides excellent lakes within about 5-10 minutes flight from pickle lake and his prices are $400 cheaper for a week trip. you can see a posting i did on a previous trip at:https://www.walleyecentral.com/dc/dcb...ng_type=search best of luck, phish"
