I have been working in the chemical dependency field as a counselor since 1983. Once a person has submitted the appropriate documentation and forms, currently how long is the wait for getting approval, or disapproval, for crossing the border into Canada? Thanks"
554219,Guest,2006-01-30 18:22:00,0,"View the following link. It will describe the process involved. In most cases if your DUI conviction is more than 10 years ago, you are deemed rehabilitated. There are some caveats to that general rule. Go to http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/conviction.html It will direct you on who you should contact. Agate"

554247,Guest,2006-01-31 14:11:00,0,"you can also apply for ""dual citizenship"" right at the border. It lasts for 3 years and allows immediate entry into canada. I think this has to be done at the border and cost around 300 dollars. You can probably get all the proper paperwork for a more nominal fee but this is another option. I did this."
554253,Guest,2006-01-31 16:35:00,0,Seriously? One can literally become a dual American/Canadian citizen for $300. at the Canadian border? On the Candian side? Is this new or? I am very interested in this.

The exception would be if you want to give the goverment $400,000.00 Canadian, which they will return in 5 years with no interest. They are serious when it comes to letting us imigrate into the coutry. It is too bad America does not take the same stance towards all the imigrants flowing through our borders."

We like north-west Ontario, the trees, lakes, isolation and cooler climate. The people are friendly like in our rural community. I am looking forward to the fishing, hunting, snowmobiling and float flying that area of the country has to offer. There are business oportunities, as there are everywhere, for those inclined to pursue them. Yes, there are things I don't agree with in both countries,in NWO my main concern is health care, we will feel compelled to continue to pay our health insurance and use it if necessary. I consider that part of the tuition in making the move and want to state that is our choice and do not mean to make waves with those that are happy with the current medical system. Remember, in the US we have our own set of problmes, like illegal alians, people that are on the dole that can work but won't, high medical costs, a real need for tort reform, and to put a collar on some of the obscene financial judgements which are being passed out which makes insurance and all things so much more expensive. We will have a vote just like the US and I expect it will have the same effect in NWO as it does here in rural America. For us this is a calculated decision to make the move, and we consider ourselves fortunate to be able to live our dream in such a wonderful place."
