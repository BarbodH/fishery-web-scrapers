I've had really good luck doing this on other lakes. Tube jigs work well too if a slower approach is needed. We pulled about 10 smallies per stop off rock outcropings fishing these methods. The lipless crank works well when trying to find the structure (covers more water quickly).

554401,jerry bark,2006-02-06 19:52:00,822,torpedos are a good bet they are one of my go-to lures as well. i also have good kuck with firetiger floating rapalas when fishing around shallow rock piles in 3-7' of water. jerry
