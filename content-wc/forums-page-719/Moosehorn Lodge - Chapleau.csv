The best type of whiskey going.:cheers: I've spent alot of time in the Chapleau/Timmins area and there is great fishing to be had. Walleye, pike, white fish, and speckled trout fishing is very good. Smallmouth bass are making their way up there slowly but surely. If you're into the speckled trout fishing at all bring a canoe (or steal one I don't care) and find the stocking lists from the MNR for the area. You'll need a current topo map and to match it up with the list, but if you have enough time you'll have some great fun. I have seen some huge specks up there. Take it easy Urs Duelberg"

I have a cabin just up the road and they have been very accomidating at letting us keep our boats there and purchase what ever is needed at very good rates (meals, bait, licenses, pretty much everything but lodging). they have one of the finer fish houses i have used at any lodge up there over the last 15 years and their main lodge and dock system is very nice. talking to a few of the folks that stayed there when on the dock has produced good comments on accomidations. Nice people, Nicole runs the office and will take care of you day or night. Food is good, and the lodge owner last year pulled a 58 inch muskie from lac suel with one of here guides last year. i swear it was the fish i lost in the same stinking spot. Oh yea, very nice boats to rent. 18ft new with 50hp 4 strokes as standard and a few larger if you need them. good luck contact me offline if you need any specifics.[email protected]"

I am headed to the Chapleau area this summer. Our reservations are July 22 - 29. We are going to Happy Day Lodge. I am camping with my family and my mother in law. Should be a grrreat time!HA!HA! In all seriousness, we only heard good things about fishing in the Chapleau area and we were told about Happy Day Lodge. We talked with the owners and they seemed nice and were helpful. Just curious how many men have taken their family and mother in law on a fishing trip? Tell me, should I cancel now or take up a bottle of Tylenol?!?"
