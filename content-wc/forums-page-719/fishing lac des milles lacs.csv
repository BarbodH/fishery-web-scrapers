554057,Guest,2006-01-25 21:08:00,0,"I've gone there for about the last 20 years or so. Since the slots took place the qualty of the fish has gone up. We very seldom use to catch walleye over 20"", but now we catch quite a few between 18"" and 22"". The northerns are getting bigger two but we are having a harder time catching the 27"" ones which are about the biggest you can keep.We are still catching alot of 25"" or 26"" ones. We mostly troll crank baits. We aways stay at pine point resort because it is located in center of the lake. Hope this helps,good fishing"

554185,Guest,2006-01-29 00:02:00,0,"We use to stay at maki-bay untill I started pulling my own boat. I still go there and bolton bay a couple of times when I'm up there. They now have a road to maki-bay,but never been on it. Everyone that knows the lake usually has no trouble catching fish."
554191,Guest,2006-01-29 16:18:00,0,The Maki Bay road is 39km of adventure. I would never trailer a decent boat into there. The place is great but I'd rent their equipment. Very narrow and very hilly in spots with logging trucks hauling when I was there. Fishing was very good.
554201,Guest,2006-01-29 22:57:00,0,I have fished LDML every July since 2001. We always limit out on pike and eyes. Best pike was 17lbs. Best eye was 9lbs. We stay at The Thunderbird Resort and ride each day to Bolton Bay area. I am considering staying at Pine Point Resort in 2006. Tight lines....
554369,Guest,2006-02-05 22:54:00,0,vote gop- How do you usually fish the lake? I think you will really like staying at pine point. It will be alot closer for you since you fish the east side.
554372,pfg1,2006-02-05 23:49:00,52,"We fish Bolton Bay on LDML in early July every year since 2000. We cast #5 Mepps with Blue bodies and white hair in 7-20 feet of water. Another method is to troll crank baits in 10-40 feet of water. Eyes are caught with worm harnesses and bottom-bouncing Lindy Rigs. I use a length of Fluorcarbon as terminal tackle to decrease the bite-offs from pike when fishing eyes. It cuts down the bite-offs by 90% or more. One word of caution about table rocks. Monitor the water level. If the resort owner tells you it is low then fish new areas with caution. I know of several Buick-sized rocks that stand 3"" below the surface in 50 feet of water! Gotta have a GPS for marking both rocks and safe routes. Fish On! pfg1"
