Also we have heard about gulp products in the 4 inch range, is this the right size or do they make them bigger? One more is there a soft/hard plastic lure that resembles a whitefish besides the banjo minnow? I have googled but not what I'm looking for. Thank You The Rock"

I suppose there may be a few, but I doubt if it is a primary food source for gamefish. From my experience crayfish, perch fry, minnows, leeches and aquatic larvae appear to be the main food sources for fish on Pringle. By hook color do you mean jig color or the actual hook? I personally do not believe red hooks make much difference. Jig colors that were hot for my Dad and I were: pink/white, orange/green chartreuse (I make these, I've never seen them available commercially), yellow chartreuse/orange, and purple. We used 4"" twisters and power baits in orange, white, pink, yellow, blue, purple, etc. (opaque pink was hot the last year we were there), 3"" Gulp minnows, and about 4"" sections of purplish or electric blue finesse worms. The worms were hot during mayfly hatches. Take some crankbaits in crayfish patterns that dive 6-12 feet and troll the shorelines on the same side of the lake as the cabin all the way down to the ""narrows"". I can't remember my directions right now. There is a small island almost to the narrows on the cabin side. Troll around that area and there is some good structure. Go all the way down to the narrows and keep going until you run into the 4-5 foot flats, turn around and troll your way back. This pattern produced for us when the wind was out of the west or south west. Best tip I can give you for Pringle (won't tell you exactly where, finding them is half the fun) LOOK FOR SUBMERGED REEFS. Use the sun to find them while you are camp, wink, wink, hint, hint. If you want some more info. email me at [email protected]. Happy to help you out however I can."
