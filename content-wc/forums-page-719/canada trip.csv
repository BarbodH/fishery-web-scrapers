Fishing and scenery are awesome. The woman river chain has dozens of lakes to chose from. Kabeelo Lodge is downright spectacular for a lodge in the middle of the woods. Been to both and know the area well. Breathtaking. The folks at Kabeelo lodge used to have a northern pike that they would feed everyday by their dock, very entertaining to see. Just like a family of ducks... Greg"

554362,Guest,2006-02-05 12:20:00,0,"I have fished both of those lakes and both are great,I was on Margerate about ten years ago and caught many many fish, I guess if I had my choice I would take Ruddy asit is connected to Bertha and we have caught and released many Pike in the 40-44"" class also there is a lot of real nice Walleyes as well.You won`t be dissapointed with either lake, I have been to Kabeelo Lodge 40 times in the last 20 years and have never been sorry"

Try Kenora Air out of Kenora. We are staying at an outpost on the English River. I know you can drive there, but may need a boat to get to it. We are doing the fly-in method. MJ is great to work with. Tell her Christian sent you."

554266,Guest,2006-02-01 07:05:00,0,"Steve-I would ""Highly recommend Holinshead Resort, located 2 hours north of Thunder Bay. This lake would definately be what you are looking for. Their website is www.holinshead.ca. Feel free to e-mail me at [email protected]. I have been returning to this lake for 14 years in a row. I'll be happy to help you out in any way.-Greg"

554273,Guest,2006-02-01 09:25:00,0,"Try South Bay Lodge, it is a boat in lodge on Confederation Lake and they are the only camp so very secluded. You drive to Ear Falls and then from there it is 40 miles northeast to the landing where they pick you up and take you by boat to the lodge which is about 8 minutes away or so. Its a big pike lake with lots of nice sized lake trout. If you want walleye they do have some portage lakes nearby that you walk into and they have boats there. The fishing can be great in these lakes, no fishing pressure whatesoever. Give there website a look. www.southbaylodge.com Dave H."
554274,Guest,2006-02-01 10:15:00,0,"SyracuseSteve, I'll second the motion for South Bay Lodge. I've been there a few times, but the last was two years ago. It seems to meet your criteria very well Steve. It's a short boat-in, and is very isolated. The only other boats we have seen were others from the lodge. We went in mid-July. We loved casting for the big northerns. We went in and tried the walleye action on a small portage lake (maybe 75 yard portage), where they had a boat waiting. We got into a couple great schools of fish. Nothing too huge; I think the biggest walleye was maybe 25-26"", but caught close to 100 between two of us. This was a great option for when the weather was more walleye-like (as in crappy). When it got nice, and the pike got going again, we decided to focus on pike again. When you can consistently catch big pike over 40"" each day, life is good! Chuck Bollinger"
