553722,Guest,2006-01-12 01:47:00,0,"Hello, My 13yr old son and I are interested in pairing up with one or two other dads and their sons for a Canada trip in 2006. Got your own rig? So do we. Our 20' Lund Alaskan and 75HP Yamaha tiller will go anywhere in Canada. We have fished Ontario since 2001 with six trips to Press Lake and Lac de Mille Lacs. We are returning to LDML again this July with our gang of 15. We would like to plan a second trip in late July or anytime in August but nobody in our regular gang can go on second trip. We live in SE Wisconsin. Any camp within 20 hours drive time is fine. Any ideas? Thanks, DAVID"
553726,Guest,2006-01-12 09:03:00,0,"Hi Dave, I also have a 13yr son. My question for you is what do you folks fish for? I usually go to Dryberry in early August for musky and smallmouth. You and your son would be welcome to join us. Dave"
553733,Guest,2006-01-12 13:39:00,0,What do they fish for? Uhhhh...this is WALLEYE Central...

553738,Guest,2006-01-12 21:37:00,0,"Hello, My 13yr old is NOT a walleye fisherman. He loves the action of pike, muskies and smallies. I am not familiar with Dryberry. Email me at [email protected] with more info. We are headed to Waupaca tomorrow for small game hunting. I would like to talk more about the possibilities. Please email me. Thanks, DAVID"
553762,troutaholic,2006-01-15 03:28:00,827,"David P, If you have an opportunity to go to Dryberry, don't pass it up!! It is one of the most pristine lakes there is. It is currently being managed for trophy lakers...lakers of 20 pounds are common!! We caught and released 10 lakers between 15 and 26 pounds in one day! We kept two(2) 8-pounders for supper. Huge Muskies.....usually troll for them. Smallmouth are monstrous as well....we went casting for them until our arms fell off from all the hits.....crazy. Due to the Ph leavels, walleyes do not live in dryberry. They are in Berry lake which is fed by berry. The camp that we stayed at (the only one on Dryberry - not sure if it wasn't sectioned off) one had to drive across berry to get to the camp and portage to Dryberry. Talk about an experience.....wouldn't mind going up for the grouse hunting...heck, I almost caught one or two with my coat!!! Just Rip Lips and Keep a Tight Line"
