I'm assuming the water is pretty clear. Here in Wyoming I'm a fan of power pro - yellow for jigging. Most of the discussion I've read about hi visibility line - has shown no determential affect to the bite - at least that is the general concensus. With that shallow of water - and it being pretty clear (?) is mono a better choice? Pickeral Bay subject to many snags? I do like the strength of the braid to keep from re -tieing. (bad eyes) I suppose there is the flourocarbon leader, but that just adds another component. Tks. Rick"
554375,Guest,2006-02-06 10:26:00,0,I use 6lb fireline with a mono leader in Pickeral Bay. I do not believe that the high visible line will have much effect though. I use the mono for more of a shock absorber. These fish will swim into a gil net so the high visible line won't have much effect. One thing you must understand about Pickeral Bay is there is only about a 2 week window when the Walleye are in there and biting. This all depends on the spring. If you miss it it can be bad fishing. If you hit it right you will have 100 plus days of 3 to 4 pounders. If you are going May 20th ( long weekend ) chances are the ice will still be on the lake.
554384,Guest,2006-02-06 13:19:00,0,"Tiller: Did know there was some risk going early. At least for the moment the weather is leaning to an early ice out, but that can all change of course. Seems early stands the best chance of those outstanding days you mentioned. Lake trout: This is what I have read (but not experienced), early the lake trout are up on the surface. (15-0 depth) One of the go to methods at this camp is large spoons - Like the Lucky Strike Canoe I have always thought of trout fishing as that of a higher speed trolling wise. Certainly a function of the lure used. I'm evalulating what boat we take and what it is capable of doing in terms of low speed troll. Walleye speed is like 2.0-2.5 mph on the average. Lake trout at this time of year about like that - faster and/or slower? Thanks in advance, Rick"
554388,Guest,2006-02-06 15:24:00,0,"Rick, I would fish the trout fast as well. If you find them they will be shallow and aggressive. No need for down riggers this time of year. Thin fins seem to work well for trout on La Ronge. Obviously you will need a guide if you are not familiar with lake."
554394,Guest,2006-02-06 18:06:00,0,"Tiller, Any specifics about the best bite (morning/day/evening etc.) for lake trout? If there is such a thing! The outfitter certainly want's his client's to catch fish and that is a great source for the where/when. I'd think with them being shallow, a fish finder is not of much value as they would spook with the boat?. Which would mean that fishing where/when which has been good would be the best advice. Any other tips about finding them - other than hiring a guide! The camp is right next to trout narrows which as I understand it, is a popular location fish for them. Rick"
554397,Guest,2006-02-06 19:03:00,0,"I would save the evening for the Walleye bite. The trout, if you find them, will bite anytime of day. Finding them is the key. I'd start 12-18 feet along sharp dropping rocky shorelines. You are right about the depth finder for marking fish. They are not deep enough for the cone angle to mark them. It is important for spotting structure though. The Trout& Walleye fishing have gone down hill over the years. I don't want to harp on this but this would not be my first choice for a lake. It sounds like you are set on it and who knows, you might hammer them. One thing is for sure, you won't find a nicer lake or area anywhere."
