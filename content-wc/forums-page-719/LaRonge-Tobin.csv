Fishing was good, but in 10 years a lot can change. I asked about the change (Cornhusker Owner) in the last 10 and was told that the walleye fishing was better than ever, lake trout was great (premimum place to fish is trout narrows just outside of camp) and that the northern had gotten worse - especially the large ones. Exporing where to go this year with ice out. La Ronge or Tobin. I know nothing current about either. At least at La Ronge I have a contact - Tobin I know is known for the big walleye - was also there 10 years ago. Personally, catching good numbers of nice size fish with good scenery is what I'm looking for. Leaning to LaRonge and Cornhusker for ""current"" reports and the setting was much nicer there than where I was at Tobin years ago. Rick"

554204,Guest,2006-01-30 09:33:00,0,"Can you expand what you mean with the ""shield"". Rick"
554205,Guest,2006-01-30 11:02:00,0,"What he means by the shield is it is a Northern Shield lake. Thus the good scenery and sheer rock cliffs. As for the fishing in La Ronge it is one of the ""slower"" lakes we have in Saskatchewan as far as I'm concerned. It would not be my first choice but either would Tobin. My opinion only. La Ronge is a beautiful lake but Tobin is basically a ****ed river. How much are you willing to spend? Drive or Fly in?"
554223,mrwalleye5,2006-01-30 20:21:00,1922,"At ice out at La Ronge, The Saskatchewan River or Tobin as most people refer to it will be starting to get pretty high and fast with the spring runoff. That in turn muddies up the water making the walleye bite somewhat less then mediocre. If you where to go out onto Tobin Lake itself you might be able to scare up some walleye but it can be a hard lake to fish if you are not familiar with it. Hiring a guide for a day or two might help you. Personally my pick would be La Ronge. Can't beat the Canadian Shield scenery and the fresh smell of spruce trees while your slowly poking around looking for fish. Tobin has a kind of feature less shoreline. mrwalleye5"
554235,Guest,2006-01-31 08:42:00,0,"I can't say I know where they are.... but flying in I know would produce better results. This group of 4 is likely looking for the drive in. Again scenery, good friendship and pretty good fishing is what we are looking for. LaRonge and having been there would fit that. However, another drive idea is? Thanks Rick"
554244,Guest,2006-01-31 12:46:00,0,Consider Otter Lake at Missinippe.www.thompsonscamps.com.It would be about an hour farther than La Ronge. You have the scenic rapids and the very good walleye bite at ice out. Usually not trophy size like Tobin but 100+ days are very common in the spring. Try the jet boat ride down the Churchill river rapids.It will be the hi-light of your trip.

554286,Guest,2006-02-01 19:17:00,0,"Have you thought of any other outfitters on La Ronge? Personally, I would go to Hunter Bay Lodge so you can fish Nunn Lake as well. (Connected to La Ronge) Great for walleye, lake trout and northerns. This way if you are having a tough time on La Ronge this is a great option."
