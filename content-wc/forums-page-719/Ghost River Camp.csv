Has anyone been there recently and how is the camp and what type of fishing can you expect. How are the camp owners and are they friendly and helpful? Also drive time, how long does it take to get there from the Twin Cities? Any suggestions and information you can give me will be helpful."

Fishing is pretty good, and there are many bodies of water to fish. We are going back in June. We have been there many times, so we have our favorite spots to fish. You can easily go up there and put 50 walleye in a boat a day. You may not catch a true trophy, but there are many fish in the mid 20's. The main body of water, Marchington lake, is not huge like Lac Suel, so it stays pretty calm and fishable even on the windy days. There is also a pretty healthy smallie population, if you get bored with the walleye. Also, there are lake trout in one of the portage lakes, but it is a pretty far portage. We stay in one of the outpost cabins, and have never stayed in the smaller ones, but we have always enjoyed our accomidations. Some people beleive the owners are a little rude, but I found them helpfull. However, I am the type that just likes to go find the fish myself, and dont really talk to them much. I have enjoyed it enough to go back for the 5th time this year. I think you would probably enjoy it also."

554307,Guest,2006-02-02 21:55:00,0,I have stayed there. The camp owners are fine. The cabins are very adequate. You drive 20 minutes out of Souix Lookout-so about 8 hours from Twin Cities. You boat in-walk around one waterfall to get there-so kind of fun for a kid. There are several short portage lakes to try. All fun for a kid. We don't go back because my friend bought a boat-so we boat ourselves. Probably could catch more on Lac Suel-but if you want an experience as well as fishing-would give it a try.
