We mainly go for Smallmouth Bass, but we also don't mind getting into some of their great walleye fishing on Yoke Lake behind the lodge. It's the best place we have been in the last 9 years Great Food, Cabins, Guides, and Boats. We will be up the last week of June. www.happylandingfishing.com"

553905,Guest,2006-01-19 10:08:00,0,"Sorry that I haven't responded yet. My PC decided to have several bad disk sectors on the hard drive all at once. Two days worth of fixing and getting back to where I was before. Allanwater is a decent, if not rustic, Lodge. You can either fly in with West Caribou or Rusty Meyers, or rail in by train. We've always flown in with Rusty Meyers out of Savant Lake. There is no American plan so you have to bring your own food. The price is good with the total cost of flight, lodge, and liscence around $1000. John and Barney Jelinksi (son and father) are the owners and are good guys. Things may not always be smooth with them, but they don't leave you hanging either. They always work to make your stay the best that they can. Kawaweogama is a good size lake at 5 miles across. The Allanwater River cuts through it, combines with the Brightsand River coming out of McEwan Lake and continues on right past the camp. Your options for fishing are nearly endless with the mouth of the Allanwater River (accross Kawaweogama) being the most consistent. Both lakes are filled with islands and great structure to hold both Pike and Walleye. John and Barney are wonderful in pointing out some good places. It is also a great place to go out on your own for exploratory fishing (check the old fishfinder). I've got several fish in new territory annually. Fish don't get huge, but our group has recorded several fish over 25"" in the past 2 years. Last year, I caught at least 12 over 20"". Catching 18"" or less is no problem. 20-50 fish a day (per person) is not uncommon with some freaky 50+ days thrown in. All types of fishing techniques are applicable from jigging, bottom bouncing and trolling cranks. It is a good place, but really the only one I've been to."
