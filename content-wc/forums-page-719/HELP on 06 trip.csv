553488,lobo1,2005-12-26 20:10:00,734,"Thanks to all for the emails and responses here - I really do appreciate them all. I booked us at Lake St Joe at the Old Post. We're not going to drive too far each day (300-350 miles) so we'll be stopping over night along the way there somewhere near Wawa and T-Bay and on the way home stop in Duluth and somewhere near LBDN / Escanaba, MI - should be a great trip. Still looking for lodging at Wawa/Whiteriver, Duluth and Escanaba areas. Anybody know any cool places to stay at these locals? I can find the Super 8's etc.... Any you guys have any favorite places to stop along the way near these other locations - that may be interesting for a boy (like scenic overlooks, amathyst mines, etc)? feel free to make suggestions here or email me. NWO Fishing Bum - I appreciate your thoughts and somewhat agree but since my wife does not ever complain about me fishing 2-4 times a week most of the year - I think I'll just go with her thoughts on this one. thanks again to all, Lobo1"

553492,jerry bark,2005-12-27 07:29:00,822,"hey Lobo, near wawa is the magpie high falls, a large waterfall with hiking trails/picnic area and fishing opportunities. its north of wawa just a bit. we always stop at the restaurant downtown in wawa, ""olypia"" i think(on the left as you drive into downtown), nice place lots of good food, desserts made daily by the waitress! cheers jerry"
553497,Guest,2005-12-27 12:38:00,0,"We stay at the Bristol in Wawa. It's no Marriott but it's clean and inexpensive. It passed my wife's cleanliness test, so that's a plus. The Columbia restaurant is a good place to eat too in Wawa."
553502,lobo1,2005-12-27 15:27:00,734,"jerry and bw - thanks. I was struggling for wawa options. I have fished on the Magpie before but didnt know of the hiking trails and falls - weather permitting this will be plan ""A"" - I will have to look into it. The only place I been in town was that trading post - which is pretty cool. thanks again Lobo1"
553503,lenray,2005-12-27 16:49:00,467,Hello Lobo I stay at the Bristol when in Wawa--they have shower pressure that will peal skin off your back and hot too. This has been in the winter and the hot water felt good after a day on the sled trail. lenclaremichigan
553507,jerry bark,2005-12-27 19:47:00,822,columbia - olympia?? see i was close. thanks BW that's the place i mean right down town! cheers jerry
553535,DIRTBALL2,2005-12-30 10:42:00,39,"How far away are you from Lac Seul? If you are able to go there, you can't go wrong by going to Lost Island Lodge. Shane and Chris Hayes will knock themselves out to make sure you have a great trip. I think you can drive most of the way there and then take a boat for the remainder. Here's the link: www.lostislandlodge.com Hope you guy's have a ball!!! DIRTBALL2"

553435,lobo1,2005-12-22 18:00:00,734,"Hey guys/gals - looking for some help here. I am looking for recomendations for a drive-in or boat-in type trip for 4-5 days somewhere within a one day's drive of Thunder Bay. We are looking for an adventure - just my 11 yr old and me. We could rough it or take a guided trip but want to catch some good numbers of fish - size doesn't matter so much. We can cook or take meals - very flexible. We could leave as early as june 7th and as late as the labor day weekend....just want to miss the fly hatch. If anyone has some suggestions - I would appreciate it very much. thank you, lobo1"
553439,jigman 2003,2005-12-23 08:00:00,981,"For a fly-in trip you can't beat Mattice Lake Outfitters for quality of service, fishing, and accomodations. They also put together canoe trip packages if you want a true wilderness adventure (better not break your leg, long wait to get help). Don, Annette, Yolanda and Jason are great people to deal with. Here's the website.www.matticelake.com I am sure that you will get other suggestions also. Take your time and look at all of them. That's part of the fun."
553442,lobo1,2005-12-23 10:09:00,734,"I been with Mattice and you are right - they are great people....BUT my wife doesn't want me flying in with our son - so they are out. On our last trip out of Red Lake our pilot died the very next day after dropping us off....one of my friends ""spilled the beans"" to my wife and now she is paranoid. I am thinking really hard about booking the Old Post on St Joseph - I've talked to lots of guys over the years that were going in there when we were at the motel in Pickle Lake waiting for our flight. Heard nothing but good things. thanks lobo1"
553444,jigman 2003,2005-12-23 11:15:00,981,"Not trying to talk you into them, but MLO does offer a paddle-in option via canoe. I know that I am not a canoe fisherman anymore, but with a young son it might be fun."
553447,Guest,2005-12-23 13:11:00,0,"www.tdamisk.com This is where I took my son on his 10th year for a lot of memories. Since you talk about a fly-in but the wife won't let you fly so this is about as close to a fly-in as I think you're going to get. You'll spend an extra day driving to and from but the roads are reliable and not heavily travelled. Limits are more generous than NWO and fishing is first rate. I like to go during the first full week of July by taken advantage of the holiday to burn that extra day driving and take off the friday before to get a jump on the weekend drivers. Usually pull into camp late on Saturday but with enough time to get the boat in the water for an evening of fishing. Note that anytime near June 21 solstice you can expect long days 11:00 pm sunsets and 4:00 am sunrise. I've usually stay till the next Saturday and leave early in the morning to start for home. Can't remember a time we didn't come home with limits of walleye & pike during this time frame. I've had lots of trips in Aug/Sep to NWO, Manitoba, Saskatchewan where either walleyes or pike was just darn hard fishing. One trip in Sept we caught hundreds of white fish for every walleye we put in the boat. It is the best time of year to go because of few bears, few bugs and warm weather, while fishing is still hot for walleyes and just starting up for Pike. This is important because most youngsters want to cast a crankbait rather than working jigs off the bottom. If you have a chance to hire a guide, do it, he can get you onto big walleyes as they move in and out of some slightly deeper water in one of the shallow bays. Physical locations like these can be a devil to find on a body of water this size. Good luck,"
553448,Guest,2005-12-23 13:26:00,0,"I'm confused . . . what is your wife worried about?? Does she think your next pilot is going to die in-flight?? Does she have any idea how many thousands of times more likely you are to die in an accident while driving to the airport than you are in a plane??? If she does, then I guess you can't even leave your house. Put things in perspective for her . . . that should calm her down. NWO Fishing Bum"
553456,lenray,2005-12-23 19:34:00,467,Hello Lobo Trusting you and your family are going to have a Merry Christmas. Ya still keeping the bad guys in line??? Ya asking a good question but you have probably forgotten more good lakes than the rest of us have been to. Take care your neighbor 30 miles up da pike to the west.
553459,Guest,2005-12-23 22:22:00,0,"There are a number of good lodges that are drive in around Sioux Lookout. I have been taking my kids there for the last 3 years and they are 4 and 6 now. there is a hospital in case of emergencies, restaurants, downtown area with an ice cream and coffee shop and with a 20 minute boat ride out on lac seul or minnataki you are away from it all. even though some of the best walley fishin, numbers wise, is right around town. i have had a cabin on big vermillion lake for years and the kids and i did good on smallies, muskie, pike and perch this year. we did real good on the walleyes at dawn and dusk on pelican and abram. not too many bears this year either. we paired up the dates with the local blueberry festival and they had some neat stuff in town the wife liked and the kids had fun with (aug 1-6). let me know if you want to check on any place up there, i can send you the lodges and hotels I have had some experience with in the past. kids always seem to like eating at knobby's as well. lots of taxidermy and there are a lot of float planes coming and going to look at. good luck."
553461,Bx2(IL),2005-12-23 23:14:00,62,"Two recommendations for you lobo1. Both drive in & in range. The first is The Fisheries Resort on Rainy Lake. www.thefisheries.com The other is Waaldhof Bay Lodge on Eagle Lake. www.waldhofbay.com We've had great fishing and good times at both. Check em out, good luck and Merry Christmas."
553462,lobo1,2005-12-24 02:36:00,734,Len - We sure have been blessed to have fished some very good waters over the years. I'm really looking forward to sharing the experience with my oldest son (11 yrs) this year. So many awesome lakes to look into - I really appreciate all the suggestions I am getting from the group here. I will be in your town for one week every month for most of 2006. Supposed to be some sort of community college there that will be hosting a masters program I am enrolled in - maybe we can get lunch someday. Have a great Christmas ! Lobo1
