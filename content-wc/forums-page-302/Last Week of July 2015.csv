We always went earlier in the summer and did well on a shallow bite (5-15 feet). We'd just look for any areas where the wind was blowing into. I'm concerned about locating fish when they've moved into the main lake basin in 20-30 feet water. I know many rely on good fish finders to scan areas before wasting precious time fishing. We'll be using camp boats with depth finders but I'm not certain they will be much use to a novice like myself. We're staying at Onaway which is the only place to stay in my opinion. Blair does his best to point out areas to try but I hate pestering him to give me exact locations. How do I find fish in such a vast amount of water? I know it's early but I'm already pumped. Any pointers would be appreciated."

Find the refs off the islands and look for the Little cuts in the ref. we caught a lot of walleye in them little cuts from 10' to 35'. If you can find ones with sparse weed growth than your in business. Caught a lot of mid 20""ers this way. Just let that floater slid down that cut and get ready."

We fish Bay of Islands, McKenzie Bay, Manitoba Point area, Manitou Narrows and South Inlet. We have had our best luck trolling wind blown islands/points and reefs. Depths this past year ranged from 10-35 feet and it varied day to day. Just have to experiment to find where they are. We mostly used jigs or spinners with minnows or crawlers. We enjoy going this time of year, not too hot and not too cold. You will have a great trip! Good Luck! 9 months to go and the count down is on to our trip to Lac Seul! RBF"
3253633,bus33,2014-10-19 17:39:00,289,We do really well last week in July in 15-20 fow jigging minnows and leeches. Once you find them you can pretty much go back to the same area every day and do well.
