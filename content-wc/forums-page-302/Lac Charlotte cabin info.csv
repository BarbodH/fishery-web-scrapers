3253273,NY Walleye,2014-10-19 13:38:00,78,I've fished both lakes and think Charlotte may be a little small for a 7 day trip. Hebert by far has great fishing and very little pressure. Short trip on Charlotte would be perfect.
3253521,octanehi5,2014-10-19 16:48:00,1104,"Charlotte is the perfect lake to be remote and the only cabin on the lake.I have had times on Lac hebert in the north end,Hammering fish, later in the day being joined by every boat on the island. I have developed a few tricks over the yrs. to keep other fisherman scratching their heads.One of them is being able to anchor in 40+ feet of water. most outfitters do not provide a long rope to do such a thing. I carry an extra 100 feet of rope. we have jigged up walleye in 52 feet of water on Hebert"
3256129,gordy28,2014-10-21 06:22:00,437,Thanks again guys I'm an early planner our next big trip will be 2016 lol But meeting with our group this fri to chat and will be putting forth air tam as a reco I think we'd gravitate towards Charlotte as we loved our first ever rent a lake experience Ah so many places to try but not enough time or budget to hit em all Cheers Gordy
3235209,gordy28,2014-10-11 07:08:00,437,"Hey there Our group is interested in air tamarac lac charlotte outposts Have read many great reviews about air tam, Hebert and the fishing on lac Charlotte but have seen limited info on the cabin. Does it have running water? Showers? Outhouse or indoor toilet? Electricity (generator) or solar lighting? Re fishing in Charlotte. Shot at a 40 inch plus pike? From where we are in Mississauga it's a 12 hour drive to the air base which is attractive Cheers Gordy"
3235753,Mike Borger,2014-10-11 11:22:00,1554,My guess is Hebert itself might suit your needs better Gordy.If you could just get past the need for an indoor toilet I could give you plenty of other fantastic outpost options within a 12 hour drive.
3236249,gordy28,2014-10-11 18:31:00,437,"I hear ya Mike Meeting in 2 weeks for a post trip debrief and start chatting about the next trip My searches lead me to believe the need for an indoor toilet will take us to either White River again or we need to look at Armstrong or Sioux Lookout etc - flying through Thunder Bay My reco to the group will be - if we have a generator, running water and an indoor shower - and ditch the toilet - Nakina becomes an option as does wawa and chapleau Don't worry - as soon as I know you'd be my first pm lol Gordy"
3236353,fishron,2014-10-11 19:59:00,317,"Gordy, this past late June was my groups first trip to Hebert. We did great on walleye for size and numbers but only caught a few pike topping at 36 in. There are pike in Hebert well in excess of forty but we did not target them. Next year....yes. The outhouse situation did bother some of my guys and cut our numbers a bit. I spent many years in scouting and it isn't an issue for me but I must admit that I prefer an early trip when the distance of the seat to the drop zone is greatest. Hebert's cabins are clean, hot showers, good propane fridges, solar lights for the fish cleaning stations, propane lights in the cabins (great ambience), running water and on the Island few bugs and two caretakers that clean the outhouses daily. Air Tam is first class. In my opinion, Hebert offers more but Charlotte gives you a smaller lake to yourself.......Good luck on wherever you end up.....Ron"
3239289,octanehi5,2014-10-13 10:49:00,1104,"Gordy you will do well with air Tam no matter which lake you chose. Cabin on Charolet is only two yrs old,with all the latest tech for outpost camps,It good for 4 guys,Lots of walleye and big pike,This coming yr will be my groups 12th yr on Hebert, Better fishing and accommodations,for the $ can not be beat in Quebec.If you need more info you can e-mail me at [email protected]"
3241553,gordy28,2014-10-14 11:18:00,437,Thanks for the responses - will reach out to Air Tam about Lac CHarlotte as wellEverything I have read about Hebert sounds awesome - but I think we want to continue down the only cabin on the lake path after experiencing it for the first time this past AugustCheersGordy
3244529,Ferrispata,2014-10-15 12:49:00,63,"The Lac Charlotte cabin (like those at the neighboring Lac Hebert) has running water (pumped from lake), an outhouse I believe, showers, fish cleaning hut. No electricity but has propane lights, fridge and most likely a wood stove. This past summer we went to Hebert and loved it. Some day will try Charlotte (much smaller lake, but as said, you would be only ones on lake versus 7 cabins on Hebert, didn't feel too crowded though). Can't go wrong either way. Definitely shot at 40+ inch pike. Here is a link to a youtube clip from some guys that fished lac charlotte in 2013. I know it says Lac hebert but on the Air Tamarac site they have it listed as Lac Charlotte plus the owners told me that it was Charlotte. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIPsnC6u29k Good operation with Tamarac for sure. Good people. Jerry"
3248833,gordy28,2014-10-17 06:37:00,437,"Thanks Jerry Great info and loved the video Have connected w air tam and charlotte has running water, shower, propane lights They will put a generator on site for Cpap machine Cheers Gordy"
3248905,Ferrispata,2014-10-17 06:51:00,63,Glad to be of help. Good to know they can supply a generator for a cpap. One of my crew uses one but he managed without for our trip. We never asked.
3250281,octanehi5,2014-10-17 15:01:00,1104,You will find Eliane and John to be very accommadating. Good Luck on your Trip
