I was young in my teens and didn't know a thing about Walleye fishing, and no electronics my first trip, and easily manged 100-200 walleyes a day. A very beautiful lake. I would love to go back and hope to someday.P.M. me if you would like with any Questions."

So many things wrong. I guess there is a reason Greg and Dan wanted payment up front before we flew to the cabin. There was no way of getting a discount or cash back when we returned and complained about the cabin. We went back to Miniss lake the next year. Miniss river flows from Arc into Miniss. Better cabin. Amazing fishing. Bill"
