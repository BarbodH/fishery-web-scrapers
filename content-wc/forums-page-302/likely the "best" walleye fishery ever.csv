3227881,Juls,2014-10-07 14:40:00,13414,That tournament was back in 2001 wasn't it?
3228473,bigwillies,2014-10-07 20:47:00,515,"guesse fishing is like music.kinda subjective.i have been on lakes in north west ontario were we have caught 40 to 60 walleyes per hour.(two people).nothing huge,but one after another."
3229353,Thompmd,2014-10-08 09:34:00,320,"Hi Juls,If I remember correctly it was in 2002, you were still in HS right.I have been to Erie in March/April and also in October for Smallmouth and that lake is a factory but as you know the wind can be a monster. I am always amazed at some of the small boats you see."
3230785,Whopper,2014-10-08 20:05:00,340,"I'm pretty fortunate I get to fish both Lake Erie and NWO the past fifteen years or so. To me me both are awesome. You don't neccessarily have to troll Lake Erie to catch big fish although it helps put up numbers. I've caught my three biggest walleyes the past year casting an Erie Dearie ""old school"""
3232321,Larry Mac,2014-10-09 15:19:00,530,"Nicely said Jaym, Canadian Wilderness fishing is a true passion of mine and have been blessed to have experienced it on many different levels. That being said:Lake Erie is a World Class Fishery along with being a true environmental success story!!! It is a Walleye factory!!!!P.S. it also happens to have a World Class Walleye and Perch Guide working on it (Juls). The walleye she catches are amazing enough but I have personally seen the pictures of the Jumbo Perch she has been putting her customers on and they are absolutely unbelievable!!!!Thank youLarry Mac"
3232865,Guest,2014-10-09 19:28:00,0,U forgot world class smallmouth fishery! PS most of the fisherpersons on here r trollers so the trolling comment won't fly here lol
3240097,octanehi5,2014-10-13 17:02:00,1104,"The beauty of walleye fishing is in the eye of the beholder, and what type of trip you are on,I too have caught my biggest walleye of my life in the bay of quinte.the trip was great nothing under 7lbs. not far to compare with fly in to a lake that I have a personal best of over 900 in one week. There has to be something said for hooking a fish while jigging 90% of the time, you feel the bite and hook the fish, trolling the fish is almost hooked automaticly in most cases. Feeling the bite and hooking the fish,jigging or casting Just can not be beat. Last season on my favorite Lake Hebert, with air Tamarac, our biggest fish was over 9lbs,our friends in another cabin caught some over 10lbs. hooking a fish of this size on a ultra light or light jigging rod is something you need to put on your bucket list. When the bite is on while jigging ,the fishing can not be beat"
3240161,Juls,2014-10-13 17:28:00,13414,Thanks Larry! It certainly was an incredible season this year.
3225321,Thompmd,2014-10-06 11:53:00,320,"For me ""nothing"" compares to Canada in regards to the entire experience but comparing the quality I don't think any can compare with Lake Erie. I happened onto this and thought it would be interesting to discuss...Three consecutive days of perfect April fishing weather, a rarity on Lake Erie, saw 346 post-spawn walleyes in excess of 10 pounds come to the weighing scales. Ted Takasaki of South Dakota set a one-day PWT record of five walleyes that weighed 53.20 pounds. The total-weight PWT record was set by tournament winner Tommy Skarlis of Iowa, 15 fish that tipped the scales at 138.28 pounds. All told, every fifth fish of the tournament was in excess of 10 pounds, and the tournament average for all walleyes weighed was 7.9 pounds!"
3225465,Skyraptor,2014-10-06 12:47:00,291,"Makes you wonder how many of those walleyes died during the weigh-in or after due to post-truma? In my eyes, nothing compares to Canada because it is not just about big fish but everything else that goes with it."
3225641,Obabikon,2014-10-06 13:58:00,2370,"Even if many of those fish died, it would have almost no affect on Erie. Just a monster walleye lake. I (of course) am biased. I'd much rather eat a 15"" walleye, but there's not doubt... if anyone wants a 10 LB eye... Erie is the best."
3225705,phishfearme,2014-10-06 14:55:00,1242,there's no doubt that this is meat fisherman's heaven - but I find the methods used - troll troll troll with downriggers and planer board then winch in the fish while the boat is still doing 2 knots with waves beating up your stomach was fun for one day but will not do it again. gimme a good Ontario lake anytime. phish
3226433,jaym,2014-10-06 19:22:00,89,I go to Erie to restock the freezer and Canada to restock my sanity
3226569,wallydave,2014-10-06 20:21:00,2151,If I want the meat I buy some fillets at Border Bobs. For the sanity piece Ontario is hard to beat!
3226609,fishanytime,2014-10-06 20:28:00,63,Are those netted walleyes at Border Bob's?
3227537,walleye22,2014-10-07 11:41:00,59,NOTHING beats a Canada fishing trip. Nothing. Period. Nothing. I keep a couple to eat here and there and the small ones for that and catch and release all week long. I do not bring any home anyway. I usually fish alone as well and love that even more.
3227641,Mike Kansas,2014-10-07 12:52:00,1463,Well said phish. Mike Kansas
3227761,fishron,2014-10-07 13:50:00,317,"Years ago, my buddies and I would fish Oswego Harbor, sometimes with a guide and sometimes without. We fished out of walleye boats or at times in a drift boat for stealth. Most of the catching was done after dark. Because the harbor was enclosed in a sea wall we could fish comfortably from smaller craft. We fished in the dark and the lights only went on after a fish hit. We would venture up the Owego river where the lights on either side of the river gave us adequate light. We caught many walleye in the seven to eleven pound range. A bonus of equally large brown trout would occasionally join the catch. Our lure of choice was a nine inch floating rapala. We never keep large walleye anymore but the memory of those big girls years ago will never be forgotten."
