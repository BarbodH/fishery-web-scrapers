3233409,sept61,2014-10-10 06:35:00,91,"Starting to pick up 15 miles north of Selkirk at Breezy Point and the ""Cut""If you plan to fish south hold off, I have only seen one boat in that area all week. I live in Selkirk and have not bothered to go yet.But if you want to avoid the launch circus, now is a good time to come. There was only been 10-15 boats in the lot at the Selkirk Park yesterday and seven the day before. Its been extremely windy and cool for this time of year. The recent strong north winds and draw-down (Oct 14) will help. Currents are still strong to the south."
