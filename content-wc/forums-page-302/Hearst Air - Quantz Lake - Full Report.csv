3167905,MrSimon,2014-09-11 06:00:00,922,"I agree about the 10-15 pound range .... tons of them. I don't know if there are any true monsters though. The water was a few feet down so we didn't try any of the rivers. We only went up to the North end of the lake a couple of times. It certainly is beautiful up there, but we just weren't catching as many fish."
3168545,MrSimon,2014-09-11 09:00:00,922,Here is a slideshow of fish we caught on our trip.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7h3ZyeF2E
3170057,adempsey,2014-09-11 19:11:00,963,I like the idea of the pool noodle to hold your lures!
3170641,MrSimon,2014-09-12 05:59:00,922,"I read it on this forum somewhere. It's a great idea and worked like a charm. Way better than lures bouncing around in the bottom of the boat, or going back into the box wet."
3224401,387loup,2014-10-05 20:13:00,12,"Great report, did you drive to Hearst ? I have a group from PA and MA that would like a trip like that"
3225721,phishfearme,2014-10-06 14:58:00,1242,thanks for the detailed report it would be so nice if every flyin lake in Ontario had a report like this posted on this board - for so many lakes there's nothing. phish
3227521,MrSimon,2014-10-07 11:36:00,922,"Yup, we drove to Hearst. It took us 19 hours from Downingtown, PA. Here is a YouTube slide show of the fish we caught.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ7h3ZyeF2E"
3163633,MrSimon,2014-09-09 11:52:00,922,"We went to Quantz Lake via Hearst Air for a seven day fly-in trip from Aug 29 - Sept 5. I'll give a short summary and then a complete report below that. Here is a video tour of the Outpost.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38Ovp0mAb3ESummary: Hearst Air is a great outfitter. Professional, on time, nice planes. Quantz is a true trophy pike lake that gave up dozens of pike in the 34-43 range for us. Walleye are everywhere and easy to catch, but they don't seem to get all that big. Cabin is well equipped and comfortable. Motors ran great and the boats were acceptable but not great. We had a blast!!!!!!! Full Report BelowHearst Air: I was pleased with how quickly Melanie answered questions via phone or email. Their air base is about 15 minutes West of Hearst and is very nice. We arrived at the base at 6:30AM and the dock hands were quick to weigh our gear and get us loaded up in the Turbo Beaver. Our bait was already waiting for us. They put our check flight stuff in a big freezer and delivered it as promised mid-week. On the way back we were in the Cesna Caravan with Mike V. as our pilot. He was fantastic! He answered lots of our questions and even let the guy in front fly for a bit. Quantz Lake: Quantz isn't a very big lake. Maybe 6 miles from top to bottom and a mile or two wide at the widest part. It seems to be broken up into the northern section and southern section. The northern section seems to be mostly shallow weedy bays and large shallow flats without too much deep water ... seems to be 4-12' in most places. It looks to be the PERFECT pike spawning habitat and I'm sure the North end is loaded with big fish in the Spring. The southern part of the lake has the main basin that can get close to 40' deep in places, but is mostly 8-20' deep. We caught almost all of our big fish in the Southern portion of the lake. We did OK in the North, but it was pretty clear the big fish had moved to the South. There are a handful of islands, bays, rivers, and creeks all over the lake. The lake is NOT rocky. I mean, like REALLY NOT rocky. The bottom is almost completely mud. This lake is all about weeds and breaklines.Pike Fishing: Common knowledge said that late summer pike would be in the deepest areas of the lake relating to deep structure. WRONG!!!!! The big pike were in shallow weeds. Nice green weed beds were the key. River mouths were incredibly productive along with the standard weedy bays. We caught most of them on small to medium spoons and in-line spinners, but also had success with shallow crankbaits, jigs, jerkbaits, spinnerbaits, and even topwater. The pike seemed to really turn on in late morning and again in the evening. Some wind seemed to help a lot too. The fishing was always good, but when they starting feeding it was ridiculous. The pike fishing in this lake is the best I've ever seen ..... by a long shot. Heck, we caught a 40' right off the dock. Largest for the week was a fat 43. I was impressed by how thick and fat the pike were. We had a few low to mid 30 fish that were 10 pounds. Walleye Fishing: Honestly, you can catch almost unlimited numbers of small to medium sized walleye. Since there are no rocks in this lake, its all about bottom breaks. A simple jig tipped with half a worm was far and away the best producer. Every single break we fished held fish. Larger fish came off deeper breaks. We caught a 20.5, 21, and 25 but everything else was between 8 and 16. We also caught a lot of walleye while casting spinners for pike in the weeds. It seemed that the walleye in the weeds were larger ones. We also did really well trolling rattle traps. You can catch walleye all day long, but evenings were far and away the best time. One night we found active fish feeding in 4' of water and it was ridiculous. Nothing big, but constant action. Don't come here if you want big walleye.The Cabin: The cabin was pretty big with three bedrooms (two beds in each one), a kitchen area, and a big eating table. The propane fridge and stove worked perfectly. There is no running water, electricity, or shower. The outhouse was fine. The mattresses were a little funky and not super comfy, but they served their purpose and everyone slept fine. The wood stove was in excellent shape and worked great. There was plenty of firewood, two axes, a very nice propane grill, a fish cleaning table, and two docks. There were plenty of plates, glasses, silverware, bowls, pots, pans, knives, etc etc. They keep the area clear around the cabin which keeps the bugs down and makes for great views. The cabin is located on a huge main lake point. Normally they have two camp lanterns to use, but for whatever reason we only had one. It worked fine, but we could have used a bit more light. The second lantern would have been perfect. We filtered lake water to drink, or used iodine pills and had zero issues.Boats/Motors: They have four or five boats on site with four 9.8HP Nissan fourstroke motors. We ended up using two 16' boats. One was a lund that was dry and solid. The second was a legend that was a bit leaky and had a wet ride in windy weather. The motors are a little on the slow side when pushing these boats, but they are incredibly fuel efficient and you don't really need speed on such a small lake. There are swivel chairs in the boats that have seen better days, but they serve their purpose and are a lot better than having nothing at all. The motors started on the first pull and ran perfect. They would troll at idle all day without a hickup."

3164505,Mike Borger,2014-09-09 16:51:00,1554,"Thanks for the report, Quantz is definitely on my hit list along with Napken."
3164969,adempsey,2014-09-09 20:52:00,963,Looks like a great location! Thanks for the report and video tour.Do you know if there is no running water at all or was it just not operational on your particular trip? Just curious because I thought I saw a tap in your video.
3165209,Mike Borger,2014-09-10 03:33:00,1554,"The only Hearst Air camp that has running water is Pym Island, the rest are more or less identical to what you saw in the video."
3165673,Pymbet,2014-09-10 08:14:00,42,"Excellent summary of Quantz. And I will second Hearst Air being top notch in terms of service. My brother and I were there on a very quickly arranged trip (thanks Melanie!!) from August 22 to August 25 and experienced almost identical conditions and results. The only exception was that we found the biggest pike near some of the deeper holes (we didn't work the weeds too hard). Had two pike hit walleye we were reeling in and landed one (38"") that never let go.What we love about Quantz is that you can get your walleye fix without any effort and then you are free the rest of the day to go for the big ones."
3166033,MrSimon,2014-09-10 10:15:00,922,There is definitely no running water. The faucet on the sink is not operational ..... decoration I guess
3166177,adempsey,2014-09-10 11:25:00,963,"Good to know. Thanks! I think I'd bring paper plates myself though, lol!"
3166241,MrSimon,2014-09-10 11:50:00,922,"We went back and forth on the paper plate thing quite a bit. In the end we decided to save the money and weight, and just wash dishes in the lake. With five guys pitching in, washing dishes took about 5 minutes per day .... and it added to the experience."
3167665,chris.brock,2014-09-11 01:32:00,112,"sounds like you guys did great, that lake seems to pump out the 10 to 15 pound pike, the water was likely low but, did you head north up the river into the next smaller lake?"
