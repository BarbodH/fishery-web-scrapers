Just curious how anyone may have done this fall in the Chamberlain Narrows area. Any areas better than others? I normally would fish from Kekabeka Narrows all the way up to Pecker Point the last week of Sept.Thanks for any updates,PjShorthorn"

Absolutely a fabulous trip. 4 of us caught 1300 walleyes in 7 days, some dandy smallmouths, a 48"" musky and a 42"" northern. Fished from Bear Narrows, south, to Pine Island, North. Fish were mostly from 18' to 26'. All caught on Jig-minnow combination. Chartreuse and gold and silver strobe jigs, 3/8 oz. Water temp was 59 degrees under bluebird sunny skies on Saturday 82 degrees air. Phew! Temps dropped to highs in the upper 40's during the day to low 30's at night. mostly overcast with periods of light rain off and on all the rest of the week but good for fishing. Water temps dropped all week to 53 degrees when we last fished on Friday,(best day with over 250 ""eyes"" for 4 guys). Lots of nice fish. 35 percent of the fish were good eaters under the slot, 35% in the slot and 30 % over the slot with the biggest at 29 1/2"". Numbers were a bit down from years past. but the sizes are getting better every year. Seemed like much fewer boats in the area, no house boats after Sunday, and we were the only cabin booked after Tuesday. Been doing this trip the same week for almost 20 years. Did the N.W. area out of Red Lake the first year and Chamberlain the second and have been going back to Chamberlain ever since. No comparison in my opinion from our experience. More fish, bigger fish, fewer boats. Gearing up for Bay De Noc in a few weeks. Hope this helps. How was your trip to the NW side in comparison?"
