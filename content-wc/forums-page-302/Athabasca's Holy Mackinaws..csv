3262770,Moosebunk,2014-10-24 12:43:00,211,"Thanks DH. Totally on the same page with you, Athabasca is incredibly rich with those sizes of fish, and having been to some other big laker fisheries as well, it not only stacks up in different ways to be an equal, but it's also unique. To describe would take time, but bottom line, pound-for-pound it is world class. Many guests at Lakers are repeat customers for good reason, and by the time I left, the Captain was already 50% booked for 2015.Quote: Originally Posted by skindzierIt was a trip to Athabasca in 1997 that reignited my passion for fishing.

Go away for a week and it's... one, two, three, fifty, a hundred... and so on. A tonne of fun for anyone, but just not quite comparable to a couple hundred lakers 5 to 30 pounds instead. At a place like Athabasca, add the pike (which we didn't fish while there but had heard many of the stories) and you're in for even better times. Typically, with Northern Ontario's finer fisheries for pike an angler can expect to catch if lucky a dozen fish over 40-inches in a week. Many trips that's about the count for a group of four. But these kinds of places anglers can frequently do this in a day. Looking forward to returning to Lakers in the future... and especially want to add some of that pike fishing to the mix come then. jWN... skip the eyes just once bud. Skin... always ignited, those kind of trips are like throwing rocket fuel on the fire. Thanks for reading fellas. Happy the report is being enjoyed."
3266226,Papa eye,2014-10-26 22:55:00,124,Very good report... Been planning for the trip of a lifetime. West coast salmon or fly-in for monster lakers and pike? I think you made up my mind
3270122,Moosebunk,2014-10-28 17:56:00,211,"If seriously choosing a ""BIG laker and BIG pike combo"" for a great price, you'd be hard pressed to better Athabasca. There are certainly many, many quality fisheries in the north for both species, but prices do range from expensive to taking out a second mortgage. With Lakers Unlimited I'd go earlier season than we did, and possibly choose a Spring Bay & Johnston Island combo trip. That way you'd get to sample the best of both worlds up there. Of course, call them first to talk over options and timing."

3251865,Moosebunk,2014-10-18 10:41:00,211,"Thanks for your reply Rich and good to know you've enjoyed other reports as well. Appreciated. Truth be told, I'm no dentist actually. The other dentist fella in the report was. I'm an RN though, working in and out of several ER's as well as contracting in remote northern areas. Attention to detail is a must in my work, and it spills over into everything in life. Take care."
3252417,chris.brock,2014-10-18 19:47:00,112,"this is a walleye forum Bunk, we have no interest in seeing your pictures of giant lakers and rugged country, and hearing your stories of roaming Windigos some people talk about stuff, some people dream about stuff, Bunk actually does stuff!"
3252849,Golden Eagle,2014-10-19 08:14:00,2642,"Thanks, Bunk. No wonder fishing magazines and fishing TV shows are on their way out, since they constantly are being out done by reports such as yours. Seems that producers would try to hire their competition, but maybe they'll continue to stumble along as usual."
3255233,MikeinMN,2014-10-20 16:59:00,190,North to Cree Lake is another very similar book by the author of Face the North Wind if you didn't get enough of their stories. They are two of my all-time favorite books.
3255761,Moosebunk,2014-10-20 20:35:00,211,"Thanks Chris. I wanna actually frame this quote some place, it's awesome and appreciated bud! And... I never really thought about the ""walleye"" in ""Walleye"" Central. Just figure people who like fishing walleye, like fishing. But maybe it'd be better to just stick with walleye posts only round there here parts.Quote: Originally Posted by Golden EagleThanks, Bunk.

Personally I'd watch my brand of fishing show.. probably find it interesting enough. lol. Wouldn't be any commercials either...

Just finished The Orenda and it was one interesting fictional/factual look into historic Canada as well. Happy the report was enjoyed. Thanks guys."
3258673,dhottle,2014-10-22 09:03:00,163,Bunk I enjoyed your report. I have been going to Lakers @ Athabasca since 1999. I think the laker population between 20-40 lbs is the best in North America. Great pike fishing as well. Your comment about Bruce (Ryan) and the guides is spot on . They are the best you will find anywhere. Keep the reports flowing. We all enjoy them.
