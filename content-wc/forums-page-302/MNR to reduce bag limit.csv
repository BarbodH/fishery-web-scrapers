1820905,10point,2013-05-30 08:20:00,102,I guess I will continue to fish for smallmouth. I am basically fishing on a conservative license because I buy a sportsman license but don't buy a license for my Son and his limit counts towards mine so we basically already have a 2 fish limit so unless I buy him a license it would be only 2 between both of us which I don't like.
1821009,skap,2013-05-30 08:40:00,58,"I guess I would be fine with the 2 daily with possession of 4. It wouldnt deter me from going 2-3 times a year either way. I will say though that I would probably be a little crabby if we could only bring home two. I dont think we need more than 4 either though. Its nice to have a meal with the family at some point after we get back home.Canada isnt really about what you can bring home, if that was the case then 4 is probably too small of a bag limit and few would go. You would be better off staying in MN and fishing. It always has been about the experience. I will say though if they go to a two limit for both it would be nice to see the cost of the licenses go down."
1821025,115 optimax,2013-05-30 08:46:00,650,"X2.It's sad,but some people do keep 30"" Walleye to eat."
1821033,drlee,2013-05-30 08:47:00,409,"Just a couple of thoughts...first, we have moved on from keeping only 16"" to 17"" fish and now keep more in the 15"" range. Two per day per guy? I guess you have never met my grandson, who is 6'2"" and 265 pounds as an offensive tackle at the college level (next fall). A 15"" male compared to a 17"" walleye...quite a difference in the size of the fillets. Secondly, we like to have some fish in reserve for dinner, since some days are faster/slower than others. Yes, its a convenience, but the guys I fish with really want a big walleye dinner every night in camp. As to taking fish home, I would give that up in a heartbeat. If I could keep 4 per day while in Canada and not take any walleyes home, I would be fine with that. Other guys in our group like to have 2 for shore lunch and then 2 for dinner. Guess that would not be possible under the proposed legislation. Anyway, these are just personal thoughts. If the law changes, so be it. I would adjust and NEVER give up my Canada trips."
1821089,GNO,2013-05-30 09:09:00,153,"There was a lot of data presented for the council. Here is a link to the full background report. Everyone may not agree on how the data was interpreted, but lots of data was offered.http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/stdprodcons...rod_093015.pdf Got this from Sarah Campbell's site - what does she propose then? While Campbell noted the Ministry has an important role to play in conservation, she stated that if it were properly fulfilling its mandate to conserve and plan ahead, there would be no need to change these limits. I understand the need to protect fish stocks, said Campbell, but the MNR is a Ministry designed to prevent these things from happening and they have clearly failed to do so."
1821121,Mike Kansas,2013-05-30 09:23:00,1463,"Canada is a gift from God to all of those who are able and lucky enough to enjoy time in a boat fishing with friends and family. Anything that is done with the intent of preserving the fishing for the future is good with me. In the 58 years I have been going to Canada I have seen many changes in regards to limits, size and slot limits and in my opinion the changes have been benificial to the quality of fishing. Todays fishing is at least equal and maybe even better than it was 58 years ago and I for one want future generations of fisherman to experience what I have been fortunate to enjoy the last 58 years. Mike Kansas"
1821153,elway12,2013-05-30 09:28:00,335,"Very interesting and good thread. Many good points. Especially Skap and Vgord. I would still go to Canada and believe others generally would as well but here is a couple of other thoughts. I think many more fisherman who are not on WC are the type that only get to go up north once a season and maybe not every year and to them I think the importance of eating and being able to take some(who knows how many - it is relative) home is probably more important than many on here realize. I would also add that I think limits should be relative to the lake/water. Some lakes have many people/resorts fishing them hard during the open water/""summer"" seasons & some also during the winter. Other lakes are only fished in the ""summer"" and might have only one small resort on them. Logically thinking these are big factors to consider since the amount of fishing pressure can really dictate the overall health & sustainability of the fish population. Though sometimes difficult, I think it would be smart to look at the body of water and have specific limits vs. ""one size fits all"" regulations. I also know there are many resorts making/encouraging there own regulations to better serve their bodies of water for the future. I think that this is an excellent way of ensuring the lakes have enough for all of us and future generations. Lastly, again I question why have 2 sets of limits(resident vs non-resident)? Seems to me it hurts your desired outcome? Just some thoughts."
1821185,Da' Walleye Assassun,2013-05-30 09:34:00,358,I have seen the limits go down and the licenses continue to go up. No one has been able to explain the Outdoors Card to me. More and more resorts close down as the amount of fishermen decrease. It's similar to the United States post office. The stamps continue to go up at a time when less and less people use the post office. Now I receive catalogs by Fed-Ex. Ontario needs to require a card for fishermen using cabins and resorts. It could be called the Indoors Card.
1821297,Medds1,2013-05-30 09:51:00,18,"I as well have no problem with changing the daily limit to two and possesion to four. The problem I have is the people on here saying that the nonresident is coming up to fill their coolers. Apparently you do not have a very big cooler if you are able to fill it. I will eat about 10 walleyes over the three trips up to Canada. I do find it easier to take those three trips when I bring a meal of fresh fish home for the wife and kids. With this law only affecting the Nonresident I know there will will be guys in my group that will not return, make it across the board or not at all. Our group size was finally getting back up to the 10-15 member size now that they changed the border crossing rules, with this change we will be back down to 4-6. Being turned back at the border has left a bad taste in the mouths of many and now that they are able to get back into Canada things were looking good, this brings the taste back for them."
1821337,farmnfish,2013-05-30 10:03:00,130,"Its not going to change whether I go or not. If for conservation you'd think the change would apply to residents also. An american can feel a bit ""harvested"" after visiting Canada anyhow. But I can't get that kind of fishing down here. Perhaps as a bit of revenge we can limit the snowbirds going to Florida to one bikini babe oggle a day."
1820473,Pooch,2013-05-30 06:01:00,4619,"I would think that the fellows that say they ""will stop going to Canada"" to fish if the limit is changed really won't quit coming just because the take home limit has been reduced.I don't know anyone who doesn't fish Canada more for the experience than a cooler full of fish to take home. Taking home a couple of fish isn't the point. If so, them are some really expensive fillets.Another reason some guys go to Canada is that the fishing below the border has declined most likely to over harvest over the years. It would be sickening to see that happen in Canada, too.I'm pleased to see the MNR being proactive on limits. Anything less would be short sighted.Like others said, ""we got used to the change from a six to four limit"". Fishing seems to have gotten better in the +- 15 years since that change.Pooch"
1820513,v-bay gord,2013-05-30 06:14:00,3168,"I'm all for conservation measures, and here on Eagle lake we have supported changes in the past (ie..slot size, night fishing ban, sanctuaries, etc). These have all worked, and have resulted in a much improved fishery. In this case (the proposed daily limit reduction), the rule has been in place along the border for many years, yet the MNR cites declining walleye populations in some lakes. The solution? Extend the same regulation to the entire zone. My question....if it hasn't worked where it was already implemented then why extend it? Perhaps the thinking is that the average angler (non resident only) eats four walleyes per day......I don't see this logic. For my guests the change will do nothing for improving the fishery on Eagle Lake........they will still be able to take home the same number of fish, if they wish. One question to those that think they can live with it, and already buy a conservation license. What if a conservation license only allows you a one fish daily limit....two in possession rule? I don't think that will be popular. The bottom line is the decision is being made with little to no biological data to support the change. As one MNR District manager told me......"" We need to be seen to be doing something""!! Doing something about what? My experience is that most fisheries have been improving due to some past sound management decisions......decisions that didn't single out one user group. Sorry for the rant.....but I'm irritated. .....by the way, I'm heartened to see the positive response to supporting conservation measures......I just don't think singling out non-resident anglers, with a decision based on little to no biological data, will solve any problems."
1820521,MN_Moose,2013-05-30 06:15:00,964,"I would agree with most that 2 & 4 is a good limit. The problem I have with such regulations is having different regs for residents and non residents. If the reasoon for reducing possesion limits is due to protecting the natural resource it needs to be applied across the board. As far as what impact strict posession limits have on resorts, look at the resorts on the Winnipeg river. The rules were changed for non residents only. It has hurt those camps on the Winnipeg."
1820577,515,2013-05-30 06:36:00,254,I'm quite impressed with the positive attitude of all the posts so far. I'm all for protecting the great fishery we have and hope to enjoy it forever.
1820617,weston,2013-05-30 06:47:00,18,"Those 2 fish daily limits were set to prevent non residents from fishing one day only and not spending any tourism dollars. Extending that to areas that are impractical to travel/fish to and from in one doesn't make any sense. I don't see this change as doing anything to the fishery or the camp owners. Personally as a guide and outfitter I would like to see catch and release , shore lunch only on all the waters, but that will never happen."
1820633,Bigstorm,2013-05-30 06:52:00,799,"We usually dont keep more than 1 walleye per day per guy anyway, That just enough for dinner each night so going from 4 down to 2 per day wouldnt matter to me. I would be dissappointed if they changed the possession limit to 2 though. Since I only get up there once a year, its nice to bring home 4 so I can have them at home from time to time."
1820641,MrSimon,2013-05-30 06:54:00,922,"Like most others, I think lower creel limits is a great idea. I also think that article is a bit off base .... conservation efforts are not going to hurt the tourism industry .... in the long run, it will help it. Sure, it might turn away some cooler-fillers, but maybe that's a good thing. I also think a maximum size limit is important. Even more important than lower creel limits. I'd rather see someone keep six 14"" walleye than one 30"" walleye. Ideally, I think a 3 fish per day rule with a maximum size of 16"" would be perfect. Can you imagine what the fishing would be like in five years if that was instituted across Ontario?!?!?"
1820665,tv4fish,2013-05-30 07:04:00,2694,"Gord: I agree completely with you (and - an excellent post, I might add).Until and unless ""somebody"" can come up with some good, solid FACTS to show this would be beneficial - they'd better put it on the back burner.Change - just for the sake of change - is worthless."
1820673,NathanH,2013-05-30 07:05:00,697,"I fished the Canada Side of Rainy Lake last year, and the Limit was one Walleye per day and you could take home two. Had a great time with my Dad and we plan to return to the area for many years to come. We had some friends who stayed on the US side the same year and I think the limit was 6-8 walleyes per day. When we got back they had caught very few fish and had such a bad time they vowed never to return. I guess for me I'm just happy to have a meal of fish every day and return home with an empty cooler.Also the regulations when were were there in May said you couldnt keep a smallmouth larger then 13.8 inches and Pike had to be 27 inches and under or over 38 or something like that. So really tight regs. It just was not a lake for meat fisherman I guess. But the one other group in camp did work hard to get all their fish to take home. Which is fine by me to each his own. I was just glad that they were restricted to the small fish. Being from WI and living in MN I have watch certain populations just destroy the fishing by keeping everything they can. I am happy to know that there are places like Canada that seem to understand the importance of conservation."
1820873,nitrodude,2013-05-30 08:14:00,60,"It seems to be punitive legislation with no basis in the biosphere. It will not impact me in the least as I fly in and out and keep no fish for travel, but by enacting laws only affecting the tourists without any ecological basis, overall restrictions, or any impact on native harvesting and tactics, many will just see this as a tourist penalty. It just doesn't read as the friendly, welcoming Canada that I've grown to love over these past 20 years of trips to Northern Ontario. I hope it doesn't hurt the outfitters, but since we only have one or two walleye meals in our ten days up it really won't impact my group other than the unwelcoming vibe of targeted legislation."
1819169,bluegussler,2013-05-29 17:47:00,124,"From CKDR in Dryden: A Ministry of Natural Resources proposal to reduce daily catch limits from four walleye to two for non-resident anglers will hurt camp owners. So says Kenora-Rainy River MPP Sarah Campbell. Speaking in the Legislature, Campbell stated the MNR is designed to prevent fish stocks from diminishing and they have clearly failed to do so. Campbell says the reduction will force some tourist camps to close and is urging the government to review its decision. Campbell stresses the proposed reduction in fish limits added with the closure of Travel Information Centre's is killing tourism in the area. She calls the decisions a slap in the face to northerners and the tourism industry."
1819273,v-bay gord,2013-05-29 18:23:00,3168,"Actually the proposal is for a daily limit of 2, 4 in possession. Makes little sense and hopefully will not happen."
1819305,wallydave,2013-05-29 18:28:00,2151,They can check with MNR to see how many Sportsmen licenses are sold compared to Conservation each year. There are camps that include a conservation license in their rates. If they make the change it wouldn't keep me from fishing Ontario if the change improves the fishing! Any thoughts?
1819329,GNO,2013-05-29 18:41:00,153,55% of the non resident licenses sold in FMZ5 are conservation licenses.

Not judging anyone, but I would rather bring home good memories then a cooler filled with fish. I have no problems with the limit as long as I get to fill my belly a few times while at camp with fresh walleye!"
1819457,Curryale,2013-05-29 19:10:00,50,I find it pretty hard to believe that reducing the daily limit would force tourist camps to close. Sounds like a lot of bad logic to me. I would bet not too many places closed when limits were reduced from 6 to 4.
1819809,Smallmouth Hunter,2013-05-29 20:25:00,84,"That's a the rule on Lake of the Woods already. Has been for lots of years, maybe 6 to 8 years. 2 daily 4 total. Not an awful rule. It works."

1820433,2746,2013-05-30 05:37:00,3206,"I also get the conservation license and those numbers would be acceptable to me. However, there would be a small percentage of fishermen who would stop coming up (5 - 10%?). If your a camp owner that could mean the difference between making the payments and not. Any decline in numbers when your trying to grow an industry is difficult and I'm guessing recreational fishing is a big part of the economy. I'm not a biologist but have seen all the Canadian lakes we fish (LOTW, Eagle, Lac Seul, Gullrock) improve over the years with current slots and bag limits. I've seen no sign that the population is suffering in any of these lakes. I wonder, does the MNR have other statistics that are concerning them?"
