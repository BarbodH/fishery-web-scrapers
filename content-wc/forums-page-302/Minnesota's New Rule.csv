Each item, boat, trailer, etc., etc. requires AIS Awareness Training. Once completed, you get a credit card type document (hard plastic). Possession of this document is required (like a drever's license) whenever you are transporting these items. You only need one document, take only one awareness session ( every 3 years if that's what is best) and you can buy 10,000 watercraft if you like and only need one training session and one document that proves you're smart (well maybe) when it comes to AIS..

As stated earlier, even if compliance is only 26% at this point, that's still way better than when this program was started and the percentage will continue to go up every year. A ""FEE"" is not going to do anything to ensure compliance any more than the posters at the boat ramp. All this ""fee"" is doing is lining the pockets of the company administering this and the politicians."

If not, we all deserve what we get. We should all be out there educating people as well, rather than just throwing in the towel. This, to me, is a more gentle approach, than requiring inspection and decontamination at every boat launch. But that is what we'll get if the more gentle approach doesn't work. That will come with scheduled hours at the boat launch. This isn't going away and will get much worse if we don't all take personal responsibility. So have your pick, the gentle approach now or the more onerous approach later.People of the caliber here should be in the forefront of mitigating this problem. We should all endeavor to talk to offenders we see before the more onerous possibilities come to fruition and they surely will if we don't support initiatives designed to stop this.Frank"

3157897,roscoe33,2014-09-07 00:04:00,653,"Anyone that boats or fishes has been informed about invasive species. The info is at every launch site. It is in the boating regulation book you get when you register or renew. It is in the fishing regulation book you get when you buy your license. Non-compliance is a choice, and being told ""one more time"", isn't going to get some bozo to comply. Every year as I pass through MN, I see several boats, ( even some from MN), that have the plugs in. This year, I saw 10 boats with the plugs in, while eating lunch near the MN/CA border. So, if you want to do an inspection or boat boil at every state line crossing and boat ramp, do it. But don't impose penalties on people passing through, especially since they will be unaware of the law in MN. I see boat confiscations on the radar. I think it will be interesting to see how this may play out."

I totally agree with you. The guys and gals on this site are, in my estimation, the responsible ones, at least at the boat launches I attend. The ones that do not care or at least are not aware are the ski boats, pontoons, and weekend warriors who don't remove the weeds hanging on their trailers, don't pull the plugs for the drive home, etc. The fishermen that I am observing are all cleaning their boats, flushing the live wells and pulling the plugs."
3161897,Flip Silverlake,2014-09-08 19:32:00,645,I have it on good authority that Minnesota is going to revisit this issue. They are going to concentrate on launch sites to make sure boats are clean. Guys pulling through Minnesota shouldn't have anything to worry about. I think the intend was good but the legislation may have gone to far. That being said make sure if you launch in Minnesota you clean your boat and all drain plugs are pulled.
3161905,BreezyPoint,2014-09-08 19:35:00,1581,"That would be a more reasonable approach, which I would agree with. I never for a minute felt they would enforce this for boats traveling through the state.Frank"
3161929,BreezyPoint,2014-09-08 19:41:00,1581,"Just a note that I have seen a lot of 'violations', but rarely do I see it from a fisherman. Most of the 'weekend warriors' with party boats, pontoons, and jet skis are the most egregious violators, just like the people who have no clue about launch site courtesy. They just don't use their boats enough to have a clue. I would be happy to see them tagged. The reason I liked the education program was that it would remove all excuses and open the way to the big fine.Frank"
3149881,v-bay gord,2014-09-04 06:01:00,3168,"I would agree and am dismayed with some of the attitudes of people posting on this thread and all others that deal with invasive species and access. Seems peoples interpretation of their ""rights"" trumps environmental damage. Any effort to address the issue by education or other means seems to be an affront to these ""rights"". So whether the sticker idea works or not I at least applaud the state of Minnesota for making some attempt to address the problem. I don't see it as a right, but a privilege to enjoy some of the resources we all share in common."
3150177,Obabikon,2014-09-04 07:21:00,2370,"V-Bay... I (of course) am all for attacking the invasive species issue head on. However, a sticker does nothing to help prevent it. They should be enforcing it in other ways. Additional MNR/DNR officers to check to make sure. Road checks, and if the plug is in the boat... MAJOR fines. Check at the border for goodness sake. I've crossed many times with boats, and not once has the officer checked to see if the plug was pulled. Sure, they might ask, but not one walks behind and looks. They could do an add campaign... put up billboards, signs, literature.... all these would be viable options to fight the problem. Forcing everyone to have a Minnesota sticker on your car is silly."
3150273,BreezyPoint,2014-09-04 07:41:00,1581,"Obabikon, they have done ad campaigns and there are posters at every landing and inspectors at popular launch sites. They still have 26% non-compliance rate. They also have fines up to $500. Now they are trying personal education and giving people a one year pass on fines related to the education. Once the personal education is done, I believe the fines will be routinely assessed. That will finally get people's attention. And as I have stated before, I want to see this problem slowed in every way possible.Frank"
3150473,v-bay gord,2014-09-04 08:33:00,3168,I agree too. The reaction from folks over something minor like this sticker just shows me that they aren't ready for what will really work. I think some sort of permit showing that your boat has been decontaminated for use in a particular water body would be somewhat of a more serious approach.
3151009,srj,2014-09-04 09:52:00,971,"Funding stands in the way of any ""serious approach"". Most of the invasives have arrived via ocean going ships. Perhaps the ships should be footing the bill via a surcharge for invasive actions. Any physical process will be very, very expensive. I still have a couple invasive species stickers on trailers the DNR issued a few years ago. Talking about this subject with a group of fishermen recently, one suggested a law be passed to forbid turtles from changing locations from one water body to another. Also he thought all shore birds and waterfowl should have the same rules. It seems unlikely that further spread can be prevented but may be slowed. V Bay, are any of your Canadian lakes close to the great lakes infected with invasives other than spiny water fleas?"
3151033,trapper_john,2014-09-04 09:58:00,83,"My idea would be to add the fee to all fishing licenses issued to fish in MN. I surely wouldn't be launching my fishing boat in MN if I didn't intend to fish, and for that I would have to buy a license. Leave the people that are just pulling their boat across to get to another state alone."

3151201,BreezyPoint,2014-09-04 10:24:00,1581,"It's not a fee to be added to the license. It's a fee to pay for education on invasives. As such, adding it to the license does nothing to educate people. As far as enforcement for out of staters, I would bet that they give a warning the first time (even after that first year expires) and then enforce the next time around.As far as invasives in Ontario, the rusty crayfish have devastated the weed beds in Lake of the Woods. Some people would consider smallmouth an invasive species. They are fun to catch, but chow down on the walleye fry as well. I often wonder if the explosion of smallmouth in Mille Lacs has something to do with that lake's problems.When invasives (foreign species) are introduced to ecosystem things happen, sometimes good, but most often bad. It's like shock treating the system. It's like speeding up evolution thousands of times. The ecosystem has no time to gradually adjust and change and no way to defend itself.Frank"
3151313,dutchboy,2014-09-04 10:53:00,5717,"Quit calling it a fee. It's a TAX. If you want to own a boat we will TAX it when you buy it, we will TAX it when you buy gas for it or tow it, we will TAX any items used with it. Finally, if you want to bring it out of the garage and pull it around town we will TAX you."
3151321,BreezyPoint,2014-09-04 10:55:00,1581,Sorry Brian. It's a fee. Taxes go to the government. This fee goes to the company providing the education.Frank

3138761,BreezyPoint,2014-08-31 08:27:00,1581,I for one would like to see this at the Ontario borders. I think zebra mussels would be a disaster for the shallow water walleyes in Sabaskong. Eurasian milfoil would be a similar disaster for the way we fish muskies there. I don't care how long it takes and if they charged a fee to defray the cost.Frank

I have to believe that this will cause a lot of confusion and makes no sense to make out of state travelers that will not launch into Minnesota waters to have this sticker. It serves no purpose, and only benefits the firm that came up with this AIS training. No money goes to Minnesota. I used to live in Minnesota, but I will never put my boat in Minnesota waters with stupid laws like these."

But, NONE of the money is going toward the problem, look for yourself, the money is going to the 'Company"" that is administering the class!Follow the money.....and I'll bet you next month's paycheck a large percentage of that same money is finding it's way into the coffers of the politician and political party who first came up with this ""Grab""."
3145585,BreezyPoint,2014-09-02 19:05:00,1581,"Well, I am not particularly interested in where the money goes. But I am at least interested in slowing this down and it seems like a very large % of boaters are ignoring basic 'hygiene' so making them learn a little won't hurt. A 26% non-compliance rate is way too big (that's what it is in Minnesota). A lot of posters just say throw in the towel, but I think it is very short-sighted. Rusty crayfish first appeared in Lake of the Woods in 1960 and it took 35 years (around 1995), but now almost all of the weed beds are gone in Sabaskong Bay, totally changing the way we fish for muskies. I used to love fishing the weedy pocket bays, but they are mostly gone. These are biological systems and we won't know the real effect for many years, just like the rusty crayfish in Lake of the Woods. I see boats all the time dragging weeds on their trailers. I don't think it is too much to ask people to be careful and good stewards of their waters.Frank"

3135809,Flip Silverlake,2014-08-29 22:26:00,645,The state of Minnesota has passed a regulation that requires anyone pulling a boat trailer in the state of Minnesota to take a class and spend $5.00 for a permit that attaches to your boat trailer tongue. This is just to drive through the state even if you do not launch there. Here's the website if anyone is interested.www.trailers.mndnr.gov You have to renew it every three years and pay another $5.00. Any opinions about this out there???
3135849,Guest,2014-08-30 01:23:00,0,"Well, I predict a pizzing match, likely between Ontario and MN, much like they had a few years back. ""You mess with my tourism revenue, I'll mess with yours."" As it now appears on the website, the trailer gets a sticker, but what about the driver / owner? What if I lend my boat to a friend? What if I hop the border into MN and buy a boat? This faq is interesting: I just found out about this and can't take the class before I transport my boat. What can I do? You can register for the class and get a temporary pass that gives you 7 days to complete the training. Ummm, yeah, I'll be in Canada for 9 days, how am I going to complete the course within 7 days? My opinion? Waste of time. Enforce the laws that are on the books now. Will do little to nothing to prevent invasive species from spreading. Will hurt tourism in MN and Ontario. Hmmm, maybe Iowa, Wisconsin, North Dakota, and South Dakota will impose a wheel tax for non commercial trailers in retaliation."

Several of the states out west had mandatory stops for anyone trailering a boat to check for invasive species. I guess overall I'd rather spend $5 every three years than stop and spend the amount of time it would take to get checked. It does show how much of a problem invasive species are to our waters."

If your going to put your boat in any Minnesota water then get the sticker, if not don't charge me a fee just to drive through the state.

I think they believe it's a great way to protect the state from the invasive species problem."
