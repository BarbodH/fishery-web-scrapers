3263162,Mike Borger,2014-10-24 17:05:00,1554,That's awesome I figured everyone just looked at the pictures.
3264514,vaquero01,2014-10-25 17:33:00,101,Or rod and reel.I actually emailed him about his rod and reel that he has used on several trips. He replied. New wish list.

3254657,retire55,2014-10-20 10:15:00,1029,Hi Mike: Thanks for putting your report together to share your adventure. Great presentation and content.
3255609,Pikeslayer8,2014-10-20 19:45:00,1460,"Lets recap SoloPaddler's summer now shall we! First was Missing Lake, followed by Dayohessarah, N. Caribou, Ashewig River, John's Lake, Apisabigo and now capping off the season with a magnificent trip to Whitewater. What a fun trip it must have been! This is by far my favorite report of the bunch. You know the Brookies have been cute and all, but give me big pike to drool over any day! I was completely awed by the pictures and video, both before and after, of the Wendell Beckwith Cabins on Best Island. Cryin shame what happened. Did ya get to check out Ogoki Lodge?If Whitewater were the crown jewel they'd a named the park Whitewater Provential Park. As it is, Wabakimi is the crown jewel of this park. Lol"
3255785,Mike Borger,2014-10-20 20:39:00,1554,"Bill, you forgot the best trip of the bunch, the Sutton River!!! Nothing topped that one.It's been a remarkable year for sure. Exciting for me is I think my 2015 season will be even better. Some of the destinations on tap are pretty cool. I've always valued experiences far more than things so in that respect I'm a rich man.You're right they named the park Wabakimi, but I've seen both lakes and my vote goes to Whitewater. There's a reason Wendell Beckwith deduced it was the center of the universe.I did visit Ogoki Lodge and perhaps should have included it in my write up. Very interesting. If anyone's interested you can see some photos of it here:http://www.canadafishingguide.net/fo...history/#p1096"

3257217,Guest,2014-10-21 15:54:00,0,"Great Report Mike, thanks! Just added another lake to my bucket list. I've fished Ontario for many years with Canadian Fly-in Fishing out of Red Lake. It's been a while, but they had access to 10 lakes with one (usually) or two cabins on each. Beautiful country. Fabulous walleye fishing and great cabins. For monstrous Northern Pike, it's Wollaston Lake Lodge in Saskatchewan for me, hands down. My buddy and I caught 60+ Pike, 15 over 40"" and I landed a 48.5"", 31 lb monster in 3 days!!!!! While there, another guest took a 51"" Pike on a fly rod. The lake is also a trophy Lake Trout, Walleye and Grayling destination... so guests can easily land a grand slam if desired. 5 star people, guides, cabins, custom Lund boats, gourmet food and a Turbo Prop (Beaver?) to fly you into the the remote parts of the lake if you'd like. Mike Lemke is the owner. You guys should meet or at least speak. It's not cheap, but is worth every penny. HIGHLY recommended!"
3257297,Mike Borger,2014-10-21 16:36:00,1554,"Wollaston sounds amazing, maybe I will talk with Mike Lemke!I had a trip to Cree Lake in Saskatchewan cancelled the last two years, I need to rectify that situation."
3259545,Mike Borger,2014-10-22 16:55:00,1554,"Just have to say I had a quick look at the Wollaston website. It does look incredible, but it's $9395 per person for an 8 day trip LOL! Maybe one day."
3262786,vteye,2014-10-24 12:49:00,812,Am i the only one who reads Mikes post just to learn how to catch more fish? Great trip reports and enjoy reading about the techniques.
3252129,Mike Borger,2014-10-18 13:46:00,1554,"In mid September my group of 4 travelled north to fish Whitewater Lake with MLO north of Armstrong Station. Considering the number of fly in trips I've done it was kind of surprising I've never fished with them before. Surprising because of the glowing reviews this particular outfitter always receives.The trip was a huge success! The cabin we stayed on at Whitewater was easily the nicest I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying on a remote fly in, and that's saying a lot!We were there to hunt for trophy pike and ultimately we caught them although we did have to adapt and change our tactics.Walleyes when we fished for them were plentiful and easy to catch. What was really nice was one of the best spots was a long sand bar almost directly in front of the camp. There were always fish to be caught there but they really moved onto it en masse in the evening. That made for some fun and easy fishing for us after dinner most nights.Also worth mentioning was a visit to Wendell Beckwith's cabins on Best Island. I'd been to this very same spot back in 1995 when I paddled the Ogoki river system and it was a trip revisiting the place.In general I can't say enough about MLO! Can't believe it took me this long to book a trip with them and it definitely won't be the last!For anyone who's interested I posted a detailed account of the trip complete with numerous photos and embedded video clips. You can see the full write up here:http://www.canadafishingguide.net/wh...of-the-giants/Cheers, Mike"

3252329,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2014-10-18 18:16:00,629,"Very well done! Brought back memories of my Fall of 2000 trip with Don & ""Mattice Outfitters"". Not the same lake, but still the same quality of fishing & facilities provided by the outfitter!!! Just wish LOTW this season would have been better!! Between the high water, flooding & an abundant supply of wind, it became labeled as my worst season in 15 on the US side!! May have to renew my desire to explore other parts of Ontario.Nice job, set the hook, CRJohn"
3252825,Golden Eagle,2014-10-19 08:06:00,2642,"A real beauty, that I enjoyed while eating breakfast before heading out on the water for the 9th and final day of my current fishing trip. Trips like the one you took, and the one I'm finishing, make life better and perhaps a little longer. Thanks for putting together an outstanding report of your venture. You are right on about enjoying the freedom to do as you like when visiting up north. Being the only fisherman on a lake is rewarding."
3253041,Mike Borger,2014-10-19 09:42:00,1554,"Thanks a lot guys, glad you liked!Connie you're an inspiration. I can only hope I'm still doing the same when I'm your age.Enjoy your time up there and stay safe!"
3253121,pjshorthorn,2014-10-19 11:19:00,5654,Mike: I enjoyed reading about your trip. Thanks so much for sharing. I've never been on a fly-in trip over all the years of going to Canada and this one really peaks my interest. The chance to catch a trophy northern draws me towards a place like this. Nice job.
