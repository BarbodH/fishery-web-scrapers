3196762,JAY221,2014-09-23 09:12:00,877,"I would just add to ask & make sure that they want to go on the trip. In the past I have taken two grandsons starting back when they were 8-9 years old. One loved it & the other didn't like it at all. Both great kids Just not what one liked. He said his dad makes him come. I told him it won't be that way anymore. Later, Jay"
3197482,forgop,2014-09-23 14:40:00,880,"Haven't done a drive in trip since I was a kid with my parents up in Minnesota. I think half the experience is the flight itself and getting the image above of just how remote you really are from civilization. I'd really prefer to have another parent with another kid or two honestly. Problem is I don't know of anyone interested in doing it. My go-to people are taking trips with spouses or have different vacation plans altogether next year. Just don't want to take them with my cousin and his new wife. There are just too many who don't want to be off the grid a week for such a trip. As of now, it's just me and the girls. They may want the better amenities a drive in offers, but I think a little humbling is needed for them to appreciate the true luxuries they have at home. Nothing wrong with the experience in drinking filtered lake water, an outhouse, and outdoor shower IMO."
3197498,fishforlife,2014-09-23 14:45:00,77,"Took my 28 yr old son and 8 yr old grandson on his first fly in this year to Brace Lake out of Nakina, On. Best time I've ever had in all of my trips north. Grandson was co-pilot, loved it. My son downloaded 25 movies for the 16 hr. drive up and back from Toledo, Oh. Instead of ""are we there yet"" it was "" how many movies Pap"" funny. traveled much better than most adults I know. I had planned on 4 to 5 hrs per day fishing, but it usually ended up being 7 to 8. Make sure to let them pick snacks and drinks the want on the boat. The key is catching fish. Try to plan a shore lunch for them to experience having their catch for dinner. A camera, (disposable) is a good idea for each to capture memories. Let them be involved with the cooking as much as possible. We had campfires 3 or 4 nights with (smores) marshmellows chocolate graham crackers. Make it a little competitive with contests for 1st fish - biggest fish - most fish with small prizes. I let him drive the boat at low speed for a while but be careful. We played cards and a board game in the evenings too. My grandson ended up catching the biggest Pike 40"" and the biggest walleye 24"" I'll never forget him saying OMG Pap it's a monster. At the end of the week, he said he wants to come back next year, so I know he liked it. I won't lie and say it was easy, but you'll never regret the memories made. good luck with your trip and enjoy.Rob"
3197874,NY Walleye,2014-09-23 18:13:00,78,"The last two years I took a fly in trip with my 8yr old son, father and nephew to Lac Hebert in Quebec. Three generations of fishing partners was an awesome experience. The first year he had a great time and loved camp life. This Is a remote lake with no power, just propane lights, fridge, hot water. Spent 5 days fishing 6 to 7 hours a day and caught hundreds of walleye. Trip this year was just as good. Spent 7 days and fished 8 to10 hours a day. Again,this is a trophy lake and caught hundreds of walleye. Need to honest brought an iPad on trip one and an iPod on trip two in case of heavy wind or bad weather. There is solar power to fish house only, and brought a small invertor that clipped on the batteries to charge iPad ect. Brought a satellite phone, must have being that remote in case of emergeny. 8 year old, 19 year old and dad that's 67 need a security blanket. Brought books, movie on iPod, cameras, video camera and recorded a lot of memories on the trip. Son has been asking to go back for three years straight. I asked him if he wanted Disney or Lac Hebert and he picked Lac Hebert. He is hooked for life, and so am I. My father is not getting younger and need to make as many memories as possible. Loved every minute of both trips and so did everyone else."

Very organized, very safe, and very good fishing. For rainy day activities - a couple good books and teach them to play hearts."

3189865,adempsey,2014-09-19 22:50:00,963,"Definitely take them shopping. Let them pick their own lures to fish with. Maybe tie up some harnesses with them.Give them cameras and maybe some binoculars. Others things to use while they're in the boat. Ten minutes at that age is like 10 hours for us.Explore a bit. Get out on some islands maybe. Pick blueberries or something.Teach them how to drive the boat.Definitely have a contest for smallest fish, biggest fish, most fish...whatever."
3189889,Kenny_Ross,2014-09-19 23:31:00,103,"Nows the time to do this....reason why we are looking for waterfront in NW Ont. Im with Frank (Breezy) on this one, leave the laptop at home! For rain days and evenings (when not swimming or burning marshmallows) we bring a deck of cards and some dice for Yahtzee. We also have a cloth checker board. All of these are light and easy to hide in a bag!Kenny"
3190073,pjshorthorn,2014-09-20 06:10:00,5654,"I have to agree that off the grid is only really accomplished by letting go of all those fancy devices we have come too used to in our daily lives. When I took my son for the first time at 10, he was allowed to have his Gameboy along for the drive up to camp. The rule was that when we arrived, away it went and couldn't be used until we left camp. He did wonderfully just being a boy and doing something else that he thought was fun. I let him take the lead each day on when and how long to fish, what to do if he didn't want to fish, etc. Most of the time not fishing, we explored camp, took boat rides to explore new places. He learned how to run a boat at a slow speed, puttered around a campfire, etc. I think allowing the kids to be somewhat in charge of their trip is really important for them to truly enjoy the experience. Us big boys and girls are there to fish and relax as well, but that is secondary IMHO compared to setting an enjoyable experience for the kids. I was fortunate enough to have my son along this year on our trip ( he is now 19) and I can't tell you how great it was to see him enjoy it as much as he did. We just went with the flow and took what the trip offered with no real plan for each and every day. I hadn't relaxed like that in years. I was able to meet my son for dinner the other evening on campus at his university and all we did was talk about the trip and where we would want to go next year.......priceless. This will be one of the best trips of your life regardless of what you bring along for entertainment. Take the time to make the kids a BIG part of planning and doing what they want while in camp and they will be hooked for life. Thanks for helping add a couple more future ""fishing fanatics"" to the world. We need many more. Best of luck with the girls!!! PjShorthorn"

3192561,SinOrSwim,2014-09-21 08:44:00,1528,"I took my 9 year old on his first trip this year. We took his DS and an ipad. the DS never came out of the bag even in the car and he used the ipad for a couple hours on they way up and back and probably less than 30 min total while we were there. He had a blast.That said, I will still take the electronics with just in case. I use my phone and surface tablet while I'm up there. I posted pics to facebook from teh lodge (granted, can't do that on a fly in) and my wife and other 2 boys were able to see the pictures as the trip went along. Personal choice obviously. But, if we had rain or something and there wasn't much to do I would hate for him to dislike the trip because of something small like that. To each their own."
3194786,MikeinMN,2014-09-22 09:26:00,190,"I use slip bobbers for walleyes in Canada, and if your girls are used to bobber fishing for bass and bluegills this would be easy and familiar for them. I definitely agree with teaching them to run the boat and getting them out on shore to do some exploring. Make sure to attach the kill switch lanyard and use the tilt setting on the motor when they are driving the boat. Northern lights have been hit and miss for me too, I've seen them on much less than 50% of my trips and maybe less than 25%. With a clear night sky you will be able to see a few satellites 100% of the nights, and we always like to look for them. Learn a few constellations to share with them. The big dipper is always easy to find and points to Polaris; the 3 stars in Orion's belt are pretty easy too. I like the board or card games idea to replace iPads, but every parent handles this differently. Their best memories will probably not be fishing related, but they will have great memories of the trip."
3194890,SinOrSwim,2014-09-22 09:48:00,1528,There are apps for your smartphone you can point at the sky and it will tell you what satellites etc you are looking at.
3195130,MikeinMN,2014-09-22 11:57:00,190,"There are some really interesting apps for that kind of thing. One of the guys we went with this year had one that would tell when the space station was overhead, we saw it once. He also had one that would identify the origin and destination of planes overhead. I just didn't know if these apps required cell service. We did have service this year, but on a fly in they may not."
3196170,forgop,2014-09-22 20:02:00,880,"The fly-in cabin I was at in August had a satellite for internet service and you could actually get a signal about 100 yards or so from the cabin. We're not going to the same cabin this year though unless I manage to pick up a couple more people. I used to have the satellite app on my iPhone but haven't had it on my Note 3. I reckon the thing to do would be to look at that stuff in advance and ""plan"" on day/time/direction of where we would be able to see that stuff. I'm all for taking the screens away for a week, but just don't want to have them be bored if we're stuck in the cabin for lengthy periods of time due to rain. I've fished after tripping in the water and being soaked when it's 55 degrees/raining and in the mid 30's while it's pouring down rain, but sure won't subject them to anything like that because even for me, it was pretty miserable, let alone what it'd be for them."
3196490,MrSimon,2014-09-23 06:34:00,922,"For a kid's first trip to Canada, I would suggest a drive-to lodge over a fly-in. I think it's great for a kid to experience the the camp atmosphere ... listening to lies in the cleaning hut .... playing horseshoes with the guys from Michigan .... renting the camp ATVs for an afternoon .... buying an ice cream cone in the camp store etc etc etc. This is just my opinion, but I think a fly-in is too risky for a first time trip. There are too many things that could go wrong that might sour the kid's on Canada forever. I also highly recommend taking along one or two of your kids' friends."
3189737,forgop,2014-09-19 21:39:00,880,"Just 300 days before I leave with my 2 daughters, who will be 12 and 10 at the time. My girls and I have fished in the back pond for largemouth bass and bluegill, so certainly never for a week straight on a boat. Figured now would be a great time for them to get a full week of dad so to speak and just experience the fly-in wilderness. I'm thinking we'll alternate between trolling and jigging just to provide some variation. I'm also suspecting we won't be in the boat as much as I have on the guy trips, so I'm thinking a laptop for movies in the cabin on occasion. (I'm already counting on not roughing it during any rain unless the absolutely want to be out).Just curious what other suggestions you might suggest for making this as ""successful"" of a trip as possible for kids who currently have no comprehension of what it's like to be off the grid for a week."
3189745,BreezyPoint,2014-09-19 21:46:00,1581,"If you bring the lap top, you will not be giving them a true off the grid experience. Instead, why don't you spend some time exploring the lakes and creeks looking for wildlife. Show them the stars and northern lights at night. Go swimming in the lake. Teach them to drive the boat. You want to get them excited about what's there so they'll want to return for that. At their age, it would be good for them to get totally off the grid. If they don't do it soon, they will never be able to disconnect.Just my thoughts.Frank"
3189753,mrwalleye5,2014-09-19 21:47:00,1922,"I envy you. Would have loved to take my kids at that age. My suggestion would be Aiken's Lake Lodge. Pricey, but first class. I have been there a lot ( 7 times ) through work. Pit and Julie's kids are a bit younger than yours ( managers that live there during the season)."
3189761,forgop,2014-09-19 21:52:00,880,"Good points. I was only thinking about the laptop to watch movies in the event we were rained in and there's only so much you can do for entertainment if you're stuck in the cabin and it's pouring down rain. I can expect my cousin to endure pouring down rain, but won't subject my girls to that. Would really like the northern lights experience, but have yet to see it in my prior trips."
3189769,forgop,2014-09-19 21:54:00,880,"I already am reserved through Parks to go to Abbey, so I'm all set. Thanks for the suggestion though."
3189777,BreezyPoint,2014-09-19 21:55:00,1581,"You need to find a place where the cabins face north. I have seen northern lights in every month of summer up there, but the later you go, the better. If you have a south facing location, you probably won't see the lights.Frank"
3189785,forgop,2014-09-19 21:57:00,880,I've been out on the water and still not witnessed anything. The extent of what I've seen are plain old stars and the rare airplane overhead.
3189801,BreezyPoint,2014-09-19 22:03:00,1581,Well I hope your kids get to see them. A truly remarkable sight. I see them most commonly between 10pm and midnight after the passage of a cold front with a new moon (the cold front gives really clear air). One of the places I stay has north facing cabins and we can just look out the window and see them. The kids will like the Milky Way as well.Frank
3189817,forgop,2014-09-19 22:13:00,880,"In my 3 trips, my cabins will have faced west, east, and east once again next year. I just looked up the moon calendar and it'll be a new moon the day after we leave."
3189833,BreezyPoint,2014-09-19 22:17:00,1581,If your cabin faces east you may still have a good chance. A really good display of the lights can cover quite a bit of sky stretching from east to west. Good luck.Frank
