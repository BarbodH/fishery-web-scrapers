559140,Guest,2006-07-07 22:17:00,0,"Thanks for the web site. I was told at one time that you could only bring so many gallons (litres) of gas into Ontario in your boat and vehicle... is that true? If so, how many gallons are we allowed to bring in? Ever been checked?"
559143,Jesse-WI,2006-07-07 23:50:00,534,The law is written generically and allows for a reasonable amount. i.e. all tanks filled including aux tanks if you choose to bring them.
559150,grt1,2006-07-08 12:14:00,259,"the price in Red Lake yesterday was $1.259 a litre or $5.67 an imperial (canadian) gallon(4.5 litres x $1.259). this works out to be $5.01 a US gallon (3.98litres x $1.259). I filled my truck and a Jerry can, the cost $138.00. ouch!!!!"
559157,Sutsgold,2006-07-08 14:42:00,219,As of yesterday the best price in international falls was 3.08 Paid a 1.19 liter in sioux. Best prices were the safeway in dryden. If you have a dominicks or safeway card you can get anywhere from 3 to 7 cents off per liter. Enjoy your trip.
