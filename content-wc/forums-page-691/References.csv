We've been up north many times but always at the same place and we've been toying with the idea of trying someplace new. The Provinces of Quebec or Ontario are acceptable. As far as travel distance, approx. 400 from Buffalo or 250 miles from the Thousand Islands Bridge would be about right, give or take 50 miles. We are looking for a secluded camp that is not too accessible, fly-ins would be considered. We target walleye and pike. We prefer housekeeping plan packages. I will thank you all in advance for any suggestions, websites or contacts."

You can try the Haliburton area, there's some seclusion, but offers less fish than destinations further north. You'll be flooded with people and cottages in the Kawarthas or in the Muskokas. I would suggest lengthening your travel distance if want better fishing and especially more seclusion. NWO Fishing Bum"
