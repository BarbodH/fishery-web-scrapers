559208,Guest,2006-07-10 12:30:00,0,Are there any motels in Sioux Loookout that a father/son group could stay for a night? If so what are the names and how much roughly per night? Also is there a good bait shop in Sioux Lookout that a person can purchase leeches and crawlers from?

It ran us about $100/ night but we had 5 guys per room. As for bait there is a place called Ojibway Outfitters where we buy minnows etc. before we go out to our lodge. Regards, ch47"
