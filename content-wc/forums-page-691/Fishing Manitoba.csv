559095,Hammer_74,2006-07-05 21:25:00,18,I was wondering if any Manitobans would like to direct me to some Walleye infested fishing holes? I just moved to Winnipeg 6 months ago and was thinking on hauling my boat here from Ontario. I also would like to know a good place to buy maps. Thank you

Great carp fishing to be had also. Manitoba is full of lakes to fish head north also to get into some great action. Head to Lockport for the Catfishing right now if your into that.

559239,Hammer_74,2006-07-10 19:47:00,18,"Thank you all for your help, that will give me a good start. I come from Dryden Ontario rivereye. I frequently fished the Wabigoon chain lakes(Dinorwic, Rock, Wabigoon), Minnitaki Lake, and Lac Seul(Williams Bay and Sioux Lookout area). I am a mainly a walleye hunter and have not fished a great deal for other species. Thank you for the other links, I will be sure to check them out. If any one else has any suggestions please feel free to reply. Thank you all."
