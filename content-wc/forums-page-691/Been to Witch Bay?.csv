559176,Guest,2006-07-09 13:32:00,0,Anyone been to witch bay camp on LOTW this year? The usual question: How's fishing? We did well last years with jigs and spinners both for walleye. We had five muskie follows. Around July 15th last year. Icedog

Walleyes were HOT- lots of fish shallow and even more on the mid lake humps. Average size was better then last year. LOTS of 20-21 inch fish and the largest we caught was 24"". I estimate we caught an average of 65-70 walleyes a day. Pike- Was a little slow, but to be honest we didnt really even try to catch them. Our biggest was a 29"". Muskies- Lots of follows and 1 nice 42"" fish boated. Good Luck!"
