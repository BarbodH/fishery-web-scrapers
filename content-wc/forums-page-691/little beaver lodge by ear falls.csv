He does have a plane if you want to experience a 1 day fly out. I'm a local guy that brought up 12 Americans to the lodge 2 years ago. I met them at LBL to go fishing. The owner, who I know, was very cheesed at me that I brought my own bait with me. (He felt I should've bought the minnows from him.) I'm thinking I just brought 12 guests to your camp for a week and you're concerned about my 2 dozen minnows that I bought in town............give me a break. I'm trying to convince those guys to go to Evergreen, but they re-booked again this year and caught alot of fish in the narrows, near Lunker Point, and around Goose Island. Once again, it is a clean camp, good cabins, a sometimes grumpy owner.....you'll like it there. It's good!"

Doug Gawley runs a nice camp there, you will not be dissapointed in the pick you made. The cabns are top notch there AC and great sleeping acommidations. You dont have to bring a sleeping bag or even a bath towel!! It is all there for you. Great fishing to be had right in the area."
559139,Guest,2006-07-07 21:03:00,0,sounds like I made the right choice. did you say the cabins have air conditioning.how far do you think a guy will have to run from camp to get on the fish? any musky around there?
559147,Guest,2006-07-08 09:55:00,0,Doug is great. have been flying out with him for over 7 years. He tells me where he is taking me and I go!!! Never has done me wrong--ever. His 1 day fly out lakes are incredible--do it if you have the money--you will not be dissapointed. you will get to the point of where you are sick of catching walleye. can not even drink beer you catch so many--have to put the pole down to drink your beer. DO it.
