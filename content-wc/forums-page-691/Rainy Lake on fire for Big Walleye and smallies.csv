Trying to guide on the lake is fun but very hard to catch lunchers. Numbers are down but man are the big ones are sure biting, in one typical day we average about 20-25 fish but they all number in the 25 inch to 30 inches. Best lure for us is Lindy Rigs and crawlers. Big fish are in the 27ft-32ft I found. But someone told me they are catching luncher fish on the shallower reefs and humps."
