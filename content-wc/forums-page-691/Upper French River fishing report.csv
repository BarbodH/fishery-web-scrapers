559010,Guest,2006-07-02 12:24:00,0,"Just got back from Casa Blanca Lodge fishing with my 2 brothers and a father/son combo. We fish primarily smallmouth, but did catch a some evening walleye in Sand Bay and the Flats. The water temp was 70-71 degrees F. Most of the large smallmouth came from the Sandy Island area. I caught a Canadian personal best of 20.5 inches, and also a 19 incher, two or three 18 inchers, along with several 16-17 inchers, and of course alot of smaller males. My oldest brother caught a personal best of 19 inch smallmouth, and the other brother caught a 19.5 incher, along with a 19, 2 or 3 18+ inchers etc. The larger smallmouth were related to cover in shallow water on sand beaches mainly, though we caught several large smallmouth in Wigwam bay (75 degrees F), which I could hardly believe. Casa Blanca was a good lodge, and we will go back there most likely on the next Upper French trip. Usually fish Birch Island Resort at Minaki. Don"
559011,rockpt,2006-07-02 12:46:00,589,Good report. I used to go to Tall Pines Camp on Sandy Island back in the 80s and 90s. You guys did some traveling if you were fishing in Wigwam Bay.
559100,Guest,2006-07-06 09:56:00,0,I'm leaving for Sandy Haven on Sandy Island next week. It is nice to see a recent report. What was working for the bass as far as lures? Dave
559141,Guest,2006-07-07 22:44:00,0,"Dave, 3 and 1/2 inch Bass Pro tender tubes in white, TN shad, green, or puke, fished on floating docks on the sand, on Sandy Island. Also good action in Chaudiere rapids after a hike. We caught some also at Wigwam Bay mouth, chunk rock points, and one fellow in camp did OK in Marsh Bay. I believe the owner, or some fellow sitting on the porch mouthed off to us when we fished the docks at your lodge, if that is the one near the west end of the island. Of course he does not own the water, but we prefer no confrontations, so we left, and were not rude to him. Good Luck, Don PS: My oldest brother caught the biggest smallmouth of his life, 19 inches, on a jig spinner #6, with 1/16 ounce white painted jighead (Cabela's) with 2 inch walleye power grub."

559145,Slimeball,2006-07-08 06:49:00,56,"Don, The Lodge on the West end of Sandy is Tall Pines Camp. I would have told him to ""Stick It"". You on the other hand did the right thing. Jason"
559153,rockpt,2006-07-08 12:35:00,589,"The guy who now owns Tall Pines has a real attitude problem, has run off customers and made some enemies up there. It's a shame because it's a decent camp and the guy who owned it from the 70s to the 90s was a class act."
559154,Guest,2006-07-08 13:02:00,0,"The family that used to own Tall Pines is from the same town I am from here in Ohio. As for the people who own it now, I don't know them at all. Sandy Haven is always super. We've been going there for about seven years and have never had a bad time. Clean cottages with hot & cold running water and 24-hr electricity and the people who run it are always very friendly. I mostly walleye and muskie fish there but like to chase the smallies at least once for a change of pace. Thanks for the info, Don. Dave"
