559181,lazyk,2006-07-09 19:07:00,26,My fishing partners tell me that `bloodsuckers` and leeches are different and that `bloodsuckers` are not very good for bait. These are what I take to be the mottled brown leeches that I occasionally see swimming near the surface. Leeches that they refer to are black colored and smaller. Is there really a difference in fish catching ability and why would that be? It is my understanding that all leeches are `bloodsuckers` and there are different species. Anyone want to take a crack at this one? LazyK
559183,Guest,2006-07-09 19:33:00,0,"Are there two types of leeches? Yes Are they black and brown? Yes Are the black ones usually used for bait? Yes Are the black ones easier to trap? Yes Have I caught fish with brown leeches? Yes Have I done a fair test with both black and brown simultaneously over a lengthy period with aggressive fish to determine if indeed the black are better? No Does it seem like the black work better from my experience? Yes, particularly for walleye. If given the option walleye fishing, would I prefer leeches over minnows or crawlers? No, definately not. Is there a situation where I would use leeches? Yes, if I was out for several days fishing and camping in very hot weather, without cool water and aeration for minnows or cool air storage for crawlers. In terms of options for live bait, leeches are incredibly resilient, but they simply don't catch as many walleye as minnows or to a lesser extent crawlers, at least in Northern Ontario.

Leeches I believe have a suction on one end. The large brown/black leeches you see swimming along shore in NWO are referred to as horse leeches. I beleive, and while they are better than nothing, they are poor bait. I think there are many species of leeches, some are regional as well. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
