I heard that it was pretty rundown but new owners took over about 2-3 years ago and I am wondering if it is now habitable. Additionally, of course, how was the fishing the second week of June and was it close to the camp or a long ride away?? Any info would be greatly appreciated!!"

That one was so-so. fairly nice on the inside but it was run down on the outside. No dock to speak of we beached our boats out front which did work ok. The cabin is 6 miles from there base camp. NO electricity other than from a Honda generator which ran fine, this also ran a small freezer. There was no oven just a 4 burner cook top which again worked OK. Shower was inside and was hot. We caught I think 7 mice inside. I no we did not get them all as they grazed on our sunflower seeds the night before we left. All said and done I think we will be staying there again next year. If you do not need the Holiday Inn atmosphere this works. Almost forgot the OutHouse was pretty smelly ( no pun intended). But functional. Holler if you need anything else. Terry"

559131,Guest,2006-07-07 10:48:00,0,"We stayed at Northumbrian a couple years ago(3 I think) and it was a dump. The new owners had taken over and I wasnt impressed. The bed sheets werent changed, the floor wasnt swept, and numerous other things. Oh, and they overcharged us and wouldnt pay up for almost a year. Just wasnt impressed with anything about the place. We now stay at Winoga Lodge on Abrams and they are great, everything is clean and the owners are very nice. We just got back two days ago and the fishing was alright, not as good as years past, but still good luck. Did most of our fishing on reefs in minnataki. I am also from Iowa, I live in Cedar Falls."

559134,IaDave,2006-07-07 13:58:00,476,I agree with you on Winoga Lodge. Haved stayed there 4 times but not in the last 2 years. Hope to get back maybe this fall. Always stayed in the spring(late May) or the fall(mid- Sept). In the spring you can catch tons of walleye at the mouth of the Marchington River which is a very short ride from the island. The owner is a great guy who will do anything to make sure you catch fish. I was born and raised in Cedar Falls but now live in Cedar Rapids.
559138,Guest,2006-07-07 19:42:00,0,We never went into any cabins. just the office. Fishing in the chutes in the 25 to 50' of water was good. Crawlers and spinners for us crawlers and jigs worked for some of the guys as well. great weather. I am from the Waterloo/Cedar Falls area. Terry
