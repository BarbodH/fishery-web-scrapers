559263,Guest,2006-07-11 12:50:00,0,"I went to ""Advanced Search Form"". In ""keyword(s)"" I put ""minor"". In ""Search Forum"" I picked ""Canada-Public"". Down a ways is a thread entitled ""Border Crossing"" dated Aug 08, 2005, with 8 replies. One of those has the form I remember seeing last year. Hope this helps."
559265,Guest,2006-07-11 14:16:00,0,"I made up such a form and posted in the past, sorry I cann't remember when or under what topic. It would have been posted under Gary_IA or Gary from Iowa or Gary_IA unlogged. I'l summarize what I can recall: Written notarized letter from both parents or guardians. Include authorization to seek emergency medical care for child. Include address of parents or each parent if different. Include home phone and work phone and cell phone number of parents. Authorize permission to travel to and from Canada for the period of and where the destination is in Canada. Child should have raised seal birth certificate and photo id (schools often have this) In Iowa you can get one from Department of Transportation but a lot of red tape. Do a google search on Ontario on consent for minors to travel. I believe, but do not guarantee this, in lieu of birth certificate, a letter from the family lawyer or Doctor stating that child is the son or daughter of named parents, that the doctor or lawyer has personal knowledge, etc., etc., helps to establish who the child belongs to. Birth certificate or passport is better. Passport is best because it has photo id. A hypothetical letter might read.
