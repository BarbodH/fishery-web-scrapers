558521,Guest,2006-06-17 00:47:00,0,"i was up at gary and pat's evergreen last september, had a native guide for about $125, he took us on an hour boat ride, i used my gps to track it, went back 2 more times during the week and caught tons of fish without seeing another person and missed all the rocks, if we seen a rock stickin out of the water, we fished all around it and caught fish, i love that lake."
559169,Noel,2006-07-09 10:47:00,115,"Steve, We will be arriving in the late Friday afternoon at Onaway. Once we unpack we would like to go out for a few hours that evening. Since I have never been in the area can you suggest of few spots to try that are close to camp. I dont want to go too far since it is evening, I dont know the area, and dont want to get lost the first night. The next day the guide will take us out. thanks Noel"
558389,Guest,2006-06-13 07:53:00,0,"Our group will be at Onaway from the June 23 to June 30. Blair has a couple of real good guides that will show you some of the more productive spots. They have never had a problem with marking them with a GPS. If you are there the same time we are I will give you a couple of more spots we have fished the last 7 years. We like to find the out of the way spots that we can have to ourselves rather than ""banging the sand banks"" with everybody else. If the weather cooperates we will go and explore new water at least 2-3 times during the week, and find that new ""honey hole"". That is the real beauty of LS, there is a new best spot every year. If you are there the same time, we are in cabin 3 right across from the boat house and dock, stop in and have a brew or 2. Steve"
558392,Noel,2006-06-13 09:13:00,115,"Steve, thanks for the advice. We wont be there till mid-July. I am thinking about cancelling the guide, saving the $150 and just having Blair mark a few spots on the map for me to go try. Or maybe I can do a search here on Walleye Central and find some advice on spots to try in mid-July. I am Fort Atkinson, Wi. Good Luck next week. Noel"
558394,Guest,2006-06-13 10:11:00,0,"We have been fishing out of Onaway for many years and usually go in August and sometimes back in September. Blair know the lake very well and sells a good map. He will go over it with you an mark hazards. I can also suggest some places to start looking, but you will see good spots from the map also. The lake has more structure than any other lake I have ever fished. If you stay to the trails Blair marks on your map you will have little trouble. If you deviate from that, just go slow and be careful. Once you make a good run, save on you plotter and your good to go. That time of year some popular areas are McKenzie bay, the area around the Honey moon Islands, Manitoba Point, Windigo point and don't forget South bay. There are a number of spots in South Bay, I'll let you figure them out. When you leave the run from the Honey Moons to Poplar narrows to go to South bay, be careful. Blair can help you with this. There is an area in there that is tricky, but once you go through slowly and see what is there, it will be no big deal from that point on. If you are not opposed to making a run and want a change of pace, try Broad and Sunlight lakes. It's kind of a neat area and you probably won't have much company in there that time of year. I'm sure you guys will do OK without a guide. Your staying at a wonderful camp and Blair is very helpful. Good luck,"
558409,Guest,2006-06-13 14:14:00,0,Steve from Madison Our group will be at Onaway Lodge at the exact same time. I am looking forward to the trip and hoping for good stable weather. If it is ok maybe I will swing over with a couple beers. It is always interesting to hear how other groups are doing. North Bound
558410,michigan eyes,2006-06-13 14:55:00,7,"Noel, I guess I must have thought you were going in the next week or 2 thats why I harped on the report a bit......Oh well! so to answer your question as for a guide or not, If you have a GPS to nav. the tricky spots/passageways etc. then I wouldn't bother for the navigational purposes. The best way to go it seems to me & A lot of people is to follow some other group of boats the 1st day or so to find access paths/routs etc. then mark them on the gps. for later in the week. A guide will put you oon the bite automatically from the 1st day or so & that would be well worth it when trying new waters. The water temp varied from 64-68 up in McKenzie Bay last week but the fish were still shallow. However you go, you will be pleased with the areas in the NW sect. of LS im sure. Good Luck ME"
558411,Guest,2006-06-13 15:14:00,0,"Northbound..Our group is really looking forward to this year, 5 regulars and a newbie. Our group has been staying at Onaway for the last 6 years and love it. Blair and Kathy are the best and so is the equipment. We also do not mind sharing our spots with people, just not at the same time. I really like South Inlet, Ghost Narrows, Stoney Point, and the islands up in MacKenzie. We don't work the sand bank much, way to much traffic. Like I said earlier, we like to venture out and explore new water, this year we may go Sawmill and work our way back, wind will tell us what to do. Noel....It happens that my cousin will be in the Big cabin at about the same time as you are there. If this is your first time, hire the guide anyway, Money well spent. Then explore the rest of the week. Once you get a feel of where, what, and how it makes everything so much easier. Plus if you can get Percy or Blair to take you out, the shore lunch alone is worth the price of admission, not only in what you eat, but where you eat it."

558452,NateW,2006-06-14 12:39:00,96,"I'll be at Onaway in mid-July as well. If this is your first trip to the camp you'll love it. This is our 5th trip to LS and we've never had a guide.Like was posted above, part of our enjoyment is finding the fish on our own. Get a good map--not one of the cheap black & white ones they sell to the lodges, but the good ""Explorer Series"" color maps they sell at the bait shop in Ear Falls. Take it to Blair and he'll mark out all the hazards and some good fishing places for you to start with. I am sure you can catch more fish with a guide but is it enough to justify $150/day more? I don't know. We've never had a guide and we have always had a great time. To me, good times aren't always measured by the number of fish in the boat. I'd rather apply that $150 to beer. But everyone is different- know I am! Good luck. We'll be there July 14 - 21."
558471,Guest,2006-06-15 09:31:00,0,Blair has the same maps as 4 seasons has. The are color and have good detail in most areas. Have Blair go over the main routes with you though. There are still some things not shown on any map. Lac Seul is know for rocks just popping up. Once Blair shows you the main routes you won't have any problems.
558487,Guest,2006-06-15 15:32:00,0,Try fishing Broad lake and Sunlight or Manitoba point in the main body. Used to catch alot of walleye around a rockpile in the middle of Broad and at the river channel coming into the lake. Good luck
558316,Noel,2006-06-12 08:09:00,115,"Guys, I am coming to Lac Suel for the first time after 12 years of fishing the Minaki area. We are staying at Onaway Lodge. I have scheduled a guide to take us out the first day. My thoughts were that being the first time on Lac Suel I could get some spots marked on the GPS for the rest of the week, and get some advice on where the rocks are so that I wont rip the lower unit out. I dont need any help with HOW to fish walleyes. But I am having some 2nd thougths about the cost of a guide. Could I find some decent fishing spots on my own and save the cost of the guide? Will the camp mark some spots on my map to try and give me some advice about the rocks? For those of you that have fished out on Onaway what is your advice? thanks. Noel"

558317,wooglin,2006-06-12 08:25:00,371,"My group never hired a guide, I think because we liked the 'chase' of getting on the fish ourselves. It's a sense of accomplishment I guess. We enjoy wandering around camp, making friends, talking spots, bait and patterns with the other groups in camp. As for finding hidden rocks and potential hazards, I'd just get a good map of the area you are in - much cheaper than a guide - guides are for finding fish, not rocks! :) PS, from what I've heard/read, guides aren't too keen on allowing you to GPS spots when out with them."

558341,wooglin,2006-06-12 10:14:00,371,"No suggestions from me on that part of the lake, but I'd guess someone on this board will. My guess is that any gas station or even the resorts in that area, would have maps for sale though! Best of luck!"
558351,michigan eyes,2006-06-12 12:15:00,7,"Just got back sat. from week up in NW. sec. Lac Seul and the bite was awesome until a double cold front came last thurs. We outposted up in McKenzie Bay and didn't need to do an long hauls but the guys were doing well all over it seemed. We had a hard time keeping 40 doz. Minnows alive for more than a day or 2 but they worked good dead-frozen & leeches & crawlers worked well also. Water was down 2 feet or so from last year & Warmer than usual temp. but we still never fished deeper than 8 ft. Good maps are available at the 4 Seasons Sport Shop in Ear Falls, about 20 min drive north from Onaway. Between me & my cousin we caught anywheres from 25-100+ fish per outing (we went morn & eve. every day except first & last day there). The bite got a little tough when the temps went from high around 90's down to 50 degrees in less than 2 days. I think I landed 17 northerns for the week (all while jiggin for eye's) mostly all in the SLOT size...27-34 in. Some days the fish were almost all in the slot & others they were rather smaller eyes with a few fish being 25-27 inches. Hope this helps. GOOD LUCK! ME"
558357,Guest,2006-06-12 15:17:00,0,"I am glad to hear that you had a good fishing trip. If you don't mind me asking, do you know what the water temperature was in McKinsey Bay?"
558358,Guest,2006-06-12 15:40:00,0,"Michigan, nice long report however you failed to give your opinion on my original question. Guide or no guide for a newcomer to Onaway Lodge in mid July?? Thanks"
558385,Guest,2006-06-13 06:48:00,0,"Most camp owners will mark a depth map for you. It is always a good idea to get a guide on a new lake. Peace of mind, and generally lots of knowledge of the area, fishing tactics, depth to fish, etc. I'm not sure the price of guides at onaway but expect to pay around , $150 for the day. (well worth it) I would call your host Blair and Kathy discuss your concerns and I'm sure you'll be back to the Lacseul. Enjoy, Pat"
