559069,Moondog,2006-07-04 13:44:00,362,Has the fishing improved on Gullrock? We were there 10 days ago and it was a tuff bite.......nothing big and not much eating. I understand that ice out was early and really screwed things up.

559078,Guest,2006-07-04 23:07:00,0,Was it the mayflys? I know some guys that hammered the fish in early June.
559083,Moondog,2006-07-05 10:41:00,362,I don't think so altho the last few days (we left June 22)the mayflies were in flotillas on top of the water. We got there June 3rd and it was already turning off. Really slow all but a few days.
559195,sifty,2006-07-10 09:18:00,46,Just got back from Gull rock. Fishing was slow and not much for size. Talked to a couple people that have been up there for the last month and they said this year has been the worst in the last 7 years. Our biggest walleye was 22 inches and we only caught 4 fish bigger than slot size. Most were 12-14 inches. Talked to everybody in camp and they were experiancing the same thing.
