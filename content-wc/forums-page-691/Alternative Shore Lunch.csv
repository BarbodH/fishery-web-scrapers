559148,wiggle,2006-07-08 11:19:00,400,"How about boiled fish. Walleyes would work, but northern pike meat stays together much better, and tastes just as good, if not better. Just fillet out the meat and drop it into boiling water for a few minutes. Melt some butter and your ready to go. Easy, quick, and cleaner.( if you can get by the slime and stink of the pike) Brad"
559174,Guest,2006-07-09 12:58:00,0,"Last couple of years we took barbequed pork sandwiches just heat the meat and serve with buns pickles and chips, very easy. Also pre-cooked brats just brown them over open fire and eat. We try to keep it easy, we eat shore lunch everyday as we are far from camp (40min )Fish is eaten about every other day for lunch, and 3 main meals at camp. At camp we have a gas grill and put the fillets in foil with onion green pepper and lemon then at the end add salsa,add salt & pepper to taste, it is really good-(only in Canada) everything tastes good."

559012,Newby,2006-07-02 16:50:00,148,"Our group just returned from a week in Canada. This year we decided to eat fresh walleye for shore lunch every day, but by the end of the week we were starting to get a little bit sick of all the fried fish. Normally we have one or two days that everyone makes cold cut sandwiches but we wondered what everyone else did. Do you have alternative recipes for walleye, or do you pack optional lunches. Surely the great community of Walleye Central will be able to help us out with our shore lunch dilemma. P.S. I scanned archives but could not find the any previous threads on this subject. I thought it had come up before, not too long ago."
559014,phishfearme,2006-07-02 19:17:00,1242,"newb - years ago we used to do the shore lunch major production but now we consider it a waste of prime time. lunch for us is simply something out of a can (shrimp, crab, clams, beef, smoked oysters, chicken/ham spread, etc.) with ritz crackers. simple, quick and good. we do however make a bit of a production for our dinners and then it's out to chase eyes til dark. to each his own. - phish"
559021,Skyraptor,2006-07-02 22:01:00,291,How can anyone get tired of eating fish for shore lunch. For us it is a rite that we always look forward to and do each day. That is part of going to Canada and the tradition of fishing. Part of going to Canada is the fishing but the other part is making sure my kids and their kids enjoy a shore lunch the way I enjoyed it as a kid. To eat out of a can is just not part of our tradition.
559022,BOBBYB,2006-07-02 23:09:00,44,We ate fish everyday for shore lunch and it was super. When you can only bring back 4 you tend to enjoy the shore lunch more. We also had a jar of tartar and cocktail sauce and boiled some walleyes and then cooled and ate like shrimp cocktail. excellent.
559023,Guest,2006-07-03 00:54:00,0,"Most days we have a very large lunch back at camp, it gives everyone a chance take a swim or nap before going back out for the evening. These lunches consist of everything and when we get back at dark from the evening fish it's brats and hamburger over the grill with a bit of walleye in tinfoil with veggies butter and seasoning. The few days we spend the entire time away from camp we will supplement the walleye/veggie/butter in tinfoil with homemade chili or soup. These lunches are on shore and easy to do as all you need is a fire."
559024,phishfearme,2006-07-03 07:08:00,1242,you can do exactly what you're talking about at dinner and not have to spend hours out on the lake. i assume you were never fishing when there was an open fire restriction - seems to me that's all we see during our trips.
559026,Mr Ranger,2006-07-03 07:54:00,272,"Looks like lots of opinion but not many ideas. First my opinion. You do what works for you and your group, that is why you are there. Here is a pretty simple one we have used for both shore lunch and dinner on the grill. You will need one of the camping screen grilles or flat plate with holes in it. Got mine at Gander and prefer the 3/8"" mesh cooking screen. Spray Pam on grille before cooking. Take your fillets and lightly rub a very little bit of olive oil on each side place on medium hot grill and then sprinkle with seasoning. I prefer to use a home made Italian tasting seasoning. I also like to briskly rub lemon zest on the fillets before placing them on the grill. You could drizzle lemon on as well. This is much easier than frying and I think it is much better. Enjoy"
559057,Guest,2006-07-04 06:02:00,0,"Shore lunch is a great tradition.We take a couple of lp single burner stoves,baked beans,precooked potatoes,asst.lemon pepper,tarter sause, croutons,canned mixed fruit for desert.Whatever. Pick a time during a slow bite. One hour tops and we are fishing again. BON APETITE, BON VOYAGE"
559071,retire55,2006-07-04 14:09:00,1029,"I concur with Mr. Ranger ""You do what works for you and your group"". For our group, we never have lunch. In camp or otherwise. We're on the water at 0530 hrs after toast and coffee. Complete breakfast, which could include walleye, occurs at 1000 hrs. We fish until dinner (which often includes walleye) at 1730 hrs. After dinner, we fish till dark or later. However, here's one alternative for cooking walleye for a shore lunch over an open fire (need a grate). Fold tinfoil (18 in wide X 36 in long) in half to form square (18 X 18) Fold another piece of tinfoil exactly the same size Dice two large sweet onions (e.g. vidalia ) Dice two peppers of your preferred colours Mix the diced onion and pepper together Spread a 5/8 inch layer of onion/pepper mixture on tinfoil Add 4 tablespoons of butter (1 in each quadrant) Place boneless walleye fillets on top of onion/pepper mixture Salt and pepper to taste (can add dill or other seasoning if desired) Pour remaining onion/pepper mixture over fillets Can add 1 can mushroom soup if mushroom gravy desired Cover with second piece of tinfoil Tightly fold all edges of tinfoil at least twice to close Cook at medium to high heat for 20 minutes"
