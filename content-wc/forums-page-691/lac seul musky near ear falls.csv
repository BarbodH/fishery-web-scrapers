559155,Guest,2006-07-08 14:05:00,0,i think the musky are at the other end of the lake. i've never seen any caught up that way. big pike? find a weedbed and have at it. they are everywhere.
559156,Guest,2006-07-08 14:33:00,0,"Exactly. I've never seen or heard of any muskie caught in the Ear Falls section of the lake, not that there couldn't be a couple around, but certainly not worth targeting. The limited muskie in the lake are generally found in the northeast section. But pike . . . everywhere! Deep cabbage weedbeds is you best bet for targeting active pike. The larger the weedbed, and the closer to deeper water the better. NWO Fishing Bum"
