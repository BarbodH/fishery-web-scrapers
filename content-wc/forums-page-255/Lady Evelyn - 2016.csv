They both offer similar fishing packages, but different parts of the lake. Any suggestions for a late July trip? thanks."
4091961,doubleheader,2015-07-31 09:02:00,2652,"I was only there one time but I don't think it will make much difference. Either locale should be fine. The lake isn't that big, but for eastern Ontario the fishing is excellent."
4092321,adempsey,2015-07-31 12:09:00,963,"I've been to both Island 10 and Garden Island Lodge in the summer. We had good fishing around both lodges, but Garden Island is in a better location to access more of the lake. They really aren't THAT far apart and you won't really limit yourself staying at Island 10, it's just that GI is central and, at least for me, closer to really good smallmouth bass and walleye spots.You should check out Red Pine Lodge as well, they just re-opened and might have a better deal for you. I haven't stayed there myself though, but would have no problem doing so. I fished around Red Pine when I stayed at Island 10, but never went fished much of the eastern part of the lake. Although, I am not sure what boats they use as GI and Island10 have some really awesome boats.Island10 used to be a lot cheaper as well ($400 per person less for a similar experience), but I think they have had to raise the rates over the years and are now closer to GI rates. If the price difference isn't a factor, I'd choose GI.The one disadvantage of GI is that it is in the middle of the larger part of the lake, so weather might impact you more than if you were at Island 10. We never had much of a problem though.The one thing I distinctly remember going there my first time is on the way to Garden Island you pass by Island 10. It's a beautiful lodge and the cabins look amazing. I was thinking ""Why am I not staying there!!??!?!"". I had no regrets going to GI at all though and prefer GI over Island10."
4092873,fishron,2015-07-31 17:31:00,317,"My group fished Lady Evelyn three years in a row out of Island Ten so I can't speak to the other lodges. Ken runs a great camp and a ten year old would be awed by the experience. Mealtimes are a great sharing experience and a big part of what the camps have to offer. We had some great days that were accompanied by wind and sometimes rain. I caught some great walleyes that I could document with pictures, mainly trolling hot-n-tots along the shorelines. Any rockpile can produce good smallmouth action. Just as a sidelight, fishing one of the rockpiles not far from the lodge, I had a loon follow my lure in on multiple casts. His spotted body was clearly visible right behind my lure and I ceased fishing the area because the last thing I want on my line is an angry loon. My complaint about Lady Evelyn is the restrictive limit of 17 inches at the top of your possession limit. Tossing back multiple 18 plus walleye that in my opinion would not devastate the fishery was no fun. It wouldn't make much difference for a great experience for your son. Have a great trip."
4093081,alberta bum,2015-07-31 19:35:00,312,"I leave in. 2 weeks to go fish from red Pine for a week.. I can pretty much gaurantee 90% of my fishing will be done around garden island area. Great fishing in that part of the lake,, it can get rough there though.. Island 10 looks really nice when I go flying by. Island 10 and garden island are a lot closer together than you may think,, a run through the narrows and out into the lake.. 3 miles maybe. Anther member from here is there fishing right now,, I'm sure he will comment when he gets home. Get lots of 1/4oz jig heads where ever you go."
4097009,fishincrazy,2015-08-02 21:01:00,1282,I've always gone to GI since our first trip 23 years ago. It is closer to the deeper part of the lake I guess it depends on what your looking for. When do you plan on going? I will be there the last week of August. I can't wait FC
4097473,pawalleye32,2015-08-03 06:50:00,18,Thanks all. Hoping for a late July trip - after baseball season! adempsey - nice website! Looks like we can't go wrong at GI or Island10.
4191113,rsiminski,2015-09-09 13:26:00,53,"I have been to Garden Island the past two years and will be going back for 2016. I cant really coment on Island 10 but as others have said its very similar. I have noticed that it seems like most of Island 10's guest fish Franks Falls and the Gut, you have to drive right past GI to get there. Garden Island has a ton of excellent fishing spots on their end and all of the people in my group for the past two years have landed 28""-30"" walleyes multiple times. The best thing about these spots is that you wont see other lodges fishing that area like you do franks and the gut. Also if you enjoy mixing it up GI will cache a canoe for you above Franks Falls. We fished the river and center falls last year for specs. Its a great change of scenery and center falls is five times the size of Franks. We also went after lakers on Lady Sydney lake one day. Joe and GI runs an awesome camp and you wont be dissapointed. Either way no matter where you pick to go on Lady E. you're going to have a fantastic trip."
