4190089,ziggyzag,2015-09-09 00:02:00,125,Osullivans Rainbow lodge by Nakina is a drive to location with some great walleye and pike fishing and the price is not bad. www.osullivansrainbow.com
4190433,Matt64,2015-09-09 07:41:00,7,Thank you. I had never heard of them. Have you fished there before? Are there many other camps of the lake or is it pretty quiet? Matt
4191553,onetimedave,2015-09-09 16:00:00,502,Just to clear the air. There is only one (1) cabin on Melchett Lake. Melchett #2 as it was known was burned several years ago at the request of the Ministry. This leaves only Melchett #1 operated by AWO. There is a trappers cabin on the outlet of Melchett. This cabin and surroundings in very BAD condition. Does look as it has not been used in years. Have been going to this lake for at least the past 10 years and more likely 15 years. Never been more than 2 commercial cabins on lake during that time. Nearest commercial cabins would be on Kap lake which is connected to Melchett via the Kap river. Now and then you will see someone from Kap Lake but not often
4195465,Matt64,2015-09-11 11:15:00,7,Thanks for the input. We are heading to Goose Bay Camp on Lac Seul.
4198089,fishpoop,2015-09-13 03:53:00,630,"I like to stay at what I call fish camps meaning, small resorts, basic housekeeping cabins, nothing fancy. No 5 Star cuisine and jet ski's for me, thank you. I like places where the attraction is fishing. Andy Myers Lodge on Eagle Lake is a pretty good camp. Muskies, walleyes, trout Red Wing Lodge Sabaskong Bay LoTW is a nice basic family run fish camp. walleye, muskie, smallmouth bass, pike Walsh's Bay Store Camp Oak Island N.W. Angle LoTW is another good fish camp. This is on an island so it's boat in access and also on the Minnesota side of the border so you drive into Canada at Warroad, cross back into Mn. and if you want to fish the Canadian side you have to use the remote border phone to call in. Muskie Bay Resort on Crow/Kakagi Lake Nestor Falls. Deep clear water trout and muskie. some walleye, but you can cross the road and fish Sabaskong Bay or Whitefish Bay of LoTW too. Family run house keeping cabins and motel rooms. I've stayed at all those and had good trips with each of them. No problems with any of places."
4185777,Matt64,2015-09-07 09:11:00,7,"Hello,I have been reading the message boards for some time and have enjoyed it. Today I joined and would like to post my question. I have the opportunity to get back up to Canada fishing this fall. I have taken a few years off because of work and kids. I have fished Lake of the Woods as a kid (70-80s) and Lac Suel (90s-2011). Now I have to choose someplace to go last minute.I am looking at Crawford Camps on LOTW and Goose Bay Camp on Lac Suel. I am also open to trying a smaller less crowded lake. I like catching fish but I also like pursuit of finding them and the adventure. Peaceful time on the lake with a friend is relaxing.Any ideas or comments would be appreciated.Thank You"

4185993,BornToFish,2015-09-07 11:05:00,1224,"There are lots of great places/lakes to fish. The choice of lodge might depend on American Plan vs Housekeeping, the size of water you are comfortable fishing and type of fish that you want to target. Many lodges close by late September. I offer a few other points to consider. The weather in nw Ontario during September and October can be the best of the best or the worst of the worse. You may encounter both types of weather in the same day. Wind during September and October can really blow! You might find it worthwhile to consider a smaller body of water, rather than Lac Seul or LOTW. I don't recall you mentioning the time of the year that you have previously fished in Ontario. You might be in for a big surprise if you previously fished in spring or early summer. Many walleyes will be considerably deeper than what you have experienced before. I typically am fishing on structure in about 30 fow for walleyes during September and October. This isn't a problem if you are accustomed to fishing this deep on structure. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4186009,BornToFish,2015-09-07 11:09:00,1224,"Wherever you choose to go, you will almost certainly not find a crowd! Many people are chasing deer with bow/arrow, duck hunting, or watching football games back home. September and early October are my favorite times to be fishing in nw Ontario!"
4186049,Matt64,2015-09-07 11:27:00,7,"Thank you for the reply. I should have included more information. Growing up our summer family trip was to Lake of the Woods, Dalseg's Virgin Pine Lodge. Later I started taking my grandfather up who had been fishing there since the 30s. After he passed I returned with my wife a few times. Then we had to give it up for several years. I later returned and moved over to Lac Suel. There we fished mid to late September, early October and ran into that tough weather and winds. For 12 years we fished out of Lac Suel Lodge at their Black Bay Outpost and then the last year out of the main camp. I was younger and had a bigger boat on those trips, this time I will have a 18"" Lund Alaskan with a 60 tiller. While I like Lac Suel I was very interested in some smaller lakes just for the reasons you described. On the other hand returning to LOTW would bring back great memories of growing which would add to the trip. I don't mind fishing deep structure and I have noticed a few camps that are closing up. Matt"
4186073,MN_Moose,2015-09-07 11:39:00,964,Crawfords is ok. Might have to go out past yellow girl to catch walleye. Matt will give you good advice. The cabins are ok. Nothing fancy. During summer it can get a lot of traffic going under the bridge. Take a close look at the dock to make sure they are in good condition no nails exposed. I would suggest you consider Smith Camps near Kenora. Lots of fish structure closer to camp.
4186329,onetimedave,2015-09-07 14:20:00,502,"Don't where you are traveling from but you might look at Kayedon Lake, Melchett Lake both are a short fly in with Arctic Watershed Outposts. Only 1 camp on each lake. Another option is Brace Lake. All three fly out of Nakina."
4187089,ziggyzag,2015-09-07 23:13:00,125,"Onetimedave: All the lakes you mentioned have more than one cabin on them, (3) on Melchett I believe and (2) on Kayedon and Brace is a Lodge with more than one cabin. All are great fishing destinations"
4187313,Matt64,2015-09-08 06:11:00,7,I am looking for a drive in camp. Thank you M
4187329,Matt64,2015-09-08 06:14:00,7,"Thank you, I will check them out. I have never fished out of Kenora so that could add to the adventure."
