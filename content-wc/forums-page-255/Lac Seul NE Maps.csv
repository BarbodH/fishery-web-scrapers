4196009,milfish,2015-09-11 15:20:00,249,Does anyone know if there is a decent GPS map available yet for the NE section of Lac Seul? Say from Bear Narrows North. Thanks
4196713,David Anderson,2015-09-11 21:24:00,2073,I have Navionics Platinum North which includes Lac Seul. No map is 100% accurate however the houseboat routes and the X marks that signify rock are pretty good. The depth contours are very basic but it's much better than nothing.
