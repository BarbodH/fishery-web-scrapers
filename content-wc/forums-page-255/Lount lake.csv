4186689,Daveygravy,2015-09-07 19:12:00,88,"Looking to do a fly in trip next July , I want a good smallmouth & walleye lake. Thinking about Lount lake through Nestor falls fly in. Any info about the lake and or outfitter would be great."
4186849,pan-man,2015-09-07 20:36:00,299,I have been to Lount about 5 years ago. Fishing was lousy but water was 4-5' high. The most important thing is this this does not have to be a fly-in as we camped at Separation lake and just boated to Lount. I am sure it is a good fishing there as I fish normally 25 miles away at Umfreville lake which is part of the same English river system.

I have gone on about 20 fly-in's with them over the years, and everything about their operation is top-notch. Just my opinion, but there is no need to fly in to get great bass fishing. The real attraction in these outposts are the incredible numbers of much-better-than-average sized walleyes."
4189273,Hoosier Boilermaker,2015-09-08 18:12:00,15,"I agree with not having to do a flyin as I camped at Separation Lake campground for about 7 straight years and it was about 30 minute boat ride to Lount Lake. Separation Lake has great small mouth fishing, so you would be passing a lot of good water to get to Lount. Separation Lake Lodge changed hands this summer, don't know anything about the new owners but their lodge is really pretty close to Lount."
4189393,Daveygravy,2015-09-08 18:50:00,88,Thanks for the info on the outfitter. Which lakes have you fished w/them?

4189905,michigan walleye guy,2015-09-08 21:26:00,95,"I have fished Larus Lake each year since 2001 and Clear Lake also the past 5 years. The fishing on Larus is incredible, and Clear, while probably a notch below, is still an awesome lake. If you get a chance, go to their site and look at the new outpost on Larus. It's an absolute palace, in my opinion. Almost too nice for an outpost cabin."
4191089,grindstone,2015-09-09 13:15:00,201,"I fished Lount at least 7 times 15 years back when Bill Kroylik owned it. I'm sure the SM fishing remains top notch. I have buddies who still go every May. For the past 15 years our group has thoroughly enjoyed Moose Point Lodge. The owners Donna and Brad are wonderful. Small mouth are great there as are the walleye. My son caught a 45 1/2"" northern tossing a #3 Mepps at rocks for SM. Looking for a fly in? You would be hard pressed to do better and I have no reason to change so I'll probably never know if a better one exists. They're on the web and feel free to ask me."
4191961,Daveygravy,2015-09-09 18:38:00,88,All their cabins look real nice. They must be a top notch outfit because most of their outposts don't have any openings until August. Thanks for the tip!
4192041,Daveygravy,2015-09-09 19:08:00,88,"Looks like a nice place. Our group tends to like the solitude of 1 cabin lakes. After doing some research, it seems like Lount might not be for us"
