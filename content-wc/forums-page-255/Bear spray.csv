Only a couple of them will read this board and have any idea what it means. I will also be listening to see if I am by chance called a Loogan or a talking bush at any point."

Yes it does.Quote: Originally Posted by SinOrSwimWell, since we are leaving Thursday morning I will try to toss in the word Loogan several times to our group. Only a couple of them will read this board and have any idea what it means. I will also be listening to see if I am by chance called a Loogan or a talking bush at any point. Also listen for ""blind squirrel"", as in ""look, the blind squirrel caught a fish!"" That references the old saying ""sometimes even a blind squirrel can find out a nut"". Good luck on your trip, don't let the loogans grease you out."

4182441,fishman10,2015-09-05 10:07:00,226,"This is a follow p on the fishing etiquette thread. I was on a local lake the other day, fishing a reef, 2 boats spread out giving respect , when a Logan came right in. The boat asked for some room and to show some respect, the Logan started shouting profanities and continued to crowd the boat, UNTIL, the guy pulls out a can of bear spray and fogged them. WOW, never new the impact of this stuff. The Logan learned the hard way. I think he will think twice before doing it again"
4182585,Bobby Winds,2015-09-05 11:15:00,10817,What's a Logan ? ? ?
4182705,lassh,2015-09-05 13:00:00,553,I certainly don't condone crowding in on someone fishing; but spraying them with bear spray is assault and is totally inappropriate. This could have escalated into a situation resulting in a fatality.
4187873,QuikNet,2015-09-08 09:33:00,237,Ya . What is a Logan a person ?????
4187905,Fishoil,2015-09-08 09:36:00,1277,X2!! Bear spray is nothing to mess around with. Think of it as pepper spray on steroids.
4188361,ftfarms,2015-09-08 12:07:00,444,Not to be a a-hole but if he used bear spray it may not hurt them much. Bear spray is not very strong compared to human spray. Bear spray was designed to burn the bears eyes a little not to hurt them. Human spray has 10% or more of oleorsin capsicum. Bear spray has 1-2% oleorsin capsicum. Now bear spray will shoot about twice as far as human spray. Still don't think I would spray someone with it because of there stupidity Oleorsin capsicum is what burns the eyes and can make you pass out and feal sick.

Urban Dictionary: loganwww.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=logan Urban Dictionary Generally a man of great character, possessed of a fabulous sexual magnitism. Courageous, your quintessential knight-in-shining armor type. Some how I think it's not what the op had in mind, I think? Al"
4188505,Mike Borger,2015-09-08 13:13:00,1554,"I think I can help. In my neck of the woods it's a commonly used term to describe an idiot angler encountered while fishing. Problem was it was misspelled, loogan is correct, not logan. Loogan can also be used as an adjective as in ""My God, the looganism here is running rampant!"" Other popular terms are: 1.Rube (a descriptive term coined by carnies to describe the gullible idiots or ""marks"" they target. The term has since been widely adopted by the angling fraternity to describe loogans. and 2.Talking Bush ( this describes people who perform no other role beyond getting in your way. Much like a large bush except these ones talk) What many of you have described as far as people encroaching on your spot and taking it is called ""getting greased out"". The term can also be used as an adjective as in ""Look at that greasy loogan - someone get the bear spray!!"""
4188601,David Anderson,2015-09-08 13:59:00,2073,Great post!!! Does this mean I should get a can of bear spray for my trip on the 21st?
4188665,LOW1,2015-09-08 14:27:00,2828,No one deserves to be assaulted - and the sprayer may well have committed the crime of assault with a deadly weapon. Or going armed with intent or a number of other felonies/crimes.But what's the range of bear spray - 50 feet? It's just nutty to get that close.Where I go there really is no excuse or reason to be within 100 yards. And that may be too close as well.
