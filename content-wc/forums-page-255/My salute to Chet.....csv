He's fished Eagle Lake for longer than I've been here......coming with the grandparents back in the late 40's to Euler's Camp. Three or four years ago it was his ""last trip"" since his Parkinson's had taken it's toll. I was surprised to receive his call that he was coming this fall. His week was tough....physically and fishing wise. He drove the boat, which probably wasn't the best, but he's stubborn. He was also the first fisherman up in the morning....coming down the hill in his walker. It was an effort to get him in the boat. His excitement to get on the water was palpable.......and sad at the same time. This will be his last time. His last day he was able to fish with Gord Euler, who he's known since he was a kid......both now old and declining. They caught some fish which was good. He basically had to crawl out of the boat at the end of the day.......but went right back out after dinner. I passed on Bill Krejca's book ""A Northwoods Fisherman's Story"", which I thought he could relate to. I give Chet credit for doing more than most could, or would, in his situation. I hope I can be half as stubborn when the time comes when I think I can fish no more......."

4197218,Oldschool,2015-09-12 09:28:00,163,Kudos to you for helping him live the best life that he chooses to live. This story speaks as much to the fabric of who you are as to Chet.

I'm feeling very privileged to not have this happen to me or anyone I know. It puts in perspective the health issues that otherx deal with, either themselves or someone they know. My hat goes off to them all...."
4198545,Larry S,2015-09-13 09:04:00,665,Had a friend I worked with who went to Euler's camp for many years. He got his biggest Muskie 28 lbs there. What Camp now was Euler's Camp in the Past?
4198673,v-bay gord,2015-09-13 09:45:00,3168,Euler's camp closed and has been parceled up into smaller properties.
4201298,skindzier,2015-09-14 11:26:00,137,"Gord, I have to admit I got kinda choked up watching him go out to the boat on Friday night while I was getting my boat ready to go. Although I didn't know for sure that was going to be his last trip out, I kinda figured it would be. I know at one point you looked back at me - I was thinking some of the same thoughts as you - I hope I'm that stubborn letting it go too! Thanks again for a great week!"
4202602,Rich B,2015-09-14 19:28:00,1081,"Gord, I appreciate your post and the tribute to Chet Palmer. No doubt has a very loving wife and brother that helped make the week possible for Mr. Palmer at your camp. There is so much more to Northwestern Ontario Sport fishing than just catching fish. Faith, Family, Friends......and fishing, Rich B"
