4132209,pafisher1,2015-08-16 10:12:00,7,"Hi. I am heading up to the gouin aug 28th. I have been up there about 15 times usually the 2nd week of june. So late August is kind of new, its been about 10 years since a late august trip. Just wondering what depths there hitting at im guessing 15 -30 ft. Also how far the water is down from the high water mark on the rocks. Will be fishing west side. thanks"
4132457,octanehi5,2015-08-16 11:42:00,1104,"With the water as warm as it gets they may be as deep as 40', Outfitter?"
4132489,pafisher1,2015-08-16 12:03:00,7,"Thanks. I figured they would be pretty deep that late in August ill try out to 40 ft and in. Would rather not say over the internet, the outfitter doesnt advertise so its not that busy which is nice. I will be fishing lac du male and saraana bay areas all week."
4133993,octanehi5,2015-08-17 03:36:00,1104,good luck
4141633,sbe2,2015-08-19 10:25:00,63,Does the outfitter start with a H?

4146313,pafisher1,2015-08-20 16:20:00,7,"Good to hear, they seem nice I talked to them yesterday and they are letting us go up a day early, one week countdown is on.I will post about our trip, we always do really well in june so hopefully we will do the same this time of the year."
4150769,Freytown,2015-08-22 15:02:00,770,"I fished those waters before Hibou was built. First time I fished was around 1979. Martin Outfitters was the only one there. That area continued to be developed by too many private cabins and then Hibou in the late 80's. In Sept the issue is finding them in good numbers. Fish should be at about 30ft following the bait. My best walleye fishing was in those early years, oh the memories. Good luck"
4150833,pafisher1,2015-08-22 15:49:00,7,"Thanks freytown, my great uncle has been fishing the area since the late 60s it definitely had changed over the years we fished martins for many years mainly when pete owned the camp. Have had to travel further over the years to find good numbers . Thinking about trying east side of the gouin next year for something different."
