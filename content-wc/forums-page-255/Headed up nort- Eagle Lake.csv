Just checking to see if anyone has any last minute advice or instructions for a couple Eagle Lake virgins. Darker water in the south part of the lake and we are told crawlers don't work well. Minnows are $5.60 doz. We assume walleyes are still 25-30' deep. We like to use flashy jigs but PJ Shorthorn hooked me up with a bunch of Lindy rigs. Which approach do you use? Advice on colors. We have caught some smaller muskies (38"") but Randy at Century Lodge is quite sure we are going to tie in to big muskie and won't know how to handle them. Any input is welcome. We usually catch smallies on jig and twister and occasionally a beetle spinner. Randy thinks small crankbaits are best. We would appreciate any Eagle sages throwing us a few pointers since we are really anxious to go and will be checking WC every few minutes! Fish On! Hooks"
4185537,NARDA 1,2015-09-07 07:49:00,636,"Just came back from Eagle on 8/30/15, we stayed at Birch Dale Lodge at the north end of the lake. We were walleye fishing in 35 - 45 FOW on rock humps/reefs using Lindy Rigs (no spinner) shortened to 24 - 30"" using minnows. We did quite well but I seemed to be only able to catch 16"" fish, it was like they were cloning them under the boat!! All in all it was a great week. I also heard from several Musky fisherman that they were seeing and catching some nice fish. Good luck and have a great time!"
4185617,law57,2015-09-07 08:32:00,1147,Here's hoping you have a good trip! It's hard not to right? I might be leaving Saturday - I'll call the lodge Wed or Thursday after I see what the weather will be like. I don't want to be up there if it's going to blow and be cold/rainy. But I think it will be nice. If they have a cabin I'll go. Their water lines are shallow. So they start draining them early to avoid freeze-up. They keep a few cabins 'wet' for bear hunters. Usually I can sneak in a fall trip. I live on a very dark water lake. We use crawlers all summer. I was out last week catching crappie and blue gill and walleye on crawlers. I like minnows in the fall too. But don't give up on crawlers because of water color. Walleye have other senses besides sight.
4186273,prov1800,2015-09-07 14:00:00,5010,I guided all last werk in the east section of eagle.lot of people fishing real deepmactually to deep.catching fish at those depths is a death sentence for a walleye.no need to fish that deep.there are plenty of fish on shallow humps and weed beds.all those deep fish are normally all small and a waste of time sitting over top of them feeding them minnows and killing them.surprised camp owners dont educate there guests more.any definatly use minnows and fish shallower.less fish but bigger ones and fish the 10-12 ft cabbage if you can find it.but caught them in 5 ft also.down in osborne they will be shallower as well.
4186553,HeHooksHimself,2015-09-07 16:54:00,725,"Keep it coming, all good stuff. Prov I saw your post about deep walleye. Will keep that in mind. Hooks"
4186785,rzep,2015-09-07 19:54:00,1196,"I spent week at Century lodge 6 or 7 years ago ..cought my first Musky right off the shore while trying to become comfortable with my first bsitcastingv setup. It was ,42-44...so excited that took pics and threw fish back...seems as this is place where Musky guys go as pretty much everyone else at the dinner was talking Muskies. I liked the place cause they allowed dogs and since this is an island I did not have to worry about him running away in the woods. Still the cabins were run down....hope they fixed things up..."
4189681,Eyes_R_Us,2015-09-08 20:15:00,66,"The best advice I can give you about handling Muskie or any large fish is in the Muskie tips section on Gord's web page for Vermillion Bay Lodge: http://www.vermilionbaylodge.com/mus...hing-tips.html Read the whole thing and follow his advice especially about number of hooks, barbless (or flattened barb) hooks and keeping the fish in the net in the water as you unhook it. My son and I read all the tips on Gords web page before we went to Eagle a few years back. That year we hooked a nice Muskie and a similar Northern. Managing the un-hook was safe and easy and both fish were released in excellent condition. Now we fish with barbless hooks 100% of the time - even for walleye. I can't say that I have ever lost a fish because of this practice. If we happen to hook a walleye in the esophagus it comes right out with a pair of curved hemostats. Good luck. I go to Eagle lake almost every year but have never been to that part of the lake. You will have a great time I'm sure"
4190153,HeHooksHimself,2015-09-09 04:31:00,725,"Leave it to Gord to have the simple, easy-to-read, amusing and comprehensive Muskie handling article. Thanks, I hope to be putting all of this information to good use. Heading out tomorrow. Hooks"
4190713,v-bay gord,2015-09-09 10:22:00,3168,"My internet has been down for a few days. I was having withdrawals! Last few days guests have been catching walleye quite shallow.....12 feet last evening......and that's in the clear water in Vermilion Bay. I would expect a shallow bite in Osbourne. Don't overlook trolling cranks for walleye....it's been working here to some extent. One of my guests this week (Skindzeir?) has fished Osbourne quite a bit in the past and went there yesterday (trailered his boat down)........boated two muskies........so I would say you should have luck as well. Re: Prov's observation about camps not educating their guests. I agree. This past week I've been watching a flotilla (what camp travels in packs....some will know but I won't say) fish the 50 foot depths between Colonels and Round Island. Very disappointing and frustrating. That said I have a regular guest who refuses to believe the obvious....because he ""observes"" the fish swimming back to the bottom on his locator. An educated man, but blind to the obvious. Sorry, not meaning to hijack the thread. Have a great time in Osbourne Bay. Try trolling smaller musky baits if things get tough casting........"
4191073,HeHooksHimself,2015-09-09 13:09:00,725,I hope to be trying your place in the near future. For now I am just itching to get the heck outta Dodge. I'll splash the water in Osbourne Bay and when the ripple hits Vermilion Bay you will know it is me saying hi. Hooks
