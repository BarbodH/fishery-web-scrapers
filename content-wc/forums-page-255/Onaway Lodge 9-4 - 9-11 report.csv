The owners, Blair & Kathy, were friendly, the cabin was great and the dock was the best I've seen.We stayed in cabin #3. It sleeps 12 (not counting the hideaway beds) with a 8 person minimum. It has 6 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a double kitchen with 2 stoves, 2 refrigerators, 2 counter areas, microwave, 2 4-slice toasters and both a large and small coffee pot. It's basically a cabin with a mirror image flipped over on the other side with the double kitchen, large table that seats 12 and living area with a wood stove in the center and at least 6 couches. It's also one of the closest cabins to the dock. 8 of us were very comfortable. The fish cleaning area was large, well set up and part of the dock area that had an open grid type floor over the lake so standing water or puddles were not an issue. The dock had many outlets near each slip for charging. The owners topped off the tanks in each boat every day except the last day. The cabin rate includes 30 gallons of gas and 21 dozen minnows per boat. We didn't exceed either in our stay so we had no additional cost for gas or minnows.On the other hand, I can't think of many good things to say about the weather. The first day was warm and sunny. From then on it got colder, wetter, and windier. The middle 4 days were very windy. That made some of the favored spots difficult to get to and very hard to fish. The last 5 days were all cloudy with the occasional rain or mist. Nothing kept us off the lake, but it was difficult with some pounding rides across open water. It's a bit of a ride from Onaway out to the fishing areas, but I'm sure i wouldn't have minded it as much with less wind.We hired Prov1800 to guide us on the first day and it worked out well. As you can tell by his posts, he is an interesting guy and was great to work with. With him in one of our boats and the other three following he lead us to several spots that we fished the rest of the week. It was also helpful to get down some safe GPS routes around the lake. Fishing was good except for one day. I've never fished NW Lac Seul before so I can't say if it was better or worse than usual. We didn't get a lot of fish but we got some large fish. The largest was 27.25"" and one guy (Walleyeski) had 13 fish over 24"". Day 5 started for me with a 24.25"" and 23.5"" near the waterfall at South Inlet right away and then it shut down for our boat and turned out to be our worst day. We were supposed to have fish that night, but by 2PM our boat was thinking about spaghetti. Fortunately the other boats had a better day and fish stayed on the menu that night. The walleyes tended to be large or too small, however. To go along with the large fish we got a lot of little walleyes and saugers. Getting fish in the 16-18"" range was tough. Very few northerns and a handful of perch were caught. Some of our best spots were near Shanty Narrows East and Manitoba Point. Most of our fish came from 20-25', but we also caught some as shallow as 10' and the largest walleye came from 40'. We used primarily minnows on lindy rigs or jigs but one boat also got some fish trolling crank-baits over weeds in Bay of Islands.We had 8 guys with 4 boats. Fortunately we had 4 radios with us also. On one of the windiest days I was barely able to hear one of the boats radio that they were broke down on an island. It sounded like they said Bay of Islands so we headed that way. Fortunately, they were near our usual route, so we found them fairly quickly and were able to tow them back to Onaway.8 guys that got along well, good food, and some big fish weren't defeated by cool temperatures, rain and strong winds. So, all in all, it was a pretty good trip."
4198905,MikeinMN,2015-09-13 12:04:00,190,"Our group was in that area of the lake about a week earlier than your group. We had the best weather our group has ever had. I think that is the risk of coming up so late in the season. Really starting to transition to fall weather there. We never fish it in spring or early summer, so I've never really seen the crowds I hear folks complain about, which is one of the good parts about late season. I don't hear of it much on this board, but we have had a few days where we were ""thinking about spaghetti"". I think hiring a guide right away was a pretty good idea, it took a while for us to be consistent on Lac Seul, especially when we had windy conditions that kept us from fishing where we wanted.It's a really impressive lake for numbers and size of walleyes, and a good day on that lake is as good as anywhere I've fished and better than most. Since you mentioned it was your first Lac Seul trip, I was wondering if your group liked it enough so you're coming back next year, and if you're coming again late season."
4199465,prov1800,2015-09-13 18:04:00,5010,"It was a pleasure to be in the boat with you and randy,and am glad we had the weather we had that day with your crew.as far as the fishing went that day i would consider it a decent day we had but far from a great day.you can never tell what your week will be like any time of the fishing season especially into mid September.i know i guided some folks on the wednesday and that wind got real ugly and scary.think thats the day you guys had to tow the boat in.but i am sure you gutd saw the potential the lake has and can now only imagine it on a good week.hope to see you guys next year."
4199577,stjoeguy,2015-09-13 18:35:00,979,"Some of the guys would return to Onaway in a heartbeat but I'm not sure if I'll return to Lac Seul or not at this point. This is only my 2nd year for a Sept. trip. Last year I fished Abram/Minnitaki for 3 days and Lac Seul out of Deception Bay for 2 days. On the one hand, I'd like to use Sept. to try other lakes. On the other hand, I always compares other lakes to Lake St. Joseph, which I've fished every June for over a dozen years, and they never come close so maybe I should just make a Sept. trip back to St. Joe. I do see the potential of Lac Seul. We caught some large fish but just ran into a stretch of ugly weather. With better weather and a year's experience I'm sure next year would be even better. If I go back to Lac Seul it will be in Sept. again. There was some boat traffic but it was not as bad as it sounds in June according to Walleye Central posts. I know I wouldn't enjoy crowds. Bad weather can happen anytime so I think I'll continue to gamble on September. I really liked Onaway but would consider another lodge if it were closer to fishing spots. Thanks again, John. I was in the boat following you, Todd and Randy and really liked getting good tracks that we followed all week and some spots that we returned to over and over."
4199673,prov1800,2015-09-13 19:09:00,5010,"I understand where you are coming from.but big water big waves.been on lake st joseph and have seen waves as big and bigger than lac suel.i fish minnitaki also and abram and they to can be brural.i am sure today again was brutal on lac suel with big winds from the south.i was on cedar today.it was just choppy and manageable, those are the options i have being a rogue.lol.bad days you could easily pull your boat out and go to a smaller lake.small lakes have big fish to.keep in touch."
4200210,MikeinMN,2015-09-13 23:31:00,190,"Lake St. Joseph is definitely on the list of places I'd like to fish, but I think that trip is a little more expensive than Lac Seul and will probably have to wait a few years. Nice for me to hear Lake St. Joseph directly contrasted with the area of Lac Seul I'm familiar with. I'm curious about your experience fishing both ends of Lac Seul at the same time of year also. Did you prefer one over the other?"
4200754,stjoeguy,2015-09-14 08:15:00,979,"We only had 2 days at Lac Seul last year and only got from the Deception Bay landing as far as Sen Bay, so we didn't really get far enough or fish long enough to make a real comparison, but I think the fishing was better this year up at the NW end of the lake. Walleyes were larger for us this year. The highlight of last year's trip for me was the fish that got away. I ""snagged"" a log that started moving and eventually jumped out of the water once. It was too quick a glimpse for me to tell if it was a northern or a musky, but it was huge. Being a fisherman with the ability to exaggerate, and having never caught a musky, I'm adding ""almost caught a musky"" to my list. Check out Camp Lake St. Joseph for a less expensive trip to that lake. The facilities aren't anything like Onaway and it's a 30 minute ride out to most of the fishing areas from there, but that ride's comparable to those on Lac Seul."
