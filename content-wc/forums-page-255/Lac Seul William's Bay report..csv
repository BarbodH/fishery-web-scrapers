BE WARNED .only travel the Silver Water Wheel route turning left off the north road just past Blueberry lake if coming up from Dryden, the other way just past KM38 is washed out, apparently a 6 feet drop either side of a washout. Also the landing is a mess .I don't even want to take my boat there, and its a piece of junk! Anyway, fishing was awesome as was the weather and company. We got most fish at 17' to 22' and were using large minnows on jigs. Fish would turn on and off pretty quick so we moved around a little bit. My friend's son was with us and he was first to catch a fish. It was his biggest walleye and his reaction when he was catching these linkers was worth the trip alone GOOD TIMES.VIDEOhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYbUlY7x_qs"
