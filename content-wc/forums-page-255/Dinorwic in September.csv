4186361,cspierings,2015-09-07 14:32:00,230,I'm about a week away from some time on dinowic lake. Can anyone provide any advice on what to expect in mid September? I think we will largely fish for perch walleye and smallies. Thanks

We did our best catching in Lake Minehaha, or something like that. It is attached to Dinorwic, I think on the west side, but not sure, check a map. I do know that it was 18.2 miles from camp. The fish that we caught were all 20""-26"". That was a blast in that depth. The water temps are a lot warmer now, so I am guessing that the fish will be on humps, off points, and weeds; in about 12'-17' of water. Ggod fishin', and tight lines."
