4184153,BornToFish,2015-09-06 11:20:00,1224,"We purchased frozen minnows from Bobby's in Vermillion Bay last spring. They were rather large, and if I remember correctly, imported from Peru. We used them under slip bobbers for northern pike during the opening week. I don't remember the price of these frozen sucker-like minnows. We also purchased frozen shiner minnows in Red Lake this summer. One batch came from the grocery store in Red lake. I believe these came from Winnipeg. The other batch came from a private, licensed bait dealer in Red Lake. I believe both sources were about $4 per 150 grams. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4186513,Fishoil,2015-09-07 16:36:00,1277,"Here's the thread with the directions for salting minnows: https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...hlight=salting The only thing I've started to do different is the rinsing. I've gotten lazy and now dump then in a colander after the day of refrigeration and rinse them thoroughly. I've found it much easier than grabbing them by the handful. Also, when fishing with them I keep a small container full of water and drop a handful of them in. By doing this you don't get the salt in the cuts on your fingers and the minnows are easier to work with."
4191001,MikeG1,2015-09-09 12:29:00,434,"I've read to rehydrate the salted minnows in gulp solution. Anyone do this? Directions were to only place enough minnows that you would use in an hour, not rehydrate a large bunch. It sounded interesting and something I plan to try in the future. Let me know if anyone has experience."
4191329,Lovetofish,2015-09-09 14:57:00,458,Both trips this year I used a wet fish rag and put 5-10 minnows wrapped in it. When it started to dry out just soak it in the lake. Kept them moist and out of the sun and that worked just fine.
4192625,stevensinks,2015-09-10 07:03:00,330,Born To Fish Which bait shop in Red Lake did you find them at ? It would be good to know for next year. Thanks
4192889,BornToFish,2015-09-10 08:14:00,1224,"The ""we"" in my earlier post was my lodge-owner friend. I was with him both times he purchased frozen shiner minnows for his lodge. He purchased several cases of frozen shiner minnows from the IGA in Red Lake. I believe these came from Winnipeg. The minnows (150 g.) were in plastic tubs. I don't know if they were pre-ordered or if they are available in quantities smaller than a case. The other place we picked up frozen shiners was from a private bait dealer (licensed) that operates from his home in Red Lake. His name is ""Barry"". That's all I can offer on this source. His frozen shiners (150 g.) were also in plastic tubs. I believe that you can also get frozen minnows from Clark's on Cedar lake. Clark's is a very well known bait dealer in the Vermillion Bay area and owns several lodges/businesses in the area. I don't know if these are a ""special order"" or if they are a standard stocking item. You might want to give Wayne a call. You might also check out Bobby's in Vermillion Bay. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4181297,CycloneWalleyeHunter,2015-09-04 16:04:00,18,"Heading to Canada in a couple of weeks and was wondering about using salted fresh minnows as a supplement to our normal live minnows. I'm curious as to their effectiveness, where to get them, crossing the border with them and any other information you can share with me. Appreciate the info!"
4181433,michigan walleye guy,2015-09-04 17:34:00,95,"Salted minnows are a good back-up to other live baits. You can get a half gallon of salted fatheads at www.minnesotabaitandtackle.com for $26, or a whole gallon for $42. The minnows are a bit on the small side, so I usually used them with a twister tail to add some ""bulk"" to the offering, usually on a quarter-ounce jig. Shipping will set you back another $15, but the salties arrive in great shape. I recommend them. I've used them the past two summers. Good luck."

4181897,tim.123,2015-09-05 06:18:00,13,We used salties this last summer and were very pleased with the results. We too teamed them with plastic. Only way to go for my money.
4181961,BornToFish,2015-09-05 06:42:00,1224,"I read a thread about salties on this forum about two years ago. FishOil posted a recipe for salting fathead minnows. His recipe worked great, aas advertised. You should be able to retrieve the thread by conducting a search. I salt a pound of fatheads for about $13.00. The salties worked very well for me, especially in the spring when the presentations are more horizontal. The walleyes don't have the luxury of time to study the minnow. They have to eat or let it go by. I've noticed that salties didn't work quite as well as live minnows in the autumn, when the presentation is more vertical. It seems as though the walleyes can study the salties, such that live minnows work better. I offer three points to consider. First, FishOil strongly recommended against freezing the salted minnows. I kept my salties refrigerated, such that they didn't become mushy. Second, you will get salt on your hands and fishing equipment. I noticed a small amount of pitting on my reel spools. Fortunately, most of this came off with some soap/water and a bristle brush. You will find out how many nicks/cuts/scrapes are on your hands! Third, the salties are more fragile than live minnows. I noticed that I would often get the head of the minnow back when I missed a bite. I overcame this by going to a jig with a longer shank. I hooked the salted minnow through the eye, such that the hook was moved a bit closer to the tail. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
4181985,JAY221,2015-09-05 06:48:00,877,"We used salted minnows this year for the first time with very good luck. I had emailed Minnesota Bait & Tackle & he hooked me up with Fish Lake Bait Shop which is @ the Harris Minnesota exit on Interstate 35 as we were going right by there it worked out well for us. It was a good mix of minnows & they work! Later, Jay"
4182329,Manitou,2015-09-05 09:19:00,125,Due to the live bait restrictions in Manitoba they are a very popular item there.Not so much in Ontario. Live bait is the go-to there but I bet the salties will work just fine too.
4182721,lassh,2015-09-05 13:04:00,553,"As far as inflaming the hands, I think handling Gulp is worse than salted minnows."
4183537,Carnhzkr,2015-09-05 22:26:00,964,"Keep in mind that you cannot buy frozen minnows in Ontario. Not sure why, but I was told at a bait shop in Kenora that it's illegal to sell them in ON. It's legal to use them and legal to bring them in, but not to sell them."
4184041,Bill Krejca,2015-09-06 09:54:00,6107,"I'm maybe interested in picking up some salted minnows. Looked up Fish Lake Bait Shop. Web site is down, one goggle answer says it is closed? Anybody know? Thanks. Bill"
