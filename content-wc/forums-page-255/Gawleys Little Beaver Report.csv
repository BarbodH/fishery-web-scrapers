Great accomodations and great owners made for a unforgettable week. We found fish on just about every reef and point that we stopped to fish, caught them anywhere from 3' to 21' of water. Fished Steamboat and Mckenzie bay both were excellent. As always jigs and minnows were key. The weather was perfect nice smooth going. I was surprised at how few of boats we seen on the water. We also got into a really good bite near lunker point one day which was great because of its close proximity camp. Water temp was approaching 70 degrees all week.We also marked plenty of large schools of bait fish.Some of the notable fish for the week were1- 27.5""1- 26.5""3- 25""too many to count between 19 to 24""way too many to count between 14 to 18""7 30"" northerns"

Fought the wind and rain for most of the week, but the fish were biting. Our largest fish for the week was 26 inches, but we caught 5 of those in our group. Can wait to get back to see Doug and Gayle again next year."
