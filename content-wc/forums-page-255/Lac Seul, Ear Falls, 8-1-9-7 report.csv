This was the first year in 10 or so years on Lac Seul that both boats had equally great fishing. In my boat, jigs with minnows or half crawlers produced the most and biggest fish, but crankbaits also did well, and we caught a few on slip bobbers too, for whatever reason we didn’t try bouncers and spinners this year. Best depth was from 2-23 feet, but mostly shallower than 17’. Jig color did not seem to matter much, cranks were better if they had some orange on them. Lots of 18-22” and a few mid 20” walleyes as well as plenty of eaters, and more small (8-12”) than we have seen before. More incidental pike (very small to 33” or so) and smallmouth (12- 17”) than any other year. Mostly fished McKenzie Bay, but a few spots closer to camp were good too. Weather: 62-85 during the days, most days were sunny and calm. A little light rain/mist 2 mornings. Usually started cloudy, then cleared by noon or so. Not much for wind other than a breeze most days. Maybe a couple hours of 10-15 mph wind the windiest day. I know some guys like the walleye chop, but give me calmer waters on Lac Seul any time. This weather was about perfect! Water temp from 67-71. Water level seemed normal to me. Lodging: Stayed at Gawley’s Little Beaver just south of Ear Falls. Never stayed anywhere else on Lac Seul and never will. Great camp owners, free unlimited ice, electric on the dock, cleanest fish house I’ve ever been in, clean air conditioned cabins, internet, satellite TV, minnows available, and very reasonable rates.Drive: There is a bit of construction still on 71 and 105. Some of the road crew was staying next door and told us it’s expected to last until October (freeze up) this year and then go again for the next 2 summers. We had some delay because of one lane traffic, but nothing major. I did not get the “black goo” on my truck/trailer either, but it did get muddy. Especially on 71 slow down for the culvert construction, I think my trailer wheels came off the ground at one! Crossed customs in at Baudette and out at I-Falls with no wait and no problems either way."
