4190529,Mike Borger,2015-09-09 08:17:00,1554,"Nope, but two hours further north on 11 in Temagami there's Lakeland Airways:http://lakelandairways.ca/Sudbury due west of North Bay has Sudbury Aviation:http://www.sudburyaviation.on.ca/"
4190537,adempsey,2015-09-09 08:24:00,963,"Not as far as I know. The closest would be Port Loring, Sudbury and Temagami.Tornado's Resorts flies out of Port Loring and Rainbow Airways flies out of Ardbeg, both of which aren't too far south of North Bay. Lakeland Airways flies out of Temagami. They are also chartered by Wishin' You Were Fishin'.Sudbury Aviation flies out of Sudbury."

Wishin you were fishin just has 2 lakes they fly into.In the old days we used to do fly in ice fishing trips up the French river.We used to stack walley up like cord wood.The limit was six in those days.This was almost 40 yrs ago. The planes took off from Trout lake ,which is just east of North Bay.They may still be there.Lakeland runs a real good operation,great pilot.I will be on that plane this Saturday morning."
