1529996,dhottle,2013-01-28 14:50:00,163,I have shared that experience as well. Pretty cool for all three.
1529525,drlee,2013-01-27 13:02:00,409,"Does anyone know anything about northern Ontario fly in fishing camps that feature hard surface landings, rather than float plane type access? I await the remarkable wisdom contained within the contributing members of the Walleye Central Message Board! (does that compliment help encourage responses?)"

1529551,SinOrSwim,2013-01-27 14:38:00,1528,"Here is one but I think the guy that owns it is a jerk. We flew into his main lodge and then boated to an outpost many years ago. It EASILY ranks as the worst trip we have ever taken in almost 20 years. He had sold the outpost cabins and we were his last group. He was essentially done in his mind with that portion of his business and all the stuff that was promised was not provided. He also owns Dick and Nelly's restaurant and Sunset Inn in Sioux Lookout as well I believe. He used to anyway.His main lodge was very very nice though. I will also say the person who purchased his camps was so good at trying to fix the situation at the end and flying us back to Fort Frances, we ended up using him as our outfitter for about 12 years before he sold some of his cabins. It was Verne with Slate Falls Outposts and he is easily the BEST outfitter we have ever had. http://www.guardianeagle.com/"
1529561,adempsey,2013-01-27 14:51:00,963,In that video someone posted recently they landed on a beach. Does that count?
1529576,fishguide1800,2013-01-27 15:22:00,84,Not sure how gaurdian eagle is going to run this year with dick passing away
1529578,LeeMB,2013-01-27 15:41:00,83,there are quite a few lodges with stripes in Manitoba
1529610,drlee,2013-01-27 17:13:00,409,"Thanks for the quick response guys...guess you are influenced by compliments! BTW, I flew in with Vern to Lake St. Joseph several times a few years back and you are right..he is the best! Also, will check out Manitoba...never been there, but would be a new and interesting experience. Thanks again!"
1529612,drlee,2013-01-27 17:18:00,409,"No...I am nervous enough about taking off and especially, landing on the water. I saw the video, too. I am not sure why, since I have flown in before on several occasions, but I have developed a fear of float planes. I guess it started when I read about the accident out of Sioux Lookout some years ago where a plane flipped over on pilot error and all three occupants drowned. Can't imagine a worse fate. I know...it is a rare event and likely an unfounded fear, but it is there for me."
1529714,phishfearme,2013-01-27 21:54:00,1242,way north lodge flys out of red lake and lands at an old gold mine landing strip - then a bumpy bus ride to the boats then to the lodge or cabins. phish
