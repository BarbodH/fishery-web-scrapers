We are looking at a one day deal and bigger Walleye instead of numbers. I've heard rumours of this lake, but would like some personal thoughts or any other lakes for bigger Walleye.Thanks"

1531048,teddi,2013-01-30 17:29:00,349,There are big walleyes in the lake as well as numbers. I used to have a boat on the lake for years but took it out after the road went to s###.
1531229,phishfearme,2013-01-31 06:59:00,1242,faron offered us a one day fly-in to either zinzania or rainfall - we did rainfall and had a great day with walleye (large average size - 19inches or so) and large pike. can you afford to go to each? phish
1531245,jkrawchu,2013-01-31 07:56:00,26,"Would like to think that we could afford both, but we are doing our usual trip to Lac Seul and wanted to do a fly-in the day before we start at our lodge. A friend of ours went on a one-day trip a few years ago and said it was unreal and big Walleye. Just trying to get information on which outfitter/lake to go to."
1531267,go dart,2013-01-31 08:22:00,77,Love that lake and have fished it at least 5 times. There are big sow walleyes in there along with big pike. All the points hold walleyes and sometimes in great numbers. We have actually fished with bare abdereen hooks and caught one after another but the big walleyes are loners and found on off bank structure. Theres excellent structure just east of the big rock island. We've caught several large ones in that area. Take a portable finder. The whole operation is very professional.
