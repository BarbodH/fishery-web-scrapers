1518556,LOWeyes,2013-01-01 12:47:00,3,Where are you going in June?
1518618,wallydave,2013-01-01 16:04:00,2151,"If your asking me, we'll be at Goose Bay! If your around stop by!"
1518698,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2013-01-01 19:45:00,629,"Now that US HWY #11 on the US side of the Rainy River has been improved between Baudette, Mn. & Int. National Falls I want to explore & learn more about Rainy Lake/USA & Canadian waters during the 2013 open water season."
1518718,Glenman12,2013-01-01 20:40:00,762,I vow to jig more than 50% of the time...always swear we're gonna do it but it never happens..
1531269,wallydave,2013-01-31 08:24:00,2151,"Pooch emailed me about a remodeling sale at the local Gander Mountain, up to 40% off on fishing tackle!! Pretty tempting, I could give myself a nice b-day present!...Then I look at my gear, took advantage of the new Bass Pro trade-in special last spring, new rods and reels! Thanks to a fall clearance a couple years ago, I picked up a nice light and ultra lite rig! None of my fish sticks are more than a couple years old. Jig and cranks..got new stuff that has never even gotten wet!! Sigh.. I'll have to work on that in June!!"
1517385,wallydave,2012-12-28 08:20:00,2151,"With the New Year just a few days away now, and my first trip North with just my wife and I, I know next June's trip will be different than every other trip. So I am planning on some areas of the lake to explore, and new methods too! I love jigging, but I resolve to try bottom bouncing and three way rigging while I explore the new areas of the NW end of Lac Seul. I will also try Not to buy anymore fishing tackle for the 2013 trip!! Really I mean it ...this time??Anybody else?"
1517502,HeHooksHimself,2012-12-28 14:54:00,725,"I resolve to leave that ""just in case"" tub I bring every year where it is, in my basement. you know the one that has a compass, extra rope, that headband flashlight, about 7 dull filet knives that box of lures that havent been wet in ten years. There is also that spool of ten year old 6 lb. monofilament line, the box of swisher sweets from 06, three old fishing hats and the sunglasses with one of the lens missing. Oh yeah, I am gonna try to sneak a beer on the boat this year, don't tell Barney in the yellow plane or those teetotalers on WC!"
1517517,2746,2012-12-28 16:22:00,3206,Sounds like a duplicate of mine.....except it's a bag and resides in the garage. Might I suggest having a second thought about the 7 year old swisher sweets. Throw them in the boat.....they'll go good with that beer your gonna sneek on!
1517566,wallydave,2012-12-28 21:08:00,2151,Cigars are always an important of a Canadian trip! Hey you have to keep the Royal Canadian Airforce at bay somehow!!
1518049,labsrus,2012-12-30 19:25:00,557,"Fish more and try new spots on the lake As far as sneaking a few beers, I AGREE Need to catch more fish with jigs this year"
1518060,jkonop,2012-12-30 19:43:00,544,"""Not to buy anymore fishing tackle""...That is funny..."
1518088,JAMOKIN,2012-12-30 21:18:00,48,My resolution is to get out onto the ice and water more.I live in Manitoba with great hard and soft water fishing within an hour drive and dont get out often enough.Damm wife.I wonder if I can put her on Kijiji and trade up to one that wants to fish.(and alot younger and bigger uh- you know what I mean ).HAPPY NEW YEAR
1518123,"6'3""",2012-12-31 06:29:00,47,I had decided I wasn't going to buy any more lures also. Then I was in Meijer a week ago and they had some Shad Raps and X-Raps on sale for 3.41 each. What's a man to do?
1518127,wallydave,2012-12-31 06:57:00,2151,You got those raps on sale and its still 2012!! I have today off and some Bass Pro gift cards! I may just try to beat the deadline!!
1518222,Duflebag,2012-12-31 11:07:00,218,"He Hooks, You must have looked in my ""Just in case"" bag. The only things you forgot are the five 1/4 rolls of toilet paper in the plastic bag and six almost empty bic lighters. Too funny.....but....You never know when it all might come in handy!"
