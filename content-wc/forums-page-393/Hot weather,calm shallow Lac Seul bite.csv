1529871,Knoxabilly,2013-01-28 10:46:00,225,I caught my biggest Walleye 30.5 off clay banks in 4ft in May last year. I've been going to Lac Seul for 16yrs and have caught tons of walleyes in 4ft or less. So much fun- I hate deep water fishing so maybe I just always try the shallow water but it always produces for me
1528000,btmbncr,2013-01-24 02:29:00,492,"Years ago I stumbled into shallow water walleyes during real hot weather.Last summer on Lac Seul we were on fish on the windward side of a long rock reef,in 14 to 16 feet.The wind died,it was hot and it got calm.While unhooking and releasing a fish I run up on top of the reef in about 7 to 8 feet of water.I stopped the trolling motor and my wife dropped her bouncer,hook with a colored bead and leech over the side.Wham she hooked a nice fish before it hit bottom.The fish was 28 inches.I eased us back and forth on top of the reef and we caught fish after fish mostly overs.The bite lasted for close to 2 hours then a breeze came up.The fish slid back out to 12 to 14 feet.I found fish in shallow rocks twice more on the trip,hot and calm.This was the end of July,first part of August. Have any of you also found this going on when your up on Lac Seul in July and August?Bill"
1528029,orchard frank,2013-01-24 06:01:00,1900,"Have also used this pattern. With a couple hot/calm days in a row, staying back and throwing cranks into water as shallow as 2-4' has produced some very good action."
1528098,Pooch,2013-01-24 08:04:00,4619,"Have done the same thing a couple times by accident several years ago. Hot. high sun, no clouds, tiny breeze and to me no reason for any fish to be in a couple feet or less of water. Too many rocks to safely navigate in. Slowly eased our way out. Probably could have almost waded.Wasn't smart enough at the time to throw cranks.Pooch"
1528336,Mike Kansas,2013-01-24 14:44:00,1463,Have had the same thing happen many times on Lac Seul. My theory is that the calm warm water contains high volumes of plancten which draws the minnows and we all know Walleyes Love Minnows. Mike Kansas
1528350,SinOrSwim,2013-01-24 15:04:00,1528,I was fishing on a fly-in years ago and both of us had a fish on. Our lines got all tangled and we were trying to get everything taken care of after I cut the motor. Wasn't paying attention at all and the next thing you know we were up against the shore on a small island. I was still dinking with my line when my boat partner dropped his line over the edge of the boat. We were literally in 3 to 4 feet of water. We sat there and caught walleye like we were catching perch or bluegills. Just dropping a hook over the side of the boat without having to reel in. There were some small ones and some in the slot but almost everything was 18 to 22 inches. It lasted about an hour.
1528487,jWN,2013-01-24 20:01:00,62,Here in Iowa at lake RATHBUN some of the best walleye fishing is 2 ft or less when it is unbearably hot out and no wind. I always figured this must happen else where also but this is the first other time I have read about it.
1528495,wallydave,2013-01-24 20:19:00,2151,One trip to Lac Seul in early July the windy points along the cloudy waters were great fishing! Plenty of walleyes and pike on jigs n minnows!
1528522,fishguide1800,2013-01-24 21:10:00,84,"LAC SUEL is awesome,theres many of those kind of spots and shallow weed beds,but this goes on like that on any lakes here,if you have found a spot or two,then you can go to them when normall fisjing slows done,go and try them places and they just be on fire again"
1529552,Jigger1,2013-01-27 14:39:00,234,"Biggest walleye I've ever seen landed in my boat was caught by my father-in-law pitching a jig into shore. He landed the jig in about 6Â” of water pulled it out a couple pops and caught a 30.5 in less than 2' of water. Dead calm, warm day on LacSeul."
1529808,WalleyeWally28,2013-01-28 09:07:00,298,"I think this is very common, at least on LS. My Wife and I have fished LS around the end of June for the last 16 years, but have been making a second trip early to mid August the past five. We didn't know what to expect our first August, but everyone in camp said we needed to fish in 20'-25'. The first day out was sunny, hot and calm and we were trolling a shoreline at the suggested depth. We came up to a point and started around it. It suddenly got very shallow, and as we tried to get to deeper water, we started to catch eyes in 3'-8'. The weather stayed the same for the next two days and everytime we stopped at that point we found them stacked on top of the bar. The fourth day the weather changed and they were gone.Another August we were down in the main basin working the windward side of one of our favorite islands. It was again hot and sunny but the wind was fairly strong. We were having no luck in the wind so we moved around to the leeward side. For whatever reason they were stacked in there shallow.A third example was a very hot, sunny and calm day in the main basin and we pulled in alongside of a sandbar with a weedbed running down the side of it. The bite was fantastic in and along the weeds in shallow water. Mostly caught slots and overs. Went back the next day and nothing. After we got home I checked the SWWL guide report for that week and saw that they had the same experience - shallow in the weeds one day and gone the next.We have had other similar experiences but these stand out in my mind. I guess that's what makes fishing LS so much fun and keeps bringing us back year after year."
