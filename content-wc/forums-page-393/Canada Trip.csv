1529321,Richard B,2013-01-26 20:49:00,735,This summer I am attempting to take a good friend of mine up to Canada for a fishing trip. He is retired and has not been able to afford any kind of trip for the last 5 or 6 years. He is demanding that he pay for his ½ of the lodging cost and his fishing license. We will be taking my boat. Housekeeping plan. I have found 3 different resorts that are a total of approximately $600 for the week based on just the 2 people. . Mackenzie Lodge  On Lake of the Woods and is located in Pine Portage Bay. Voyageurs' Wilderness Lodge  On Clearwater/Pipestone chain Big Eagle Lodge  On Eagle Lake. Can anyone give me information on these lodges? Will the fishing be any good the last week of June or the first week or 2 of July? Would late July be better? I appreciate any and all other suggestions that would fit into the above price range. Thank you.
