I've fished Ribes, Abbey and Anjigaming and have detailed trip reports with photos and videos for each if you'd like to take a look.Will be fishing Cam lake with Park's for the first time this season. Easy access to Little Missinaibi lake is the attraction there."
1525608,Phelpster,2013-01-18 16:57:00,5,Hello. I am new to this site but so far I am really enjoying what I see. I am looking for some advise on the best walleye/pike lakes within 3-4 hours of Sault Ste. Marie. I have heard many people talk about the Wawa area and Chapleau area. Also any advise on lodges/camps would also be appreciated. Not looking for anything fancy just a housekeeping plan. Not as concerned with huge trophies as we are about catching good numbers of fish. Never been to Canada fishing but have always wanted to do a trip and myself and 3 friends are planning to do one this spring/summer. Thanks for the help.

Very easy to get to and the fishing is good, plus you are also near White lake which is a large body of water. Not sure if they have house keeping. Fisherman 1792"
1525798,adempsey,2013-01-19 10:21:00,963,"There are plenty of places, so to narrow it down you should provide more details.Budget?Drive-in, boat-in or fly-in camp?Outpost or lodge?"
1525856,Phelpster,2013-01-19 14:03:00,5,OK. Did a little research and was looking for any feedback on the following 4 lodges:1. Happy Day Lodge2. Chapleau Lodge3. The Outpost Lodge4. Kanipahow Resort (any of their drive in outpost lakes)Looking to do a housekeeping plan. Any advise on how the fishing was at any of these lodges or any other input would be greatly appreciatedThank you.

1530339,[emailÂ protected],2013-01-29 11:18:00,21,"Reasonable cost fly-in fishing in the Chapleau Game Preserve...Check out Parks Fly-in Fishing. 2 people got to Ribes Lake. Ribes has a small older cabin and fantastic quantity and quality fishing for walleye and northern pike. If 4 people, go to Abbey Lake. Abbey is a longer lake and a little more effort to find the fish, but good walleye fishing. Suggest early July.[email protected]"
1530348,tooski,2013-01-29 11:28:00,393,"I second the Parks vote. Only difference is my group went to their Anjigaming post. Very good fishing, closer than Nakina area and very cost friendly. I may still have maps if Anji ends up your choice."
