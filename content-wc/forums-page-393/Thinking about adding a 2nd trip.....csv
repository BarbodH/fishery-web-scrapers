Looking into doing a couple day fly-in with the outfitter we used to go through before we changed to a drive-in trip. Taking my brothers 14 year old and my 8 year old. Any tips or tricks on taking an 8 year old? Keeping him interested etc. No electricity and all that. It's only a couple days so I think we will be fine, but just curious. I'm assuming people have had experience taking young kids on a fly-in.Thanks"

He never got board and was wore out by the end of the day. My son is 19 now and is going up with us this year for the first time in 5 years were both looking forward to it. Good luck and have fun.
