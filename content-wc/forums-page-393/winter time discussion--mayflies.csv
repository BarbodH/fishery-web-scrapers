1525860,v-bay gord,2013-01-19 14:13:00,3168,Just a long line trolling technique should do the job. You can give them the odd pull to change up the action and vary your trolling speed if necessary. I generally use light mono (ie 6 pound) with a small snap.....and let out quite a bit of line (too much is better than too little). Troll fairly slow and admire the scenery. Don't be afraid of mayflies. If all else fails find a thick patch of cabbage and rip some husky jerks through it (be sure and pause between twitches)....you'ld be surprised how many walleyes will lurk in those deeper cabbage patches.

1526035,jokerjim,2013-01-20 07:23:00,473,1/16 oz. jigs with a small yellow or brown mister twister. Slow fall through the may flys = lots of walleyes.
1526051,nitrodude,2013-01-20 07:58:00,60,"I keep a clear 2"" Adjust-A-Bubble bobber in my Canada bag to break out when the Mayflies are thick or the fishing hits a rare pause. I'll tie a Mayfly dry fly on 6lb. clear mono with the clear bobber half full of lake water about 2' above it and chuck it out in the productive areas that aren't cooperating. It has proven highly successful, but it is not very discriminating. Walleye, perch, smallmouth, etc. find it as attractive as the real deal most times and can turn a lag in the fishing back into a catch-a-thon."
1526181,adempsey,2013-01-20 12:44:00,963,"Last year the only difference I noticed was the ability to also catch some whitefish. Walleye fishing was good using standard jigging methods.I always have my ""Mayfly Backup Tackle"" just in case though. Some dry flies with a Bubble Float (like Nitrodude mentioed), some 1.5"" to 2"" brown grubs and some other bug/nymph type plastics (Powerbait Nymphs, Mister Twister Nymph). A small chunk of worm on a slip bobber is my first choice though. That usually works."
1527407,trapsht,2013-01-22 18:59:00,28,My trip last year was smack in the middle of a hatch. We had to fish real slow with a 1/3 of a crawler on a light jig and smoked them.
1527435,revitup,2013-01-22 19:47:00,140,thanks for all the replies guys. Trapsht--how light of a jig? 1/8? 1/16? Did color seem to matter at all?
1527999,btmbncr,2013-01-24 02:14:00,492,"I have done real well with a bouncer with a hook,colored bead and half a crawler over the mudflats the mayflies are hatching from.I have also kamakazied them on crankbaits pulled over the mudflats they're hatching on.Bigger fish on the crankbaits,you end triggering fish that are in a feeding mood as the crankbait comes by.I've also done well out in front of weedbeds fairly shallow with bouncers and a half crawler. Shadraps regular and the jointed in Perch,Baby Bass, Walleye,Hot Steel,Shad, Silver Shad and Silver.All these colors have worked good for me during the hatch.My theory is the bigger walleyes are also feeding on the smaller forage fish that are attracted to the hatching mayflies.That's why the crankbaits work.Seeing the spinners(?) on the water just changes my locations to find fish.Bill"

1508937,revitup,2012-12-01 04:30:00,140,"V-Bay is the thinking behind these two lures to fish them with pauses, to be keeping your lure in the same strike zone and that during the frenzy going on they will be striking anything that they come across?"

It has been my experience, though, that sometimes somewhat accurate reproductions are not as attractive to fish as sort-of facsimiles. Bill"
1509024,ILScott,2012-12-01 11:40:00,139,"During a mayfly hatch I like to troll with a bottom bouncer. Attached to the bottom bouncer a spinner rig that is 3 to 4 foot long with a gold hammered blade, aberdeen hook and a little piece of crawler. Troll the wind blown edge that has a ton of mayflies and I have had great success. I like the mayfly hatch personally that has been some of my best fishing but it was at the beginning of the hatch. Scott"
1509433,pikeman14,2012-12-02 19:35:00,144,"Great discussion!I once took a charter out on lake erie for walleyes. It was during the hatch, and the captain gave us all lindy rigs and night crawlers. We would cast out, let the bait sink and then slowly retrieve the rig. I noticed that the captain would locate the hatch on his depth finder, stop the boat and let us drift through it. We were all a bit embarrased bringing along a box of expensive lures, to only fish with night crawlers on a lindy."
1509468,revitup,2012-12-03 04:32:00,140,It seems one of the keys to success is to have some sort of lure that keeps suspended longer or a slower descent at least. Darker colors also seem to be a key to help imitate the hatch. Those northland jigs from wallydave appear to be 1/16th oz from the picture with a relatively big profile to keep them suspended longer. I'm wondering if a flyrod would be better with those just to give the ability to cast longer. anybody have any input on that? I feel my chances next summer are better than before--thanks guys for all the help.
1525835,revitup,2013-01-19 12:35:00,140,thought I would bump this to the front once to see if there are any more suggestions. Anybody willing to share the three things that are in their tackle box during a mayfly hatch and how they use them? Less than 5 months for my group on Cedar lake near Perrault Falls. I can't wait.
1508590,revitup,2012-11-30 05:51:00,140,"I have been a member of this forum for about 6 months and have found this to be an excellent site for information, learning and entertainment. I have looked through all history for mayfly threads and threads related to where I am scheduled to fish next summer(Cedar Lake near Perrault Falls). We are fishing there the 2nd week of June (8-15) where there is a reasonable chance of catching a mayfly hatch. To be honest the last time I dealt with the mayfly, I got kicked in the rear. I'm trying to avoid that this coming summer. So here's my question--What's in your tackle box for the mayfly? Also, what's in your mind as far as how to fish--ie. go to the mudflats and take the mayfly head on--or go deep and try to avoid or other thoughts. I'd like to go into this summer saying ""bring it on mayfly!"" and I can think of no better place than here to equip me with that attitude. Thanks everyone. Revitup--Joe Burns, central Illinois"
1508600,wallydave,2012-11-30 06:32:00,2151,Check out the Northland website! They have some mayfly jigs. I ordered some for my mid-June trip to Lac Seul. The hatch depends on the weather. The last two years have had a late and early ice-outs. Fishing is all about adapting to different conditions! Good luck!
1508610,v-bay gord,2012-11-30 07:02:00,3168,"Troll the mudflats. I've found Rapala Husky Jerks, or Tail Dancers to be very effective."
1508641,Bill Krejca,2012-11-30 08:47:00,6107,"As usual, we have to fish where the fish are. The hatches seem to draw many fish to soft bottoms, so advice given is good. It has been my experience that after getting where the fish are - whether in wind, rocks, or mud, the catching part becomes easier, no rocket science here. With hatches, the fish normally will hit other stuff if it looks like an easy meal to them. Slow retrieves with occasional stops sometimes helps. I have sat in the evening in the middle of gigantic hatches and taken many crappies by just wigging a minnow on the top of the water, creating ripples, even got one one time on a bare hook, also once took a bullhead on a dry fly, again in the evening, same situation. Sometimes in the evening, during a hatch, slowly retrieving/trolling a long Rapala on the surface, or alternating just below, will result in some nice walleyes. For a good book on understanding mayflies and their relatives, I suggest a book ""Nymphs"", by Ernest Schwiebert. This will keep one busy most of the winter. Bill Krejca"
1508650,Pikeslayer8,2012-11-30 09:12:00,1460,Nice thread Revitup. My preferred method is a black Road-Runner jig head with a black hellgrammite body. Hop it over mud flats. Killer.
1508738,Glenman12,2012-11-30 12:44:00,762,we fished Cedar last year during that same week..hit the mayfly hatch but the walleye fishing was some of the best..most fish were caught trolling wind swept points and shorelines..also rained a lot but not sure if that had anything to do with it..
1508748,JayM5209,2012-11-30 13:04:00,1050,"If you get a heavy hatch on Cedar, jump in your truck and run down the road a mile or two and see what's happening on Cliff. If the mayflies are hatching heavily on Cliff, drop a boat in at the launch site on 105 and have some fun with the lake trout. One of my best ever days of laker fishing - back 12 or 14 years ago - was on Cliff during a very hot, sunny day in early June. Mayflies covered the surface and the lakers where right under them slurping up their dinner. Long lining medium sized black/silver Rapala CDs got us a ton of trout.A great half-day or day long change of pace from chasing the 'eyes!"
1508756,dkrusin,2012-11-30 13:48:00,97,Wind blown shallow bays close to deep water. If you catch the hatch early it can be a feeding frenzy.
1508781,revitup,2012-11-30 15:02:00,140,"Thanks for the replies guys. Wallydave I looked at the Northland site and was wondering if there were jigs specifically stated to be mayfly jigs. I couldn't find any where I was looking and wondering if I am just missing it or if it takes a little more searching than I have done. next stop Rapala web site to look at those husky jerks and tail dancers.Another question--do you find fly rods to be effective or stick with regular spinning, spin cast and bait cast?"
