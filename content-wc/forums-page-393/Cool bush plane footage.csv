Some cool footage though. If you have never done a fly-in, I highly recommend one.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w2eexa2P6Yp.s. I was going to steal this and post as my own find..........but Hawkfan sent me the link. lol"

The video quality isn't great and I know I've probably posted it before but here is some footage from our 2008 trip.And, we DO tip. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLYYpbILr4c"

1529074,Golden Eagle,2013-01-26 08:58:00,2642,"It can be had for $199,000. Eager seller. Might take less. Maybe a lot less."
1529216,Skywagon,2013-01-26 15:49:00,1106,"Connie, last I heard he had it listed for $225, cold weather special now I guess. It is beautiful plane, would look good in front of your garage."
1529225,Golden Eagle,2013-01-26 16:02:00,2642,My wife won't even let me have an F Farmall. Would look great in my front yard and I could use it for about 20 minutes every year to plow my 40' x 45' vegetable garden.
