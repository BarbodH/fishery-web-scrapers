But I found no info about where to buy good large live minnows. I am headed there the first week of June, am a first timer to Minaki, an excellent jig fisherman from Manitoba, 50 years old...any walleye tips on spinner colors, jig colors, artificials or anything else you experts figure a guy should know going in would be very much greatly appreciated."

If you haven't fished the system before, you'll quickly discover that you can fish as little current or as much current as you're comfortable with. When I'm talking heavy current, I'm talking about stuff that requires amazingly heavy bouncers or pencil weights, not your standard 1-3 ouncers. Minaki is so cool because you can either fish portions which would be classified as river fishing, classic shield lake areas or in between. I haven't fished Minaki in early June but I would be checking out some of the bays with emergent vegetation at that time of year. Depending on the spring we have, you could check some of the shallower reefs as well. I'm always a fan of crawlers at that time of year once the water starts to warm up. Don't hesitate to fish some jerkbaits (Husky Jerks, X-Raps, etc) adjacent to weedbeds or around some windswept areas. Colour doesn't seem to make a huge difference there."
