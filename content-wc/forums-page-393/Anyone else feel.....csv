Normally only get it out for a few minutes during shore lunch. I'm amazed at all the quality fish i've caught doing it considering the lack of time put in. Biggest being 24""Anyone else like to bobber fish for eyes?"
1529634,wallydave,2013-01-27 18:20:00,2151,I have seen guys fishing bobbers and suckers for pike. I'm going to try some Northlands mayfly jigs and a slip Bonner near the docks and on the flats in mid June on Lac Seul.
1529664,campchick,2013-01-27 19:19:00,96,Yup! Love to use a bobber in the current. Have you ever used one that lights up?
1529670,Ranger319,2013-01-27 19:27:00,166,"Not up in Canada but 5 of us one night were out catfishing, each one had 2 lighted bobbers in a variety of colors. Looked like a Christmas tree on the water!"
1529711,Knoxabilly,2013-01-27 21:42:00,225,"This is a regular thing for us on Lac Seul- have caught a 28"" eye doing this. Sometimes it's the most productive technique. My Uncle caught a 41"" Northern on a bobber in 96'!"
1530076,jaym,2013-01-28 17:53:00,89,"After a full day of trolling and drifting we have a spot where we anchor up and bobber fish after dinner. We use leeches and on many occasions, as soon as the bobber stands up it goes under. It's a great way to end the day and we have caught walleyes up to 28"". Last year we watched a caribou on the shoreline and have seen moose and bears swimming across the lake while we sat there."
