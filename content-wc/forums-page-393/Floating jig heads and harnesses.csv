1528001,btmbncr,2013-01-24 02:42:00,492,"Bigger walleyes are usually just below the depth their prey is holding at.Ive seen them suspended in trees,hanging just under schools of baitfish,laying on the bottom.When fishing them suspended I run my cranks about a foot above them.I have caught a lot of walleyes running crankbaits at least 2 feet off the bottom.To say big walleyes are always 3 feet of the bottom just isn't so.I don't scuba dive anymore,too old and crippled up.I've seen some really big walleyes belly to the bottom in Mille Lacs,Ft Peck and Sakakawea.My brother in law dives Lake Oahe all summer long.He talks about seeing walleyes,close to the bottom,suspended etc it just depends on the day.Bill"
1529047,GreatWhiteNorth517,2013-01-26 07:58:00,286,"Last year I fished the same lake, same GPS path across the same structure. Same time of day, identical stable weather pattern both days. Day 1 was slow trolling a slow death Lindy rig @ 0.6-0.7 mph. Day 2 was trolling a flicker shad on leadcore at 1.6-1.8 mph. Day 2 produced four times as many fish as day 1.Did they like the crankbait better than the crawler? Did they like the increased speed? Were the fish suspended instead of just off the bottom? Did it help to not be banging lead on the bottom? YES"
1529548,Jigger1,2013-01-27 14:33:00,234,"I think the issue is active, neutral or inactive rather than bigger fish being a particular amount of feet above the bottom. My largest walleye ever came off a bottom bouncer in 30 feet of water, my second largest in 8 feet of water on a jig right at bottom. Last year my largest walleye, a 28, came off a bottom bouncer. My three 27's all came from jig and minnow fished right at bottom. Bar none my most productive days on the water have been when we are moving fast and covering water searching for active fish, but conditions dictate when this kind of fishing will work. I guess I'm a little old school as I still prefer and have such an incredibly high confidence level in bottom bouncing, while the other folks in my boat have concentrated on rip jigging also with great success. I wouldn't hesitate to jump to rip jigging if the bouncer wasn't producing, but thus far that seldom has that been the case. And I think it's such a blast when we are using different techniques and all catching fish. Mike Willems recently published an article on his website that hits on this topic from multiple angles. http://www.sww-lodge.com/2013/01/hi-...ower-plastics/"
1525955,55walleyes,2013-01-19 20:04:00,131,I recently read in an article an observation made by a scuba diver. He stated that most of the bigger walleye were at least three feet off the bottom. In my recent experiences up north it does seem to me that I catch bigger walleye on the floating rigs but more numbers jigging the bottom.Any body have any thoughts on this?
1525959,seanndenise,2013-01-19 20:17:00,161,"I've never had any luck with a floating jig head, haven't used one since the early 80s.I can picture what my jig is doing in my head down on the bottom and a floating jig head would foul that all up.Just seems like they would take away all your control."
1526009,zeebee,2013-01-20 05:21:00,1144,"Little bit of a generalization but odds are stacked in his favour. The biggest are where you find them. My son caught a 32"" on the bottom....I caught my PB while trolling. What conclusion are you gonna draw?"
1526058,bigdaddyguns,2013-01-20 08:24:00,608,Will you post the title and author of the scuba article? Is it available on line? Thanks.
1526071,55walleyes,2013-01-20 08:56:00,131,I have no idea on magazine title or author. It was in a magazine someone had left at an outpost.When I use a floating jig head I will put some type of twister tail on and drag it slowly more so than jig it. Some days a small piece if nightcrawler on a floating jig head is best.
1526387,bigdaddyguns,2013-01-20 22:49:00,608,I use floating jigheads when fishing over areas that contain sandgrass. The floater keeps the leech/crawler above that grass on the bottom making the presentation less susceptible to weed accumulation. I can't say I noticed a larger catch pattern on floating versus sinking
1526396,46Harley,2013-01-20 23:25:00,149,I also have read articles that say the most active biters are up a foot or two above the bottom. I have used floating jigs with Lindy Rigs and have had good success. Don't remember catching anything exceptionally large however.
1526444,Bill Krejca,2013-01-21 06:29:00,6107,"Not being a scuba diver, I haven't had the opportunity to observe from that vantage point. My thought is that where the fish are depends on a number of factors, the bottom structure being one. Also, whether the fish are in a hide mode or roaming. Current would also play a role, also, whether the fish is fed up, or hungry, etc. Also, whether and where a school of lunch is cruising by. Bottom bouncers are not always (in my case seldom) dragged across the bottom, but pulled somewhat above the bottom, the actual bait being somewhat above the bottom of the bottom bouncer. I'm not sure where I'm going with this, other than to point out there are many factors involved. I like floating heads ( Phelps) where the bottom is strewn with brush, as I get less snags and feel the bait can still be in the catch zone. Bill Krejca"
1526467,ftfarms,2013-01-21 07:37:00,444,I fish in Canada a lot and there's not a day that I don't use one. We use phelps floaters. I've trolled them cast and retrieved them and my favorite cast and let them sit awhile. I've caught some nice walleyes by letting it sit kinda like cat fishing. I start in the sping with 18-24 inch after the weight and times in the summer I've went as long as 48-54 inches. I can't count as many times I've been up there fishing and most every one incamp is bring in a few little ones or saying there not biting while we've landed 25-30 nice fish in the morning and more than that late afternoon. Walleyes definitely sit off the bottom early summer all though the summer
1526513,Mudpuippy,2013-01-21 09:15:00,23,"My experience is all positive with floating jigs. For our group they just up our catch percentage by a factor of two. Most years in camp we catch more and bigger walleyes on floaters than the rest of the camp. Work especially well in weeds early in the season, and even more deadly on 14 to 18 ft. bars later. Your milage may vary.Mudpuppy"
