From what I understand, Little Miss is the most popular lake that Hawk Air fly's to. Unless you get some other advise, I would pick Little Miss if you can get a week on the lake. It may be booked up."

Larger than average size just not as many during the day. 27 inch walleye was the top fish last trip. Also numerous northerns. We liked Upper Duffy but we loved Duffy. Unbelievable fishing 2 or our 3 trips (late june) 31 inch walleye was top fish 1 year, 34 inch monster topped another. If you can get into Duffy or Miss--do it. Hawk Air is a great outfit to deal with. They have always gone out of their way to satisfy our needs. I've flown with them 9 times. 6 walleye trips and 3 Brookie trips to Chadwicks Kwagama Lake Lodge."
