Go to my ""Profile Page/John L. Hecklsmiller"" #2. Click on the Social Club: ""Fans of LOTW-USA & Canada"" #3. Click on the ""Last Reply"" & it will take you to my last 2 reports. #4. I was also able to learn how to post some LOTW pics in my album, which is accessible to the public. Member of the site: ""clm112864"" posted some pics mid Dec. of 2012 that inspired me to try reporting to the club after I was pretty discouraged from 3 previous attempts. The forum only allows 1000 characters for a posting now, where prior to 2012 it was unlimited. Set the Hook, CRJohn"

Nice walleye numbers and good size at times. We had much better luck last year on yellow perch. We able to find and reel in the jumbos! Northern fishing seemed to be a little off, partly because we spend more and more time each year for walleye. Good luck in 2013"
