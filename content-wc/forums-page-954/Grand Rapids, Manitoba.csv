520974,Mike in MN,2002-06-01 14:44:00,9,"I will be driving up to Cedar Lake (near Grand Rapids MB) to fish for walleye and northern pike this July. I would like to obtain a map of this lake. I have tried several sources including Canada Map Sales, and have come up empty. Also, I would like to take a day to fish lake trout in this area, but don't know which lake to try. Any suggestions on either would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Mike"
