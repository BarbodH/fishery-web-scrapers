520464,Xplorer,2002-05-20 14:37:00,244,"Hey Mark, How far is your cabin from the Bears Pass area? I have fished Swell and the south part of Redgut in years past with a friend who has a family cabin on an island near there,but am thinking of taking the family for a week. Have stayed at the Fisheries campground a couple of times also. Might be interested later this summer (baby due in June) or next year. Also if you want to e-mail me info/rates I'd appreciate it.Thanks, Chris [email protected]"
