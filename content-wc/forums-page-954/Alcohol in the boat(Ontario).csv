As extra insurance, keep the booze as far from you in the boat as possible. There is a rule about proximity to the operator for cars, but I'm not sure if it applies to boats. I can find no mention of that on the Coast Guard site."

In that area they totally understand the need to transport goods via boat. HOWEVER, having a cold beverage in ones hands & missing a container in the proper case may get their attention......I really wouldn't worry about it.Good FishenRob"
