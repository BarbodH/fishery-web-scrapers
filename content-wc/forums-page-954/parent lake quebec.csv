520893,Seanik,2002-05-30 07:48:00,218,"I will be going to Berthelot Lake June 28 which is 68 miles east of Parent Lake. I talked to the Lodge 5 day ago and they said the weather was very cold, ice would reform at night and the bite was slow. THe present warmer weather should improve everything. We will be crossing into Canada at the 1000 islands bridge, am wondering about delays there? Also what is the best route around Ottawa? Sorry about asking questions off your post but I have not been to Quebec in many years.Thanks"

Drive through shawville to kazabazua then north. there is also a ferry at quyon that crosses the river but there is the possibility of a delay waiting for it. It is about 7 or 8 dollars to cross on the boathope this helpsjale6666
