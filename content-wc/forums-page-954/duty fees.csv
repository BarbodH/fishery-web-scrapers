520753,fishinnut,2002-05-28 06:48:00,642,Last time I paid a duty on extra beer I think it was $7.00 - $9.00 a case. You probably are better off buying Canadian.
520754,Guest,2002-05-28 06:49:00,0,"It's $9 a case, and be prepared to be searched. The beer in Canada costs more but is also much stronger."

520756,Guest,2002-05-31 06:20:00,0,the duty is based on what you paid for the beer - not a flat rate. buy it at you favorite beer store and take the receipt along.
