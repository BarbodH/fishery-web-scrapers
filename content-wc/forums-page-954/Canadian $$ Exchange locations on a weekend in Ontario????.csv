Some banks are open in Thunder Bay on Saturday, TD Canada Trust on the corner of Harbour Expressway and Memorial Ave and also right across the street there is a CIBC bank that is also open on Saturdays.Good Luck Fishing!"

The camp where we stay seems to be very close. Maybe I am loosing more than I think, but my time on Saturday going and returning is at a premium.Enjoy your trip - I am going this Saturday! Can't wait."
