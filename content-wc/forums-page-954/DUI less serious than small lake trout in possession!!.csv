520915,Guest,2002-05-30 15:40:00,0,"uh i think ddr was being sarcastic....the point as i see it is: the disparity in fees/fines. $420.00 + $200.00 for a careless or honest mistake as opposed to 200.00 for what amounts to an opportunistic money grab. several posters about this issue have pointed out the ease with which records can be checked, and as far a ""registering"" as you call it i would call it data entry, at $100.00 an hour a person could spend 2 hours entering data and still break even. i doubt the customs and immigration officers make anywhere near even $50.00 per hour."
