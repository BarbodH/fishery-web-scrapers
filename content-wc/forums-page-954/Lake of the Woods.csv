520851,GLO,2002-05-29 17:14:00,318,"Just back from Wiley Point Lodge - NW peninsula. You should have great weather and great fishing. Ours was marginal, mostly cold but water was getting warmer the whole weekend. Fishing was very spotty, fished from Wiley area east and south within 25 minute radius. Caught a lot of perch and walleye. Walleyes mostly 14"" to 19"" range. Did not really get into the bunches of 22""-24"" like last year it seemed many would get into. Three in the group caught 7 pounders."
