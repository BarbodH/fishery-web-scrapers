The last time we were there, we were later in June and the weeds were starting to develop. We would troll along the shoreline for walleye, and when we would come to some weeds (cabbage) we would cast for northerns. There is a bay to the back of the larger area that had a lot of shallows with a stream coming in that we caught a bunch of northerns with silver minnows before we got chased out by a storm that came in. Not much for topography, but we've caught good numbers of walleye and northerns just trolling and casting along the shoreline It's a neat area and worth the trip down there. If you come over from Sawmill, be careful of the rocks - just take it slow."

Always amazed when you're going over some of the wider and deeper spots on the lake, then out of nowhere you see a rock off to the side of the boat....just makes my prop cringe thinking about it. Just think....9 days away until we're fishing up there!!!"

520380,lunker99,2002-05-22 20:54:00,236,We're also headed up the 7th of june. Where are you staying? We will be at golden fawn just outside of ear falls.
520381,Big Tim,2002-05-23 03:27:00,63,I'm headed to lac seul TOMORROW! Be back on June 2. Will give you guys heads up on Ear Falls area. Watch for my post.
520382,lunker99,2002-05-23 07:03:00,236,"Great, can't wait to hear! Dad called up to our camp last night. They said lake is ice -free, but they were forcasting for 1 1/2 inches of snow for last night also. Also said fishing is a little slower than normal, but the ones that they are catching are nice ones. Good luck!"
520383,Guest,2002-05-25 09:11:00,0,We're also going to Golden Fawn on the 7th of June. I just started to look for weather reports and also how the fishing has been - any news that you can share?Ken
520384,lunker99,2002-05-25 16:23:00,236,"Last I heard was what I said in previous post. A new post today from someone fishing n.e. lac suel confirmed what I heard....not catching numbers, just size, which is fine by me. What cabin you staying in so I can say eh on the way by?"
520385,Guest,2002-05-26 19:35:00,0,"We're in cabin 3 this year as in years past. I got a report from someone that went up this last week and took a canoe trip into southern Ontario on a tent trip. They had frost most mornings, and it was cold fishing, but they caught walleye up to 7# and also some northern of decent size. Where do you guys fish on Lac Seul? Mostly we go to Sawmill as do most of the people this time of year. I'd be interested to hear where you go and what seems to work for you. Stop by cabin 3 and have a cold one with us.Ken"
520386,lunker99,2002-05-27 06:49:00,236,"We catch most of our big fish in sawmill also. There are several points back in there that we do well at. We also fish the mouth at the sanctuary, winnesagua falls, and down at the river dams as a change in pace. Have always thought about going down to the steamboat narrows area and trying it, but haven't yet. Maybe this will be the year. We usually anchor and pitch jigs or slip bobbers when we are fishing up there. Will definitely stop in and see how you are doing this week. Don't know if you remeber or not, but my wife and I were the one's up there with the little baby girl last year...and yes she's coming again this year. Nothing like starting them young!"
