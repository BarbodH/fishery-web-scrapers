520643,Guest,2002-05-31 06:07:00,0,"Say, why don't you guys stick to the topic? Many of us out here would like to hear about the condition of highway 502 before heading north. We DON'T want to hear all your little cutesy comments to one another. Do this on a different forum, like e-mail one another. The rest of us are not interested in your on going chatter to one another about your inside adventures. STICK TO THE TOPIC!"
520644,Big Tim,2002-06-02 07:37:00,63,"Went up 502 Sat.,25th, came back Sat., 1st. No delays on north trip (Too early? 8 AM) 3 stops of less than 5 min.ea. on return. 105 is GREAT all the way to Ear Falls."
520633,Guest,2002-05-25 05:42:00,0,"Are they working on Hwy 502 yet this year? If so, how are the delays?"
520634,Wisconeye,2002-05-25 06:16:00,79,Gary:There was a post earlier about 502 and the construction you might want to search for. Here is the link https://www.walleyecentral.com/dcf/canada/2804.htmlIs that old man UMP going along?If so I can understand why you wouldn't want to encounter any delays!!!!
520635,Guest,2002-05-25 08:13:00,0,Thanks for the info...and yes Ump is headed up but he's going a week earlier. I figure he should be just about there by the time we get there. Said he would leave a few for me and the family. Thanks again.
520636,Guest,2002-05-25 13:20:00,0,"Just got back, 502 had a few places that they were work on. But no asphalt construction, they were working on the ditches and puting up posts along the road. Mo delays at all"
520637,Guest,2002-05-27 18:19:00,0,"poor gary ,it will take a extra day to get to merkles this year . i have been the path finder for years and it will be the gary first time out of the state by him self. one year he got torn down at the border for to much beer . i hope he finds his way home without his path finder . ( poor umpie)"
520638,Wisconeye,2002-05-27 20:22:00,79,Poor Gary? He finally got sense enough to go AFTER ol Umpie got done churning up the water. He'll probably be able to get back and forth without tearing up a lower unit. He will miss the fun of watching his fishing partner loose his sunglasses over board or other famous shenanigans that go on with the ol BULLHEAD KING himself.I heard he got tore down because someone was bragging about all the beer he was carrying over the walkie talkies between trucks!!!!!Good Luck Umpie!! While you're there I'll be making sure the juice is flowing here at home- now you should know!!!!Wisconeye
520639,Guest,2002-05-28 17:48:00,0,"poor peck . the first year the path finder took him ,he woke up one night and he here a bear out side of the cabin clawing the sideing and the great umpie had to go out side and chase the bear away . this poor guy can't cook either so he is taking his wife . if anyone see 6 foot 4 in guy wondering lost please help him . (poor umpie)"
520640,fishmaster,2002-05-29 16:25:00,209,Looks like they might be starting to do something soon.Boy they need the work!!!!!!Took a stone off the winsheild for the 3rd time in 4 years and for the 5th time in 20 trips.just watch out for those guys that hug the shoulder.Good luck and watch out for the moose and bear seen more this year(bear) than ever before probably cause of them ending the spring hunt a few years ago.fishmaster
520641,Guest,2002-05-30 18:54:00,0,"Say you wouldn't be the same Peckham that used to go fishing with a guy named Dumpie or Gumpie. I met this guy at Genoa, WI. and he was talking about his Canadien experiences and I think your name came up. He claimed he could out fish, out drink, out fart, and out Luther you any time. Course I think this guy was a little full of it."
520642,Guest,2002-05-30 19:43:00,0,"are you that guy that at genoa that went home that night with that ugly woman that had no front teeth ? poor old peck , there will be no fishing like the good old days this year . if you didnt get so wet ,going to your honey holes in the boat you could stay longer and fish longer . by the way you only fart like mouse this year since your wife and kids will be there . good luck , but i am leaving sat . ( poor umpie )"
