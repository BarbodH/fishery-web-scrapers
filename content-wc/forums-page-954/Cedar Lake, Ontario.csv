520727,Mckoz,2002-05-27 11:38:00,239,I am heading up mid June with a bunch of Musky fanatics - I know nothing about this lake but was hoping I could do some walleye fishing - anybody know much about this lake?Thanks

The fish were real sluggish and pretty small...It was not like St. Joe or Lac Seul, that much I am sure of...the lake was nice and I could see it being a decent Musky lake...there was one small lake that you could dump into right near there (less than 2 miles) that was supposed to be a great northern/musky lake...Hopefully you have better luck than us...we did have a cold front move through so I will cut the lake a little slack, but I have to admit I was not too impressed overall. Good luck and prove me wrong.Shuffler's Kid"

My advise to you would be to head to the SE bays especially Redwater Bay and the bay where the spawning area is. Your lodge operator should be able to tell you where this is. Most of the walleyes spawn will probably still be near the spawning areas since the spring has been so cold. The bays in this area are also stained and they heat up faster. In Redwater bay, go to the far end around by the islands and just drift or backtroll with 1/8 or 1/4 oz. jigs with minnows, crawlers or leeches. Also pay attention to the wind and fish points and or weeds where the wind is blowing into. Four o'clock bay is closer to many of the lodges and has been productive in the past but the dark water bays to the southeast have always been productive."
