I would like to obtain the services of a guide for Pike fishing while I'm on Lac Seul the first week of July. Can any of you provide me with information to find a guide that would teach me what to look for when hunting trophy pike. I'm not expecting loads of fish, just the opportunity to hunt a trophy, and to learn.What is considered a trophy pike?"
