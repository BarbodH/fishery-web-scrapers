We will be there the third week in June.If we get a chance we would like to try to catch one of these prehistoric critters- but don't know the first thing about it?Does anyone have any tips? I have never even seen a Lake Sturgeon but have had some people tell me to keep one and try eating it? Now, I'm assuming they didn't mean raw so how should a person prepare one? Probably let any go that we catch but I wouldn't mind trying one if I was sure how to cook it.Any ideas would be appreciated!!GOOD FISHING!!!"

Go with about 20lb test, Slip on a large sinker (size depends on current), large barrel swivel about 15"" of line then a wide gap hook such as the Eagle Kahle style. Slide on a few large crawlers to make a ball. Ensure the the sinker keeps on the bottom, I find barrel sinkers seem to work the best in current.Remember if the reservoir your heading to is in Manitoba sturgeon are strictly catch and release."
