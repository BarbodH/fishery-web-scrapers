6288304,JAY221,2019-02-10 15:15:00,877,"just a bit of advice buti would be spending some time looking hard @ getting a place lined up as you are running out of time for this year. Later, Jay"
6288416,camp chef,2019-02-11 06:54:00,915,Big North Lodge in Minaki. Check out there website and Facebook page. We are going back for our sixth trip.
6288430,rockape,2019-02-11 07:27:00,215,"You totally need to book at Abram Lake Camp. 4 hours from I Falls, and killer walleye fishing. You are close to town too. They have a beach, playground, RV and Camping, awesome cabins, protected dock too. You will have to cook your own meals. Huge pike and walleye are all around you. PM me if you want more info."
6288528,x4flatfish,2019-02-11 10:26:00,319,"x2...Stayed there about 15 years ago. Cabins were new then. They were first rate. Haven't been there since, but have fished that area for 50 years. You would not be disappointed. BTW You are looking at peak time and your chances of getting in anywhere are decreasing by the day..."
6288578,wallydave,2019-02-11 12:22:00,2151,"Take a look st Goose Bay Camp, nice docks and space for RV's., they are close to town if some shopping is needed."
6288770,prov1900,2019-02-11 22:32:00,544,Goose Bay is a great camp. I know the week before it appeared that they had little left in the way of cabins. I would contact Andrea ASAP. Good Luck and hope you get in!
6288836,Aspencreek,2019-02-12 07:52:00,2911,"Goose Bay is a good suggestion, another may be Scout Bay Camp on LS. Correct me if I am wrong but I thought Scout Bay had just changed ownership (am I correct) and they may have a cabin open that time , worth the phone call. BUT, you are discovering that good camps fill FAST, and that you need to be making plans and reservations a year in advance and even then you may not be able to get in. Most camps will only start to take reservations for the following year after their guests this year have decided to book again or not, leaving the cabin open for next year."
6288892,emma17,2019-02-12 09:06:00,436,X 3. We brought an RV there about 5 years ago. Camping was great- we did not stay in cabins. The location gets you on Minnitaki as well as Abram. Easy drive to LS too. We loved fishing Minnitaki.
6289918,RESJR,2019-02-14 17:14:00,7,I second the recommendation for Stanley's on Eagle Lake. A very family friendly place. Looks like they have openings for your preferred week.
6288078,Bergy,2019-02-09 20:40:00,83,"I have written on here quite a few times and gotten some great suggestions for camp to stay at. It seems every time I find something suitable, the camp is booked. Any other suggestions for a good camp with 5+/- hours of International Falls that has great Walleye fishing and good clean cabins for a family (wife and daughter)Thanks"
6288092,outdoorsron,2019-02-09 22:09:00,843,"Hello Bergy: to help you find what you want we need a little more information. Do you want an american plan , how remote , bringing your own boat ? How long of a stay, a big lake or a smaller one ? The more information you can give the better. Good Luck. O - R"
6288096,Golden Eagle,2019-02-09 22:50:00,2642,I know of a couple of openings at a good camp with lots of walleyes and big pike. What weeks are you considering?
6288120,jtwater58,2019-02-10 06:32:00,5,Look at Stormer Lake Lodge outside of Red Lake. Great owners in Dave and Linda. They might be full depending on your week. They have great repeat guest bookings. PM if you want more info.

6288172,Duflebag,2019-02-10 08:56:00,218,"Bergy, I have posted this reply to others looking for a camp that focuses on families rather than fishermen. I would highly recommend Stanley's West Arm Resort on Eagle Lake. I have known the owners for over 25 years. The resort was owned by Marv Wisniewski for years and has been run by his son Rob and Rob's wife Chantel for quite a while now. Stanley's is one of the only family resorts that I know. There are a lot of things to do for the whole family. I have recommended Stanely's to many friends that wanted to bring their family up to Canada and not have the rest of the family not happy because you are in a strictly fishing camp. I am not related in any way to Stanley's other than being friends with the family for going on 30 years now. I go to another camp for my fishing trips but I recommend Stanley's for anyone looking for a family oriented family resort. I hope your family has the trip of a lifetime."
6288176,NARDA 1,2019-02-10 09:02:00,636,When are you planning to take your trip?
6288194,Bergy,2019-02-10 09:59:00,83,We would like the week of June 22 - 29. We want a drive to camp. We would be bringing our own boat and want a resort with protected docks. Targeting Walleye with other species a bonus. Would like a spot for the family to swim and the place to have other activities. I want to make sure the cabins are kept up and are clean. A bonus would be if the camp had RV camping. My sister and her family might want to join ya with there RV. Thanks for the suggestions in advance. Thanks for the suggestions.
6288230,NARDA 1,2019-02-10 12:08:00,636,Just sent you a PM.
