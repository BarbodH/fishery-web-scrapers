6296726,wmd,2019-03-07 12:11:00,388,"I have fished in September on several different lakes in Ontario. I agree with everything BTF posted and believe the key is humps with access to deep water. The deep water is relative to the body of water you are on, it may be 15-25 feet deep or may be 25-40 feet deep. When they are on rock humps they are there for one reason and that is to feed. September is my favorite month to fish in Canada. wmd"
6296776,stjoeguy,2019-03-07 14:13:00,979,"Bill, I'm glad to hear September is your favorite month. As you know, I've fished St. Joe in June for gazillion years and the fishing has been great. For the last five years I've fished other Ontario lakes is September, also. It's always been fun but the fishing has never compared to June. I've attributed that to being a different lake (it's not St. Joe is my constant mantra), which means more time exploring and a different time of year, which means trying to get out of June habits and learn September habits. This September I'm going back to St. Joe so that eliminates one of my excuses as I'll know the lake. When we're fishing St. Joe together this June I'd appreciate some tips from you on where you'd look in September. Thanks. Paul"
6296840,prov1800,2019-03-07 16:20:00,5010,Hope you don't plan to fish 40 ft.all you'll end up doing is killing a bunch of fish and undoing all the conservation efforts everybody else is doing.
6297196,wmd,2019-03-08 12:23:00,388,"Nope was saying deep water maybe 40 feet in one lake and 25 in another, not planning on fishing that deep."
6297292,BornToFish,2019-03-08 15:34:00,1224,"Greetings, I fished many Septembers on a lake that had 40-60 fow in the main lake basin. I would be in for a very long day of fishing in September should I fish a hump that topped out around 15 fow, and is surrounded by 20-25 fow. My best September fishing was on humps that topped out around 15-20 fow that were surrounded by 40+ fow. I might have been catching my fish on side of the hump in 24 fow, but what made the spot great was that it was a short cast to 40+ fow. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6296168,Mojo-NC,2019-03-06 11:01:00,1929,"Ok, we're still 183 days out but that doesn't mean I'm not thinking about our upcoming fly-in to NW Ontario. We've always fished late May - Early June and never early-mid September. Other than the obvious, what are some of the major differences between fishing those different time periods? I assume the fish are still deepish, but beginning to move back shallow to feed. The weeds should be fully developed but beginning to fade. The water temps should be beginning to drop from the August highs. The fish should be eating larger baits to fatten up for winter. There will be a later sunrise and earlier sunset, considerably shortening our daylight hours. Other than that, will the fishing patterns be dramatically different? Can I make the assumption that the larger profile baits will be preferred as opposed to lower profile baits that we generally use in the spring? Are a lot of the walleyes and pike still suspended in deep water? Please share your thoughts and experiences. Thanks in advance."
6296326,BornToFish,2019-03-06 13:46:00,1224,"Greetings,September is my FAVORITE month to fish in NW Ontario. The thing that I like most about walleye fishing in September is that if I can find one fish, I then know where they all are. It's the month that I normally put up my best numbers and size of fish.An interesting thing about September is that it's a time of considerable change in weather patterns. You might encounter the best and worst weather of the entire season, both in the same day. Wind is normally more of a factor in September, as compared to July and August. Plan to dress in layers and take along all of your rain gear, gloves, hats and warm boots. As you pointed out, weeds are normally in rapid decline, such that many fish are moving into ever smaller patches of green weeds. As the weeds fade, if you can find three strands or green cabbage in fairly close proximity, you better cast it. The big predators lurk around these remaining green weeds as they hold lots of bait fish. Eventually, the fish are forced to move out of the weeds. They often then linger around the first break or nearby structural elements.Most of my walleye fishing in September is associated with off-shore rock humps. I also bias towards rock humps that have quick access to deep water. I fished one lake where I normally fished walleyes in 28-35 fow during September. I now fish a lake where I fish shallower during September - say 20-30 fow. Again, I look for spots associated with quick access to deep water. My presentations are vertical during September. Boat control becomes very important at this time of the year.I've noticed over the years that the walleye bite normally collapses to minnows in the autumn. It's difficult to find leeches - period! Night crawlers will still work, but (for me at least) not as well as minnows.The water temperature is normally falling quickly in September. Thus, SLOW presentations are the norm for me. If you happen to be there 7-10 days before turnover, the pike and musky bite can be PHENOMENAL. I look for them during this window during the afternoons. I target shallow weeds (3-6 fow) in bays receiving wind - the warmest water available in the lake.If you find yourself sliding into May fishing patterns, you may find that your fishing will not go well. If it's not working, change up what you are doing.You will notice that bugs are normally not a factor in September. You will likely notice much less boat traffic on the lakes as well.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6296348,Mojo-NC,2019-03-06 14:35:00,1929,"BTF, thanks for the information and advice regarding your past experiences. I sure hope the fish are not in 30' of water as I have fished that deep but don't really like to unless it is a necessity. We primarily fish for walleye but like to occasionally fish for pike, especially if we discover that a bite is on. We won't have to worry about boat traffic as we'll have the entire lake to ourselves (4 guys, 2 boats). We're the last group of the season and they're even letting us stay a few extra days. I've been trying to get the lodge to put us in contact with a recent guest so we can ask some questions about logistics, etc. since it's our first fly-in, but no luck so far. Maybe they will wait until groups begin to come up this year. I'd love to hear about other's experiences fishing September as well."
6296472,hoppy63,2019-03-06 20:29:00,367,Where are you heading?
6296476,hoppy63,2019-03-06 20:45:00,367,"I am an expert by no means. Have 6-7 Canadian trips in so far. I love September as the temps cooling off, look forward to that nice fire to warm cabin, and as was stated bugs are basically non exists compared to june. I will say our latest trip in September was our least productive. It was a lake with quite a bit of deep water....up to 100'. I do not know much about the ""turn over"" except what I have read on here but I believe we hit it at that time. We fished these waters several years past and catching 30-50 fish per man was not all that hard, and i don't fish all that hard all day. That is my only concern fishing later in the year. I believe that was the third week in September. We still caught fish, but it was not easy. Now we almost strictly jig. We usually take crawlers but use a lot of gulp minnows and leeches. Good luck on your trip."
6296492,martinbns,2019-03-06 21:36:00,1520,"Last June was great, but September was terrible. The bite for walleye just stopped around Sept 15th."
6296554,BornToFish,2019-03-07 06:34:00,1224,"Greetings,I do not fish for walleyes any deeper than I have to in order to catch fish. I fish for them wherever they are, as I won't get bit if I am fishing where they are not.Water temperatures often peak out on many lakes in NW Ontario during mid to late August. This will push many walleyes deeper as they search out cooler water temperatures that are within their comfort zone. Water temperatures typically change quite fast in the middle of September. At some point, I believe the walleyes become annoyed with the unstable water temperatures in shallow or surface water. Thus, they often move slightly deeper than they were in August in search of stability in water temperature. Experience has shown me that they may not move far from where they were in August, just deeper on the same structure. This is a big part of why I search out off-shore rock humps with quick access to deep water (i.e. 25 - 40 fow). Thus, you might want to ask anglers that you contact where they fished during August, as the walleyes will likely be in that vicinity.My fishing in August/September is very different than the places/techniques that I use in May/June. It's not that one time of the year is better or worse, but rather different due to the seasonal movements of the fish.I'm confident that you will do very well if you adapt to the conditions that you encounter.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6296572,Mojo-NC,2019-03-07 07:02:00,1929,We'll be fishing September 7th - 16th on a fairly small lake that has some very deep water in the middle (95'). I'm sure we'll be able to find some fish. Either that or we'll be spending a lot of time looking for them. I already have my tackle box packed and ready to go.
6296648,GWC,2019-03-07 08:58:00,1021,"I've fished Gull Rock Lake in September, normally the third week. We trolled hot-n-tots & bandit 300's. It's pretty cool & normally windy but we did very well. The big pike were coming on strong & we caught plenty of walleye. Most mornings the docks had frost until about 9 am & we came in about 4 PM. That's about the last week before the camps close. There is less of a crowd on the water this time of the year & that's nice too."
6296680,labsrus,2019-03-07 10:40:00,557,We like to go up in mid September Fishing seems to be better than earlier in the year. Bugs are a big factor as I hate black flies in June. Our experience is that the fish seem to be easier to find and catch with shallow patterns being the norm Weather can also turn quick so plan to bring some warm clothes and a good rain suit that could double as a wind break
