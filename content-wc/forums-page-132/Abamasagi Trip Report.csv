4931929,gmattbruin,2016-06-16 10:22:00,174,"Our turn at #3 Abamasagi on saturday.....its been 2yrs for our group. The last one ended abruptly on the fri morning with an accident involving our father. Hes in his 70s, tough as nails, and back on the trip!!"
4931993,ziggyzag,2016-06-16 10:36:00,125,gmattbruin: Have a great time I know you will and tell your dad to go fish Frank's spot which is the big rock half way between Pup island and the river mouths on the east shore line. This spot is named after my Father who passed away last year and who loved to jig fish an area just like this. Be safe and give us a report when you return.
6293168,Guest,2019-02-25 15:42:00,0,Have you been back to Abby Lake since 2016? Headed up in August. Jeff

4907905,ziggyzag,2016-06-07 09:48:00,125,"Just got back from our trip to Abamasagi Lake out of Nakina as reported by others on here this lake is indeed a walleye factory. We stayed at cabin #3 with TLO and the accommodation for an outpost where very nice the flight in was on time 5:30 am the boats and motors ran well and the dock was nice. As far as the weather goes it was one of the worst weeks I have ever had rain, wind and cold 6 out of 7 days made for staying out in the boat a little tough but thats spring time fishing i guess. Now for the fishing! we had (14) men or (7) boats on the water most days and averaged 100 fish per boat just about every day mostly walleye with a couple of dozen pike per boat thrown in in fact there were a couple of days where a few boats caught over 200 fish in a day. Biggest Pike 42"" 23 lbs. Biggest Walleye 27' 6-7 lbs We did catch a few dozen walleye in the 23-25"" range with the average being 17-18"" We mostly jig fished with white being the hottest color on 1/4 oz. pink jig heads I know as a group we boated well over 4000 walleye and 400 pike for the week everyone had a great time and cant wait for the next trip. We named the big rock that sticks out of the water half way between Pup Island an the river Franks Rock after my dad this was one of the hottest jig fishing spots on the lake the week we where their drop jig down hit bottom set hook land fish one after the other unbelievable!!!!"
4908193,adempsey,2016-06-07 11:52:00,963,"Definitely a Walleye factory, awesome! Even with the adverse conditions you guys still pounded the fish. I'd love to spend a week up there sometime and will assuredly hit Franks Rock.Were you guys all able to stay at cabin#3?Thanks for the report."
4908241,acplumber,2016-06-07 12:05:00,80,Wow 4000 fishThat's awesome I've spoken to gmattbruin and he has said the same about being a walleye factory!It's on my short list for sureAny luck with lake trout?Is there a lot of em in there?I love catching walleye and pike all week long but nothing hits like a laker!
4908297,ziggyzag,2016-06-07 12:35:00,125,yes we all stayed at cabin #3 it has a main cabin that sleeps (10) and a smaller sleeper cabin that sleeps (4) ice house and fish cleaning house.
4908305,ziggyzag,2016-06-07 12:38:00,125,There are lakers in Aba but not that many so I am told but the ones they catch are nice fish so I hear. We did not fish for them at all but was hoping to pick one up by accident but did not happen for us.
4908569,gmattbruin,2016-06-07 14:34:00,174,"Awesome summary Jeff of a great trip. As far as Lakers, they are there but generally as most know they love the deep water. Out front and down abit from #3 is a hole, 80'+ deep. We have rigged up the 3way hookups and dragged some spoons thru tht hole several times with no luck. Then one yr, one of our guys was fish up by the island off cabins 1&2 and in abt 6-8' of water...laker....lol.....goes to show you, we never know"
4917769,gmattbruin,2016-06-11 10:02:00,174,"Hey Jeff, I pm you but figure ill ask here openly as well. We have always taken our nets for each boat for camp#....im just wondering if Chad has nets now? Im kinda doubting that kinda luxury but ya never know"
4918385,ziggyzag,2016-06-11 18:24:00,125,gmattbruin: No nets and my hands can testify to that LOL!!! I attached some pictures will post more later.
4918825,gmattbruin,2016-06-12 05:36:00,174,"Ok, thx Jeff, thats kinda what i figured. Nets sure arent a big deal to bring. Great pics btw....I would say by the looks of the weather-water you had PERFECT walleye conditions....a little more chop and it couldnt get any better.....love the rolls for drifting jigs....called the walleye chop!!!"
4921785,lassh,2016-06-13 05:36:00,553,Sounds like a great trip Ziggy. Thanks for posting.
