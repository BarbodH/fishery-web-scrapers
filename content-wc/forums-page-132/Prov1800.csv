6293830,5ofDiamonds,2019-02-27 20:16:00,5,Talked to the new owner this week and it sounds like they will be offer the same services as before and expand into a few new things. I called there to see if Dutchie's will be doing fishing licences because I saw on facebook that 4 seasons isn't. He said he was going to be doing them and to watch for updates on facebook @dutchiesgeneralstore

6291298,vaquero01,2019-02-19 14:47:00,101,We were at Onaway Aug 24 to Sept 7 last year. Changed hands during that time frame.
6291716,AB,2019-02-20 17:04:00,61,"The transfer of ownership began late last season. New owners were running it then, previous owner is supposed to come back and help start back up for a period at the start of this season. I spoke to both parties while I was there in August."
6291748,bearfvr13,2019-02-20 18:10:00,174,"Thanks to all who have responded, I'm sure the new owners will be fine. But I'm gonna miss Rikki and the pooch! Thanks again everybody! Chuck"
6291916,jambi,2019-02-21 08:06:00,504,"We stop here coming and going. Coming - excited, anxious, and happy. Going - tired, tired, and tired."
6291984,MikeinMN,2019-02-21 10:21:00,190,"I talked a little with the new owner last late summer. He's a really nice guy and pretty knowledgeable about area fishing, especially Lac Seul and points north. He mentioned he has worked in the bush for quite some time in various capacities and is ready for a little change. I wish him gook luck and look forward to a Dutchie's stop this spring!"
6292014,billy weaver,2019-02-21 11:17:00,470,"I always stop at Dutchies on my way to Peffley's Camp. I buy my license, pick up a flat of nightcrawlers and a few last minute items. I call ahead as cost of a flat of nightcrawlers is fair and they have always been in good shape. This service is one I sure wouldn't want to lose. I expect that their service will continue as it sure is handy. I have been stopping at Dutchies for 30 years and the owners have always been nice."
