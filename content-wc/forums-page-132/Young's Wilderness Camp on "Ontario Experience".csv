This camp is really well run; great equipment, food, fishing, etc. I did 10 trips here with my Dad from 2000 to 2009 before his health lessoned and he finally passed away. When I get up in age I will retire from fly-outs and go back to YWC! PS I even saw a glipse of WC's ""HAWKER"" in here, he's in the light green shirt mixing the fish batter at the shore lunch clip. below is the YouTube link.... Enjoy!https://youtu.be/A2X_erJWHcs"
