6295838,rzep,2019-03-05 17:21:00,1196,"I stayed there about over 10 years ago. The fishing was good and I got my first Musky right off the island... 42-44 inches...Having said so, the cabins were run down and food was so so but I am picky.. Not sure who runs the place now .. the old man who was in charge was in his 60s back then ... wonder if his young son/wife took over and cleaned it up."
