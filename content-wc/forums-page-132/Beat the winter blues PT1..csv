I take waaaay too much tackle but like to be prepared for any and every situation I foresee, but most if not all my fish were caught on live bait under a bobber or a Berkeley Ripple shad on an Owner 6/0 Beast swimsuit hook or a jig head. This was the first year my son jack managed to wake up early enough to follow me fishing, of course he outfished me and landed a beautiful snook, not bad for his first sea fish caught.VIDEOhttps://youtu.be/UKNpPwLfQzg"
