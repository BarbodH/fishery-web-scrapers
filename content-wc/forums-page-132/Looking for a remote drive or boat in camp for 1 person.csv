6293836,5ofDiamonds,2019-02-27 20:29:00,5,I've heard that J and M Wilderness Camp is the kind of remote location that you are looking for. I don't think they have a website - but are on facebook
6294430,RichA$1970,2019-03-01 20:57:00,1159,"Scratch the post as my friend, his son n my dad decided to do a fly in north of Red lake. Still would like to do a loner trip sometime for peace n quiet."
6270764,v-bay gord,2018-12-21 08:37:00,3168,"PJ....while I know that you are most often right, some might even say legendary, in this case you are misleading the OP. The price you are referring to is ""per person"" based on there being two people (in Canadian $ which basically is 30% less when paying in US). As someone else posted, there might be a chance for a discounted single person rate closer to the season but not this far ahead. Sorry to burst your bubble."
6272510,billy weaver,2018-12-27 13:09:00,470,"Peffley's camp on Wabaskang has a small 1 or 2 man cabin primarily used for overflow from the other cabins. You have to use a walk to shower and toilet (but it is nice with hot water etc.). It has a small kitchen area. The rate is cheaper on this cabin, rate include boat and motor. You might check Peffley's web-site. I think you would have to contact Peffley for the special rate on this cabin."
6272902,emma17,2018-12-28 12:48:00,436,"Obabikon is a boat-in and although on LOW, it's pretty remote. Excellent camp and location. $800 may be an issue for a full week as I think it's American Plan. They have some smaller cabins that may work for one."
6273138,camp chef,2018-12-29 10:28:00,915,Call Dan Houles at Stokes Bay. East end of Rainy Lake boat in.
6273144,That Minnesota guy,2018-12-29 10:55:00,8293,"That might be a good option. I know I see their boat docked on the Ash River Trail all the time. That would shorten the drive time by a hour at least. Leave from the Ash River Trail and boat to Kettle Falls, do the mechanical portage and you are there! Great idea."
6274052,lenray,2019-01-01 10:20:00,467,Why look for a camp if you have your own boat and are not afraid to go it alone. You mentioned Pickle Lake---go there and drive the 150 miles-max. or miles less than 150 and put your boat into the river systems. Go up or down river. I do that...Also take a canoe and portage off the main river-lake system. Tent-beans and more eyes than you can handle............Very cheap--just the per night fee that is around 12 bucks per night and cheaper if you stay on Indian land and get the permit in Pickle Lake.....I like to eat the eyes but always get a few tooth guys at 40 inches plus and they are all still there--never kill a big guy or a big eye.....
6274076,RichA$1970,2019-01-01 11:13:00,1159,. I need to rent a boat so that does limit some ideas. Going to the All Canada Show to see if any other options come up n thx to All for their advice n input as I have a couple good options. Going solo at least let’s me go on my schedule
6274110,lenray,2019-01-01 13:10:00,467,Rent a boat----I just take an old 14 footer with a 15 HP Johnson or smaller and a 3 HP Johnson for the square back canoe. In those waters I fish a guy doesn't want a big fancy boat--those lakes are full of big rocks etc. I have been fishing the same water since 2002. Sometimes two times per year and the water including the river system is about 25 miles long and in all those years have NEVER seen another boat or fisherman............This is drive to water but still secluded..................
6274232,RichA$1970,2019-01-01 18:16:00,1159,I have an old ‘58 14’ Crestliner w a 9.9 Johnson but not going to haul it up all the way there. Thx for the info n fun to plan this trip. I really appreciate everyone’s feedback.
6274240,lenray,2019-01-01 18:44:00,467,I drive and haul two boats--one a canoe. It is 1200 miles one way......just saying. To each their own.......................
6270218,RichA$1970,2018-12-19 19:49:00,1159,"I have been doing fly ins with Chimo in Red Lake but my dad moved to Florida n the other 2 are having some health issues. I am looking for a remote drive or boat in in Ontario n based on cost, I don’t mind camping but would need a boat n motor. Would like to keep it to under $800 for the week. Several spots I am interested in that would be helpful are1). O’Sullivans rainbow lodge2. Camp Lake St Joseph or Oz Lake lodge3. Pickle Lake outposts- says they will fly you to a remote lake with a boat to camp. 4. Lower Twin Lake LodgeAny other options that are not too crowded would be appreciated. Walleyes n Northerns are what I am targeting."
6270258,btyreprich,2018-12-20 04:35:00,1067,"I have fishes Lake St Joseph in the past - staying at a different camp than the one you have looked at. Have to say that this lake is unbelievable when it comes to numbers of Walleyes. Even a ""bad"" day is pretty good fishing. It's on my bucket list to get back to this lake after I retire."
6270262,pjshorthorn,2018-12-20 05:16:00,5654,"Take a look at Black Bear Lodge on Red Lake. Rustic camp with a nice lodge, all meals included. Good northern and walleye fishing.http://www.fishblackbear.com/ PjShorthorn"
6270312,BornToFish,2018-12-20 06:52:00,1224,"Greetings, Lodge owners are often reluctant to book a guest flying solo this early relative to the upcoming season. Many lodge owners would rather have a chance at booking a larger group in the same cabin when they participate in the ""show season"": e.g. the All Canada Shows. Lodge owners see it as ""lost revenue"" when they book a single guest as there is no one else in the cabin. I know of some lodge owners that will only book a solo guest if they agree to pay 1.5x or twice the per person fee of a larger group. The original poster might do well making enquiries after the show season is over (e.g. April). Lodge owners have pretty much exhausted their opportunities by then to book larger groups in their cabins. Some lodge owners might bite on booking a solo guest, thinking that something is better than nothing. This approach to booking a fishing trip may require the original poster to do his homework now in terms of identifying desirable fishing lodges and being able to quickly ""pull the trigger"". I understand that it's not comforting letting something like booking a fishing vacation float until the last moment, but it might prove to be your only option. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6270440,RichA$1970,2018-12-20 11:25:00,1159,. Thanks n the only drawback to St Joe is 1 barbless treble hook per lure. I see you are in Yorkville n I used to live in Sugar Grove. Thanks
6270448,RichA$1970,2018-12-20 11:28:00,1159,. Thanks and valid points. Pickle Lake Outposts says they will fly you in to a lake with a boat n has there n then you camp on your own which would be quiet week. I do think you are right to see if there are any cancellations as it does not hurt to ask. Thanks
6270456,Bill Krejca,2018-12-20 11:36:00,6107,"O'Sullivan's has a small camping area, near the water, fishing is good, price should be OK for you. Nice area, accommodating owners, well run, nothing fancy but should meet your expectations. Bill"
6270514,Mojo-NC,2018-12-20 13:34:00,1929,"I don't think I'd ever consider fishing a remote Canada lake alone. Number one reason = safety. Boat control is also difficult enough with 2 guys in those small aluminum boats, with only 1 you'd get blown all over the place. Who'd net your fish, take pictures of the good ones before release, help get the buried hook out of your hand, or help you drive when you're tired? Nope, I don't think I'd ever consider going up alone. If you're determined to do so, maybe a lodge owner can pair you up with a group that has an odd number of anglers."
6270696,stjoeguy,2018-12-21 06:26:00,979,"Another suggestion is to keep watching Walleye Central for posts about group openings. I and others have filled out groups in the past by ""advertising"" on Walleye Central and met some great guys."
6270700,pjshorthorn,2018-12-21 06:30:00,5654,Second suggestion would be Vermilion Bay Lodge on Eagle Lake. I posted some info on another thread where you had inquired about lodges .http://vermilionbaylodge.com/ I'm heading there the week of June 15th. If you want more detail send me a PM. The price fits into your budget. PjShorthorn
