6295846,psherbo,2019-03-05 17:40:00,13,Has anyone had any recent experience with going to Lake Theodat Legoff or Tesacau with Dreamcatcher Outfitters since Abel Kitchen has died. We have been in contact w his son Jordan but have extremely sketchy plans w him. Have not been able to reach him for months. Had similar experience w/ Able but he always came thru w cabins. Did 3 trips w Abel in the past to Theodat.Thanks.
