6289468,Ricky Spanish,2019-02-13 15:08:00,1298,"Tulibee are slimy, too, and smell super fishy but have an underbite. I think it's a whitefish. Whitefish have an overbite, like a sucker. This looks to have that type of mouth."
6289476,BornToFish,2019-02-13 15:24:00,1224,"Greetings, I apologize in advance for hijacking this thread. Ricky: I haven't seen you on this forum for a while. How is Mrs. Ricky? Are you folks headed to Canada this season? I hope so. Good fishing and tight lines!!"

6294012,Ricky Spanish,2019-02-28 14:21:00,1298,"Mrs. Spanish is doing well, thanks. We are booked and cannot wait to get back to Temple Bay in June. I just learned a short while ago that the infamous pjshorthorn gang will be in v-bay at the same time. What could go wrong?"

6289002,Mojo-NC,2019-02-12 14:23:00,1929,I caught this little guy in the current while walleye fishing at the base of the falls of one lake leading into another in NW Ontario. It's pretty large for a baitfish but I don't know what species it is. Anyone?
6289012,BornToFish,2019-02-12 14:48:00,1224,"Greetings, It's a bit difficult for me to identify the fish with certainty. The mouth being held open because of the hook makes it challenging to see what direction the mouth/jaws point. It appears that the fish was caught during the time of the year with cool weather and water temperatures. Approximately how long is the fish? My first guess is that the mystery fish is a whitefish. My second guess would be a ciscoe. I have caught quite a few whitefish in shallow water during the first week of the season. I could never count on catching them, but they just happened from time to time. Anyway, whitefish is my guess. I look forward to hearing the thoughts of others! Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6289014,Wall-i-Lama,2019-02-12 14:48:00,1524,"Whitefish is my guess too. I like them smoked.While they look like a carp or sucker, they are actually a member of Salmonids family. A little oily and that is why the smoke up pretty good.The whitefish and Cisco are hard to tell part especially when small. It's hard to tell from this photo, but the white fish usually has a snout that protrudes over the lower jaw just a bit. I'm going with Whitefish."
6289044,Mojo-NC,2019-02-12 15:43:00,1929,"Thanks, my guess was a cisco, but then again, I thought a cisco and a whitefish were the same fish by different names. I guess not."
6289046,fsz,2019-02-12 15:43:00,144,"Cisco probably not (based on overall size and width of the fish-Cisco's don't get as big as white fish and are not very wide). Whitefish- maybe Based on the â quill â like projection on the dorsal fin, my guess is a carpsucker, aka quillback or quillback carpsucker. A boney rough fish."
6289052,adempsey2.0,2019-02-12 15:47:00,611,"Whitefish or Herring (Cisco). Without seeing the mouth/tail better, it's difficult to tell for sure, but I would lean more toward Whitefish. The mouth definitely looks more like a whitefish though."
6289064,prov1800,2019-02-12 16:17:00,5010,Looks like a tulibee to me.they can look similar to other fish.but tulibees have very tiny teeth.
6289098,kzoofisher,2019-02-12 17:18:00,5144,"I'm going to go with coregonus clupeaformus a.k.a Otsego bass, Sault whitefish, gizzard fish, common whitefish, eastern whitefish, Great Lakes whitefish, humpback whitefish, inland whitefish and whitefish.
