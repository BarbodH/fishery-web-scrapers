1116096,Guest,2009-06-24 12:14:00,0,The lineups were out the door yesterday for people to get their booze. The whole thing smells to high heaven. There was old less undesirable stock and shortages of the good stuff. People bought old stock rather than go without.
1116205,clemento,2009-06-24 19:09:00,48,Will this impact duty free store in International Falls?
1116285,adempsey,2009-06-25 00:01:00,963,They reached an agreement. So no strike and no worries.
1116386,Guest,2009-06-25 12:14:00,0,They had the largest single days sale ever. Some srores hasd nothing left in them.
1116485,St. Clair Slayer,2009-06-25 18:26:00,27,Cheers!
1116707,tly,2009-06-26 19:11:00,1900,Do we go to fish or drink?

1115828,teddi,2009-06-23 12:38:00,349,the liquors stores in ontario are going on strike at midnite to nite. make sure you are stocked up for your stay. it could be very dry for a while.
1115835,hawg,2009-06-23 13:05:00,2008,"They are open in friendly Minnesota, come on down!"
1115843,hawks_rule,2009-06-23 13:24:00,115,The natives will be restless..........
1115851,Bill Krejca,2009-06-23 14:38:00,6107,"So, how about the stores which sell both beer and booze - like some smaller town grocery stores? Bill Krejca"
1115862,GNO,2009-06-23 15:37:00,153,"The LCBO outlets stores will be able to sell their stock, but when it is gone, they will not get any new stock to replace it. Plan accordingly"
1115872,BuckeyeATC,2009-06-23 15:54:00,88,I wonder what they'll do at the border going into Canada with the LCBOs shut down??? Unlimited bottles of liquor allowed in without duty??!!!!
1115877,teddi,2009-06-23 16:12:00,349,"the smaller outlets will still be open as long as there is stock. when it,s gone there is no more. the border rules don,t change. you may still get beer."
1115905,joeman79,2009-06-23 17:34:00,417,"I doubt there will be a long strike in Canada, if so there will most likely be a HUGE Revolution by thier owns citizens."
1116046,elmo,2009-06-24 08:49:00,43,I guess they can import more from the USofA!
1116047,Jig Man,2009-06-24 09:00:00,95,"The Liquor Control Board of Ontario and its unionized workers made a last-minute decision late yesterday night to put aside talk of going on strike - at least for now - and continue negotiations. A statement posted on the website of the Ontario Public Service Employees Union just 40 minutes before its midnight strike deadline suggested a deal could be reached ""before long"" and talks would continue until an agreement is reached or one or both parties walk away from the table."
