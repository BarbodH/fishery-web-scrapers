My father leaves Indianapolis on Friday(June 26) night around 5 or 6 and drives to Sullivan County Indiana and we depart on Saturday morning around 4:00am. We drive straight through and arrive at base camp around 10 or 11 pm. We sleep in base camp Saturday night and fly-in Sunday morning. We fish 5 days (Sun.-Thurs.). We fly-out Friday morning and head home. We will probably stay in or near Madison, Wisconsin Friday nightand get home Saturday afternoon. Cost will be around $1900 for EVERYTHING(food, gas lodging, etc...) We could maybe pick someone up on the way or meet someone from Canada at Sioux Lookout or somewhere in Canada My dad started going here in 1969. We know the lake. We will catch lots and lots of walleye. Average size is 17-19 inches. Quite a few in the 20-23 range and an occasional 25+. My biggest is 28 inches and 8 pounds. Each trip will usually produce at least one northern of 15 pounds or bigger. Otto Clements"
