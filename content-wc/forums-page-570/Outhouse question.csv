1115894,Steve of Madison,2009-06-23 16:58:00,230,"Did he answer the question about whether the fishing is REALLY good enough to put up with no indor plumbing! With my ....uhh... problem, trying to carve a path in a semi-drunken, sleep deprived, urgently needed state to an outhouse, the fishing had better be freaking incredible!!!!! And the cost had better be ""attractive"" as well.But you have to hand it to the wife, if she is OK with it, so be it. Mine has no interest in coming along, and that makes me one of the luckiest men on earth."
1115967,elmo,2009-06-23 21:19:00,43,If the wife did not go I guess I could make 2 trips a year. But most of the guys I fish with just talk about going to Canada. They can not pull the trigger and go so the trip is usally us and maybe my son and some of his buddies.
1116036,Steve of Madison,2009-06-24 08:18:00,230,"I know all about ""those guys"". Come back home and everyone is asking to go along next time. But when it's time to put some money in the game, they fold up like a cheap suit. I ask once, if they wimp out, no more invites from me."
1116224,Pooch,2009-06-24 20:22:00,4619,"I agree with you fellows. Most guys talk a good trip, but bail out when it comes down to committing. That's why camps usually don't refund deposits unless there are ""circumstances"". And yes Steve of Madison, I did answer that the lake was well worth an outhouse facility! And no the price is still not cheap, but like I said worth every penny to us. Our group goes to fish and we fish hard. Not to get drunk or stay up all night horsing around. Who wants to be hurling into an outhouse or chumming outside the cabin for bear? Besides that we are old farts and got that silliness out of our systems a long time ago! Some of us just took a little longer than others....... Pooch"
1116625,oleJoe,2009-06-26 12:40:00,114,This yr our outfitter placed urinal block in a tray in the outhouse and it worked great on the smell. But then again it didn't get above 50.
1116640,AllenW,2009-06-26 13:28:00,11482,"A little tip for outhouse and cold weather, cut a 2"" thick block of styrofoam that's larger than the hole, then cut a hole in it the same size as the hole in the outhouse, sitting on that is much nicer than a cold board.Al"
1116674,pegasis0066,2009-06-26 16:13:00,64,+100I have even consider retro-fitting the home toilet seats with styrofoam - I swear as soon as you sit down it is instant warmth (like it is heated).
1113752,pegasis0066,2009-06-15 13:29:00,64,"While you have a point, many women (including my own) despise having to go into a porta-john."
1113784,teddi,2009-06-15 15:44:00,349,leave wife at home. no problem.
1113870,Pooch,2009-06-15 20:19:00,4619,"Is the fishing worth using an outhouse? Yes. I live in the same house I was born in and we grew up using the outhouse. I don't remember it stinking that much, but then again there wasn't anything else to compare it to! Thanks for the replies everyone. If I listened to some of you rummies, I'd be single again..... Think of it this way, who would you rather see walking around in their underwear, your wife or your fishing buddies? Yea, I suppose it depends on the wife... Better quit kicking this dog while I'm ahead. Pooch"
1113880,muskyman73,2009-06-15 20:44:00,402,"Teddi, I just coughed up my brat and beer all over my keyboard !!!!! Too funny dude. Leaving the P.O. at home will put him in the doghouse for sure."
1114030,Bill Krejca,2009-06-16 10:31:00,6107,"Pooch, Another suggestion sure to help your cause - bring along a bag of pig manure, and scatter a little around, it will make the other smells seem better! I could send you some from good old Ioway! Bill Krejca"
1114125,elmo,2009-06-16 15:26:00,43,"My wife pays the bills and for the fishing trip, so she goes to fish and have a good time. She knows the outhouse is in the mix and lives with it or she could stay home. If the outhouse is the worst part of the trip for her she would go every time. Not all of the outhouses smell that bad, a babies diaper can be worse! My wife fixed our last cabin with 2 rooms and a path up (outhouse) Photo enclosed. It really made things better."
1114198,v-bay gord,2009-06-16 19:39:00,3168,Crown Royal in the crapper.....now that's class!

1114244,Guest,2009-06-16 22:59:00,0,"I thought I would share this story with you guys. About 15 years ago, I stayed at a place that had outhouses. Well I got done going the bathroom, pulled my pants up, and went back to the cabin to wash my hands. Got done doing that and to my horror, noticed my wallet was missing! Sure enough, is was down the hole I,d just crapped in, $1,500 bucks!!. Well, I did'nt dare tell any of the guys, be a long week. if you know what I mean. So I went into the garage, grabbed two 2x4's, and dug it out, what a stinking mess!! Then I washed it of with the hose, WHUUH!! All my sneakyness did'nt pay off, somebody saw me do this and it sure as ****, I caught alot of grief the rest of the week from the rest of the guys. I still catch **** about it to this day. LOL!"
1114769,Guest,2009-06-18 17:58:00,0,A properly constructed and maintained outhouse does not stink. It needs microbes and moisture to make it work. I spread a half shovel of earth in the pit and a half pail of water once a week. Venting is important as well as as a contained pit. Never had a problem
1113579,Pooch,2009-06-15 02:55:00,4619,"One of the camps we fished in the past had an outhouse for each cabin. Every few days the owner would dump something down the hole and it knocked down the odor. Any idea what it was? My wife is going to ""the boys"" camp with me this year and I need to make the outhouse as acceptable to her as I can. She has used outhouses at other camps over the years and tolerates it only because the choices are few! One thing ""the boys"" do is we have a spray can of Yard Guard in the outhouse and spray it down the hole before each use hoping to eliminate any bugs lingering...... That helps a bunch. Anything more I can do? Need a little help to make this part of the trip easier. Suggestions? Thanks, Pooch"
1113585,Hawker,2009-06-15 05:04:00,3967,"Mu guess is the camp owner was using lime. That's what we used to use growing up and it also helps to break down the ""deposits"" as well."
1113594,elmo,2009-06-15 05:50:00,43,Keeping the lid shut will help if the house has a vent out the top of the roof. The other things you can do is dump some wood ashes down the hole or dump a bucket of water in the hole everyday. And yes lime is the answer. You could take some mothballs along with you we have done that before. Good luck
1113601,campchick,2009-06-15 06:05:00,96,There is also a product called Septo Clean that works very well. Sold in Home Hardware stores.
1113617,Bill Krejca,2009-06-15 07:18:00,6107,"I know they used to use lime, but it seems like for some reason it was not supposed to be used. Darned if I can remember why. Bill Krejca"
1113624,pegasis0066,2009-06-15 07:50:00,64,You don't need an outhouse - find a good log or tree for support. Just bury anything you leave behind. Sitting over an enclosed hole where countless others have crapped is gross and unnecessary.
1113679,Guest,2009-06-15 09:51:00,0,How good is the fishing that you go to a camp w/o indoor plumbing?
1113693,Mohleye,2009-06-15 10:35:00,368,Back in my Boy Scout camp days they used to pour pine oil in the outhouse pits. It was pretty strong but smelled better than the alternative. Maybe someting like a Pinesol would be worth a try.
1113715,joeman79,2009-06-15 11:51:00,417,"You can go buy the stuff they put in porta potties, you should be able to get at an RV supply store. Google outhouse odor control lots of stuff there."
1113734,v-bay gord,2009-06-15 12:47:00,3168,"I'ld like to see you try and convince a woman that all she needs to do is find a good tree.....""oh, by the way honey take this here shovel to bury your pile"""
