1115327,norsky,2009-06-21 17:48:00,16,Can we import crawlers into Ontario if packed in bedding this year????
1115329,csnez,2009-06-21 17:58:00,9,Just crossed the border with a flat in bedding. They did ask if they were in paper bedding when we crossed. Paid $49 at home and saw they were $69 at Rainy River Sports in Ft. Frances. Nice Large leeches were $39 a pound also.
1115631,alanexpup,2009-06-22 18:15:00,278,where do you get them from? do you order them through the mail or what? thanks
1115959,deehawk,2009-06-23 20:40:00,178,We order our crawlers online from Vados bait. They will pack them in artificial bedding for Canadian Customs. Brian
1116172,Guest,2009-06-24 16:59:00,0,I pick up all the crawlers I want out of my back yard following a soaking rain......pack them in paper bedding to cross into Canada...cost??? A little of my time and $3.97 for a bag of bedding! Enjoy everyday of fishing like it's your last! Wallace
1116184,Boots,2009-06-24 17:50:00,19,CSNEZ. You said they asked you at customs if you had them in paper bedding. Would paper bedding be unlawfull? I shredded some cardboard 2 months ago and had intended to take them acrooss in the shredded cardboard. Hope this will not be unlawfull.
1116186,bad fisherman,2009-06-24 18:11:00,13,as long as you don't have them in dirt or comparable you will be fine. they are worried about the dirt being contaminated with a potatoe beetle or other invasive subjects. paper is processed and there fore is free of contamination. Have fun fishing! I leave in two weeks for minnitaki
1116229,csnez,2009-06-24 20:40:00,9,"As Bad Fisherman said, They just don't want them in dirt. Same reason for not allowing potatoes across the border. Kind of odd being most of the crawlers we get here are Canadian Crawlers in canadian dirt but can't take it across the border. The worm bedding you buy at the local bait shop is a paper product and works well."
1116366,Whopper,2009-06-25 10:46:00,340,"I'd like to add something here, four years ago we followed the guide lines, crawlers were bought two weeks ahead of time, had the receipt and they were cleaned and packed in the proper bedding three days before our trip up. We were stopped at the Pigeon River crossing and was asked to bring the crawlers inside for inspection. The border guard that inspected the worms denied the crawlers entry and made us turn around and dispose them. I asked him why and he said there was to much poop in the proper bedding. Made our way to Thunder Bay and bought another flat. Been going to Canada since 1977 and that was first and only time we had our crawlers inspected. Just an FYI"
1116393,alanexpup,2009-06-25 12:29:00,278,they must having a slow day at that crossing. thats the trouble at crossing with no traffic they take extra time to do stupid things.
