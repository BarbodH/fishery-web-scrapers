1114333,South Dakota,2009-06-17 08:53:00,24,Thanks for the tip! I will be there the last two weeks of July and will give it a try.
1114863,Guest,2009-06-19 04:43:00,0,"Thanks for the replies. We leave northern, il in 3 hrs. Report when I return sun 28th."
1116132,Guest,2009-06-24 14:45:00,0,I heard the water is so low you cant get to mckenzie from the north. Just kidding...does anyone know what the weather has been like and what the water temp has been? Thanks
1113627,wesman40,2009-06-15 07:52:00,45,"Can someone confirm where Big Sands and Little Sands are on LS? Neither my map or GPS display these spots. I thought this was the area on the east shoreline between Ghost Narrows and Windigo Pt.Also, any tips for fishing this spot? Thinking that slow death, spinners, and jig/grub should have it covered.Thanks in advance, we'll be fishing 6/20 to 6/26.WD"
1113641,WalleyeWally28,2009-06-15 08:09:00,298,"I assume you are looking for Big Sandbanks and Little Sandbanks, both of which are located on the East end of McKenzie Bay. Big Sandbanks is East of Ghost Narrows about two miles and Little Sandbanks is a short distance North and East of that. Both are shown on most maps I've seen. Hope this helps you - have a great trip."
1113644,Steve of Madison,2009-06-15 08:15:00,230,"I believe you are refering to the sand banks.The Big Sand Bank is north of Ghost Narrows in McKenzie Bay, the Small Sand Banks are just South of Ghost Narrows on the east side of the bay. They are easy to spot from a long distance because the banks are 40 to 50 yd high and in the afternoon sun, shine quite brightly.Both obviously have a sand bottom. I am more familiar with the small Bank but there are alot of others on this thread that hit the Big Bank or both more often that I do."
1113740,Guest,2009-06-15 13:10:00,0,"wesman: Don't forget to try leeches, they could be hot. If the water temps start to creep into the low 60s, give them a try."
1113745,Guest,2009-06-15 13:20:00,0,"I have only fished the big sand banks, just follow the boats...haha anyway the boats are usually stacked in there pretty good so you have to hoover with a jig or slowly work around the corner with a jig. not enough room to troll through there usually..has anybody fished the little sandbanks? The big sandbanks were red hot on my first trip to lac seul 4 years ago, but have not been productive for me since.... I'm going up july 11th and will be looking for your report.."
1113789,WalleyeWally28,2009-06-15 15:51:00,298,"Have fished LS for 12 years and usually stop by the Big Sandbanks once or twice a trip. Fishing can be fast and furious or dead depending on wind and general weather conditions. If the bite is on you will see at least 10 - 15 boats in the area. This does make it extremely difficult to fish (we normally stay for a short time and then move on ). Generally we've found the walleyes to be mostly eater size with a few slot fish mixed in. We first fished the Little Sandbanks 12 years ago with a guide. Over the years we have gone back a few times and had some luck. Usually there are very few boats, if any, in the area. The walleyes have generally run a little bigger but the bite is not as fast.Hope this is of some help."
1113804,teddi,2009-06-15 17:14:00,349,"if the banks are full fish ghost narrows instead. just a little bit south of the sand banks. i,ve found the fishing better than the sand banks at times."
1113858,LoDo,2009-06-15 19:47:00,721,I agree with Teddy. The ghost narrows has two islands between mainland and the Big Island. Their is also a rock that sticks out of the water where I've located fish.If you are in the Ghost Narrows look south towards Manitoba point and you'll see two small islands in the middle of the lake. Between the islands the depth is roughly 8-12ft. Fish the side of the islands that the wind is blowing into.
1114297,South Dakota,2009-06-17 06:41:00,24,"Hey LoDo, are you talking about the two islands before the cormorant islands? I have fished that area as well and don't believe I've seen any one around the cormorant islands. Thanks"
1114319,LoDo,2009-06-17 08:11:00,721,"South Dakota,Yes! I have never fished the Cormonant Islands but the islands between the Ghost Narrows and the Cormonat islands I have fished and did really well. We fished the southwest corner of the east island in 6-8ft of water. Their is alot of rock and it was very windy. You'll want a experienced individual manning the boat.We would troll to the south of that corner and drift in using jigs and minnows or bottom bouncers."
