The weather appears to have returned to a more seasonable pattern. I have all the gear ready to go. The boat is ship shape. And I have a new weapon this year...my Humminbird 788ci with Navionics Premium of the Cabonga Resevoir! I am a happy man right now. I can't believe the quality of that map. I am so looking forward to using that this year."
