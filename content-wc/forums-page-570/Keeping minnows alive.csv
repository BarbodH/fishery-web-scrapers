Would you care to share your experience? Right now the lakes are warming up and there is a layer of pollen along the shoreline. Thanks to all that reply."
1115045,eyemike,2009-06-19 18:34:00,233,I have a 5 gal. bucket that I drilled a bunch of small quarter inch holes in. I put my minnows in and put the lid back on. Then find some currant somewhere on the lake and sink the bucket tying it off along the shore with a long rope. You can put a whole weeks worth of minnows in the bucket and just refill your minnow bucket each day. The currant filters through the 5 gal. bucket keeping the minnows pretty active. You can pack your minnow bucket and rope right in the 5 gal bucket going in. anywhere on the lake where there is a nice flow works.

Also, the water will not run all over your shoe. The lid can be drilled as well, for better water circulation, and to aid in letting the air out when sinking the bucket. You do not want the bucket to float, as the minnows will have to spend too much energy in any wave action, and many will die. A small weight (rock, etc) can be placed in the bucket, but use as small as possible, as the weight will take up room. When I used this type of rig, I made a thumbscrew attachment to hold the lid on, do not rely on it just snapping together and expect the lid to stay on. Try to get the bucket in as deep of water as possible, wave action can go surprisingly deep, you don't want the bucket to rock, as this also will hasten the minnows demise. This rig will work in a lake that doesn't have current, per se, and will keep most of the bait alive for a week. A few will die each day, clean them out each time you bring the bucket up. Good luck, don't forget to tie a rope to the bucket! Bill Krejca"

It is very quiet and runs off (2) D batteries or your 12V trolling motor battery. You can switch between power supplies at any time with the switch. I've had minnows stay alive for 4 days straight. If it's real hot throw in a few ice cubes or changeout the water. I had the Frabill Minnow bucket with the aeriator hanging from the side. They are very loud and will drive you ""nuts"" after awhile. If you are in an outpost camp try using a frozen cooler pack in the bucket. They stay cold along time."
