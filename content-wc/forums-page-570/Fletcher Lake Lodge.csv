Our party of 6 boated approx. 1800 plus in 3.25 days. The party leaving just before us had a spectacular morning of 200 fish per boat - that was 1 fish per person every two minutes for 3.5 hours! We didn't see it get hat high, but it still was a grand time. The fabled 100 fish per person days, etc. Walleye over the entire range - many 20-22"", several 24"", one 27.5 and one 30"". A ton in the 15-20 range. Pike were all hammer handle, although the lake is know for larger - up to 36-40"". Picked up two perch, both 14"" (monsters!). Didn't target smallmouth, but the three we got were 16-17"". Do a google search, a highly redommended place for a remote adventure."
