1116709,elkman99,2009-06-26 19:19:00,180,I'm heading up north this next weekend and am thinking of driving into Ord for a day to musky and walleye fish. How is the road going in? Are the musky large/numerous enough to even mess with going? Thanks!

Puzzle Bay on Ord is my favorite walleye fishing spot in all of North America. 30 years of great memories from that water. Don't know about muskies, since I don't fish for them, but Ord is always worth a day's trip for walleyes.The last week in May this year the road had not been graded and was too rough to haul our boats in so we skipped Ord this year. Hopefully someone who's been in the area since my trip will post more information on the road.P.S. I'm talking about the road in from Hwy. 105. I think it's called Nancy Rd., the one that goes east from Hwy.105 just a mile or so south of Deer Lake Rd. into the south end of Cliff Lake. Sure wish someone would rebuild the bridge that's out on Camp Robinson Rd. so we could once again use that access to Ord."
