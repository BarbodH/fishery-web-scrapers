When we were there, about the same time of year that you will be there, we fished a shoreline that I would say was northwest of the resort. North of Gull rock. It was a sandy shore and we anchored 20 yards from shore and pitched jigs towards shore. We let the jig drag the bottom as we brought it in and just nailed the walleyes. I think the record was 14 casts in a row catching a fish without a miss. We also fished in the evenings to the west of the resort in an area that narrows down. There used to be some jugs marking rocks and we slip bobbered there and caught plenty of walleyes. There is also a bay north of the narrows area that held alot of fish. I'm not sure if this helps, but good luck."
