1115622,IMWalleye,2009-06-22 17:34:00,35,"I was there May 31 - June 9. All the spots were working , especially Chamberlain Narrows and North. It was too early for Wapesi, but I heard that Scaler was worth the trip. Camp was not full. Service, staff, bait, boats/motors were all excellent as usual. The only thing that didn't cooperate was the weather - but the walleye and northern didn't seem to mind. Great numbers - good size (but not as good as last year)."

1116099,Guest,2009-06-24 12:22:00,0,"just got back from Lac Seul Outposts: I was there from June 6-20th. Fishing the first week was great, never had to go more than 5 minutes from camp. Caught walleye up to 30 inches in sight of camp. Weather was cold and wet. Second week caught lots of fish, had to search for them, the weather changed to hot and sunny. The water temp was 52 on the 6th and 72 on the 20th. Found lots of fish in Scaler the second week. Traveled up past birch narrows and down to bear narrows, with about the same slow outcome. Still caught many slot fish, biggest one the second week 28 inches. Plenty of big pike and a few musky."
1116104,Guest,2009-06-24 12:47:00,0,"Sounds like a great trip...and two weeks of fishing? Impressive. When you were at Scaler, were you cathing them at the falls, or out in the main lake? We've only fished the falls area, and wouldn't even know where else to try. We leave Tuesday, and can't wait."
1116383,Guest,2009-06-25 11:57:00,0,"WE caught them in the falls. The first day it was loaded, could not get your minnow to bottom, each day slowed up, with less fish caught, still some nice ones in with the bunch, mostly 25 inches biggest 28 inches"
