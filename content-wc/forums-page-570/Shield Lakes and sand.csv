The northern guys pound these areas if there are weeds nearby, but I've not noticed the walleye guys spending any time near them. Not even the transition areas. We fish mud to rock transitions, but ignore the sand to rock or sand to mud. Am I missing an opportunity here? I've fished lac Seul and the group I went with fished areas that looked and felt like sand with some structure close by and did well. In general there didn't seem to be a lot of ""rocky"" feeling spots in that area of the lake. Pooch"

I think the walleyes go to these ares right after spawn and wait for the perch to spawn. Best water temps for the sands is 55-70 degrees. Then as the summer goes along I think the walleyes switch to more rocky areas then. I,m going up tomorrow, I'll let you know how I did."
