I've been north of Red Lake ON. is there that much of a difference in June and July? I won't have a date locked down till this years fishermen get back and rebook, also any reports from the area would be appreciated. I'm not making a trip this year and its killing me. I've been keeping an eye on all the reports, keep them coming. Canadian fishing gets in your blood it's hard to explain but I read this message board almost daily all year. Thanks for all the info and stories, counting down the days till next summer."
