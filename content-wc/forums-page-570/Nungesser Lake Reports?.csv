1113429,Ralfeee,2009-06-14 08:56:00,33,"Thank you for the update. We go every other year, and the camp changed owners last year. They were running the camp in 2007 and seemed really nice. Glad to hear you had a some success. I hope the weather is nice for our trip."

It was cold wet and snowy, walleyes were slow at first but improved later in the week.Pike were good all week on deadbait very few on lures.For walleye jig&minnow was by far the best bet. Fish wind blown points and islands 8 to 10 ft. For pike fish mouths of bays and the creek mouths deadbait was the ticket fished on a slip bobber on the bottom. I was there 5/30 to 6/4 hope this helps."
1115133,Baitslinger,2009-06-20 09:19:00,93,"How were water levels? Seems to be much talk of high water all over canada.Any reports on pike? I'm hoping to spend a little time chasing an esox or two when we are up there in next week. My old standby has always been a gold or copper colored Little Cleo, but I'd be interested to hear any other favorites, especially those that have been proven on Nungesser."

1116777,Ralfeee,2009-06-27 08:32:00,33,"Just returned and the water is still high. The fishing was great, and the fish were still shallow. The shinners had started their run and caught fish on Swimbaits and anything Gulp. Early in the week the fish wanted a slow presentation, and as the week progressed the fish started hitting swimming baits. Had a great time and the new owners of NLL and their staff were great."
