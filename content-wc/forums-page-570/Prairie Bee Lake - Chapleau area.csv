The fishing location that I described to you is near the main camp .. are you staying there or at the outpost? If you want, you can email me at [email protected] for a few additional details. Good luck!"

Another hot spot you might try is the opening to the grassy river straight south of camp. At dusk works the best with top water lures for your northern pike fix. Don' be afraid to go back into the river a couple hundred yards or so!!!"

We have had more success with the color orange than any other color. I use orange jigs or jigs with green and orange. Most of the plugs i use have orange in them. Fish all points heavy especially those that lead to deep water. In the evening, look for flats that lead to deep water. There is a lake called Sawtooth just up from your cabin. You have to carry your boat a short distance but the fishing is great."
1115455,EyeBanger,2009-06-22 06:26:00,23,I have heard that there are a good number of pike in Sawtooth. Are there any walleye in there?

Any suggestions on lures/technique or possible hot spots on the lake would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance, Leo"

A good starting place for you is the marker bouy about a mile south of the main camp. It marks a rock structure that is just below the surface, and there are lots of drop-offs and reefs surrounding the marker. We use mainly 1/4 oz jigs with plastic tails, tipped with half of a crawler. Explore, you'll find many other good spots ... the prime locations seem to change every year. Tom, the owner, will be glad to tell you what has been working recently."

They have been unresponsive to emailed questions after receiving payment. It was probably just a coincidence or a symptom of having limited internet access. Nonetheless, it made us first-time visitors somewhat nervous about the place. Looking forward to our trip. Thanks again!"
