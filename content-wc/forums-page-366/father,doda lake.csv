The problem was the outfitter , we had no gas for the boats the first 2 days and indians had been in our camp and left a terrible mess. The caretaker was a great guy , but only had so much control over getting supplies . The fishing was great, we caught some huge pike along with some 1o lb. lakers.But beware of the outfitters."
