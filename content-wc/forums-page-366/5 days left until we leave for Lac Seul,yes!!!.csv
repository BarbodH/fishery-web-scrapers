This year I'm going to pull minnow baits on 3 ways for walleyes and big Northerns.All the bigger northerns we caught last year were out on the deeper rock structure the walleyes were using.I have a good assortment of Rapala minnows,Thundersticks,Rogues and Bomber long A's for this."

What camp will you be at?Bill, since you will still be there that week, we will watch for you, your Wife and two dogs. You should be easy to spot if we end up fishing the same area."
