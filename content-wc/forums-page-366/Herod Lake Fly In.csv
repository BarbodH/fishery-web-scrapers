Please comment if you have any experience with this trip. If you would like to email me at [email protected] or comment on WC. Thanks, Mike Kansas"

I have fished Larus Lake 13 times and Clear Lake 3 times. The fishing is nothing short of outstanding, and (especially on Larus) the cabins are clean and functioning, with all the amenities you would need for a week at an outpost.The new beach cabin on Larus is an absolute gem, almost too nice for an outpost cabin located along a sandy beach.Again, I have no personal experience with Herod Lake, but I can vouch for Dave and Michelle, their planes, and their outposts, over and over. The only downside is the fact that the flights to these lakes do take 90 minutes +."
