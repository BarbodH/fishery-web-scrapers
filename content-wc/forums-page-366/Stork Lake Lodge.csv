I've been fishing Canada for some 40 years now, mostly of those years were spent on Pakwash at Pakuni Lodge. In fact, I was one of the first customers when Richie Mckyintire opened it. He offered trips to Longlegged Lake and I went there a couple times and never forgot about it. Recently I've been doing a little research on Stork Lake Lodge on the Longlegged chain and have read a few things that concern me such as: Road conditions, parking facilities, access to the lake during low water, and general attitude of the staff. It's expensive, that I know, but I know how the fishing is, and am willing to pay the dollars. Some of the other things have got me wondering though. Any first hand information anyone can give me, please do, I'd appreciate it. Anyone looking for information on fishing the south end of Pakwash, drop me a line. Like I said, I've fished the lake quite a bit and have a few spots and secrets I can share."
