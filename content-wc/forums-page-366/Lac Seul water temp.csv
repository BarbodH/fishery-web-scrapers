1954010,Skywagon,2013-07-16 09:38:00,1106,"Flew up to Archer lake (connected to east central Lac Seul) on Saturday for the day, fishing was below average for us (it had just rained 1 1/2 inches a few hours earlier) water temps were around 73 according to my HDS 5. Supposed to get to 86 today, one of the warmer days so far, just turned on the AC. Deer flies are terrible right now when you are on land, they should let up in a couple of weeks."
1954690,BenBeattie,2013-07-16 13:15:00,232,"73 is probably close to average surface temps right now. It's been hot lately, and I've seen temps over 80 in more than one bay."
1973233,scgibby11,2013-07-22 21:41:00,109,last week near EAr Falls temps were as low as 69 in the mornings in deep water after a rain and as high as 73 commonly at the end of hot days
1975266,BenBeattie,2013-07-23 12:41:00,232,"Yesterday main lake temps were at 69 degrees. We've had cooler weather, with lows in the 50's overnight recently."
