1964169,Guest,2013-07-19 12:56:00,0,Leaving for Canada in the am. Someone just told me there was construction around Virginia and there was quite a slow down. Anyone been through recently that can tell me what is going on? Thanks in advance.

1964257,Aaron-IN,2013-07-19 13:13:00,500,I've been through there and back twice in the past month and I didn't experience any slowdowns.
1964417,Guest,2013-07-19 13:37:00,0,"According to the MN Dept of Highways and looking at a map, the area looks like it could be about 10 miles long. Just take it easy thru there and then you look back and wonder what you were worried about."
1964441,tv4fish,2013-07-19 13:49:00,2694,"If any of you guys using that route want to ""plan ahead"" - you need to be aware of this ""little"" change that is coming. I couldn't believe that MN/DOT got into this mess!!http://www.dot.state.mn.us/d1/projects/hwy53relocation/"

Like other post said shouldn't be too much of a slow down. Ignore the post about the relocation of HWY 53 near Virginia, that is just in the planning stages & won't be happening for a year or more! Safe travels & happy fishing! Only 7 days to go for our return trip to Lac Seul! Can't wait!!! RBF"

1965593,cuamb,2013-07-19 19:26:00,203,Went through today on way home from Lac Seul. Traffic was 55 mph with a couple of stops. Not very bad at all. My GPS says I lost 3 minutes.
