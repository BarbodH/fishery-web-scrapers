1876746,fishnutbob,2013-06-18 07:49:00,633,I like mashed Potato's and gravy
1880241,Simple Man,2013-06-19 10:50:00,92,"I agree.....if you don't want to discuss the issue or help the original poster then don't open the friggin post to begin with.....the guy is just trying to use this forum to get some info for his trip. If you are not interested in the thread then go away and post to another one that is solely about fishing. Personally, for my group I am interested in this thread because where we are going and the time we cross the border does not allow us to buy potato's on the Canadian side. If you want to eat peanut butter all week on your trip have at it.......I personally enjoy taters with our fish fry!"
1883561,bigwalleye1,2013-06-20 11:47:00,2632,"You guys do realize, don't you, that this thread is over 3 years old and the thing was revived by a ""guest"". Not to turn it into another ""nuke the guest"" thing, but seems like it was revived to get a rise out of someone."
1912306,Guest,2013-07-01 11:01:00,0,"Rest assured I did not post a comment to ""get a rise"" out of someone. Just wanted to see what the rules & regulations were regarding what can / can not be brought into Canada."
1914978,Skyraptor,2013-07-02 08:02:00,291,Typical response from a FIB!
1972785,Guest,2013-07-22 19:45:00,0,"Hard to take any comments serious when the name of the poster is ""Skyraptor""."
1207520,TerryL,2010-06-06 11:26:00,1,"Taters and other food items were not questioned for 3 trucks pulling boats, heading to Minaki for 13 days. We entered 5/14/10. Entry port was Emerson Manitoba. They just asked the usual stuff about guns, knives, pepper spray, alcohol & tobacco."
1207671,Guest,2010-06-06 22:24:00,0,BELIVE IT OR NOT WE SELL POTATOS IN CANADA who would of thought SOMEONE WOULD GO TO THAT MUCH TROUBLE FINDING OUT ABOUT TATERS gIANT tIGER 15LB BAG 3.99 CND IF YOUR WORRIED ABOUT PRICE
1207882,nicko,2010-06-07 17:42:00,508,"Like I said.......Ya gotta laugh....at that price, id be buying them up there and taking them home!!!!! All to save $.50 cents.....it's hilarious what some people do....."
1207910,BB3,2010-06-07 18:54:00,48,Some people cross at night with nowhere to buy them before they get to their camp. So...
1868041,Guest,2013-06-15 08:33:00,0,Overall the prices of food in Ontario is quite high as compared to the states. Our group does the housekeeping plan so as to cut down on costs. Buying groceries in the US allows us to save money and offers us far greater choices than would be the case buying in Kenora or Dryden.
1868145,jimmie,2013-06-15 09:26:00,123,Exactamondo!!!!!
1868577,MorganMan,2013-06-15 16:19:00,341,"Ya, I don't think it's about the money. It's about the annoyance of having to make ANOTHER stop for those who make really long trips already. It's about the annoyance of having everything neatly and strategically packed for a fly-in and then having to pass along a bag of potatoes to load the plane. Why would you click on a topic and take the time respond if you are just going to whine about it? Print yourself a nice little certificate for fishing the longest! lol"
1868737,AMPHIB206,2013-06-15 18:33:00,191,"Kill 2 birds with one stone. Bring your own potatoes across the border and make your own potato brew, potato vodka, potato beer, sweet potato brew. Potato guns will be confiscated at the border, unless the clip can hold less than five rounds of russets. I yam impressed with all the spud humour. Keep your 'eyes peeled' on Hwy 502 for moose. It'll make a nice stew. And bring your own gravy for your fries!"
1868833,Guest,2013-06-15 19:22:00,0,"You gotta laugh in a different thread here the Americans are stating how important the dollars they spend in Ontario should be appreciated more by us Ontario folks, and here we see the truth about how EVERYTHING POSSIBLE is bought in USA and brought over, even down to $3.00 worth of potatoes.....and worried about bringing worms, ....maybe you should pack your gas and water in too !!!!"
1876042,zeebee,2013-06-17 21:34:00,1144,"Not another us /them thread. Im a Canadian and I buy in my city before heading out. It is far more convenient, less expensive and I don't have to be concerned about limited selection. Id do the same if I resided in a US city."
1199899,Moondog,2010-05-12 21:54:00,362,"I think taters are important. Now here is something MORE important...........I bought 20 dozen worms at Walmart marked Canadian Nightcrawlers ........packed in Canadian peat. So howcum I gotta put them in Buss Bedding, a dirt free bedding so I can bring them into Canada? The dirt is Canadian, comes to the USA but then is BAD??? come on. I am taking taters."
1200113,Mike Kansas,2010-05-13 12:40:00,1463,"OK...I agree the Potatoe thing has been overdone or (baked to long). Now what about a really important item ?????? HOW MUCH BOOZE CAN I BRING. Lets talk about the staples of life!!! Lets face it how many of us come back to camp after a full day of catching fish and say ""Man I could really use a good Potatoe"" Nobody in our group....give us a bottle some ice a tall glass your favorite mix and the potatoe thing comes much later. Mike Kansas"
1200125,WallerChief,2010-05-13 12:54:00,83,1 Case of Beer per person or 1 - 40 oz. bottle of liquor.Does anyone know how much the duty is for each additional case? I'm thinking it's still cheaper to go that route than to buy it in CA.
1200130,SimilarIsland,2010-05-13 12:59:00,121,"It's about $10, depending on how much the beer is."

1200282,nitroman,2010-05-13 20:43:00,368,So.......... If I bring Potato wine does it count against not only my booze ration but my tater ration as well. Think about it you can get your drink on as well as fill your desire for some taters with your evening meal. Spud gun loaded with a nice perch would be an exciting way to feed those eagles watching me fish........ hmmmm or take out the pesky gulls that steal the perch from him....... 7 and a wake up yahoo!
1200308,Moondog,2010-05-13 22:00:00,362,"Ok..........pass the PO-ta-TOES and give me a $3 dollar brew......Lakeside is good. Er, so is Blue and WILDCAT!!! Getting excited...... Leaving Sunday......takes 4 days from here in our moho."
1200360,JDP,2010-05-14 06:52:00,1457,Where are you going in Canada?
1200409,Moondog,2010-05-14 09:55:00,362,We are headed up to Gull Rock and staying at South Bay. Should be there by the 19th.
1200431,muskyhunter34,2010-05-14 10:24:00,227,"Can't We All Just Get Along? chill pill for everybody...enjoy life!I really miss Canada...will go soon...love, muskyhunter34"
1199577,nicko,2010-05-12 10:02:00,508,"Nothing downgrading in my post. I think this site is hilarious. I mean come on potatoes? Look at the number of posts on potatoes in canada? lets hear about resorts, conditions, methods, experiences, weather effects, places to see and what to do. I never saw so many posts on potatoes and DUI and felonies..... I gotta laugh....You guys are a riot.....Now back to Fishing...."
1199585,KTroller,2010-05-12 10:20:00,237,"How about fishing WITH potatoes? I carve shallow diving crankbaits out of russets, reds and yukon golds. The yukon golds far and away outfish the other two. This year I might try sweet potatoes, I'm thinking of trolling them behind mini planer boards which I've fashioned our of russets. On a serious note, which ones do you all prefer for potato guns?"
1199586,Mark R,2010-05-12 10:23:00,1538,I don't think there is to much info on what you can an can't cross the border with on this site. If there is info available lets share it. BTW I need some GPS coordinates on your best FISHING spots on Lac Suel.
1199592,JayM5209,2010-05-12 10:34:00,1050,"I don't have a spud gun, but I've been thinking about bottom bouncing with a crinkle cut french fry on 10# flouro with a gold #4 Colorado blade and four red beads. I'm just thinking it might out catch a Slow Death rigged crawler."
1199602,KTroller,2010-05-12 10:44:00,237,I won't give you GPS spots for Lac Seul but I will give you a hint - My Navionics chip thinks the spot is on dry land. Another favorite spot is located by a group of potato shaped islands.If it's choppy the crinkle cut fry should work but use a scallop potato instead of the colorado blade.
1199609,nicko,2010-05-12 10:51:00,508,"Now we are talking!!!! Personally, I like steak fries from some nice Russets!! BTW...I'll be at LOTW last week of June/July. Looking for any tips on patterns for the Sioux Narrows/Nestor falls area. Anyone have any spots they target for eyes and smallies? Might try my hand at deep jigging for lakers. Any spots to hit would be welcome....."
1199631,camp chef,2010-05-12 11:52:00,915,We used to stop in Nestor falls to buy our Potatoes
1199642,nicko,2010-05-12 12:33:00,508,"HA! Now that's funny.....Here's an interesting observation though...I've noticed that most of the people at our camp whether they eat at the lodge or they eat on their own spend a lot of time eating. Me personally, I fished from 7am until almost 11pm for 5 days straight with an hour break for lunch and dinner. Maybe fishing more would result in a healthier lifestyle?"
1199666,camp chef,2010-05-12 13:29:00,915,"To each their own..,That's what is cool about vacationing in the bush.We fish the Winnipeg River at Minaki in the spring and are usually on the water by 8 a.m. and by 4p.m. we have caught all the fish we care to for the day.Many times in excess of 100 for the two of us. Then it is time for camp chores...i.e. ****tail hour,a few games of Gin and a nice Dinner.There was a day when we would go back out and fish for a few more hours however the last few years seem to find us on the veranda watching the wildlife and telling stories over a few cold ones before bed. Enjoy what ever you enjoy. Bryon"
1199883,bpetersen,2010-05-12 21:10:00,251,"Very well put. If not interested, don't read the thread."
1199508,JDP,2010-05-12 07:22:00,1457,"I emailed CIFA (Canadian Food Inspection Agency) asking the question regarding bringing potatoes into Canada from Minnesota. Before I bring potatoes into Canada I would like to read from the Canadian government that all is clear. The language on the site in my opinion is very ""legalize"". I am fairly certain that at a minimum the wheels are in motion to change the rule but not 100% sure all is clear. Perhaps a ""great legal mind"" can read the CIFA information and clarify.Below is the response:Please review the import requirements for specific products using the CFIA's Automated Import Reference System at: http://airs-sari.inspection.gc.ca/ By following the appropriate prompts, you will be able to determine current requirements based on the type of product / size of shipment you intend to import.Should you have any additional questions, you can contact the CFIA's National Import Service Centre using the contact information found at: http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/imp/importe.shtmlThank you for using the CFIA website."
1199521,Outfitter17,2010-05-12 07:48:00,127,"This year you can bring 10lbs of potatoes per person accross the border, they need to be in original packaging, plastic, etc."
1199523,JDP,2010-05-12 07:52:00,1457,"I believe you (regarding 10lbs) but where is this information communicated?By the way is 10 lbs per person? Per vehicle? Per group/party?I need to be sure as others in my group would be carrying potatoes as well as me. I do not want to put them in harms way and waste potatoes (dumping at the border).I don't like to be difficult but I need to be sure my group abides by the rule, or we will simply purchase potatoes in Canada as we have in the past.Thanks Much!"
1199541,JayM5209,2010-05-12 09:10:00,1050,"JDP, you can get all the details and lots of reading right here - http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/...d-96-05e.shtmlExcerpts below:2.2 Import Requirements for the continental U.S.2.2.1 General To further enhance the capability for trace-back of identified problems, and to ensure that potatoes are properly regulated according to the phytosanitary status of the area where the potatoes were grown, certification of the state of origin is mandatory for all potatoes from all U.S. states. The certification of the state of origin is the responsibility of the USDA and the statement of origin must appear on official USDA documents.Exceptions: The import of 4.0 kg (10 lbs) or less per conveyance of packaged potatoes for human consumption is permitted when commercially packaged and labelled as meeting U.S. no.1 grade. The certification of state of origin is not required and no other import requirements apply. (Bold emphasis added)Also note 1.5 Commodities Exempt Processed and frozen potatoes are not regulated (e.g. frozen French fries, canned potatoes, potato chips, potato flakes, potato starch). _____________________________________As noted in an earlier thread on this topic, the potatoes must be commercially packaged. Also, the phrase ""4.0 kg (10 lbs) or less per conveyance"" implies to me the meaning ""10lb./vehicle,"" not ""10lb./person.""Outfitter17, can you provide any additional clarification on the per person/per vehicle issue?"
1199545,nicko,2010-05-12 09:19:00,508,"What i'd really like to see on this site is more information on Fishing. My God....Potatoes? Please!! How many times has this come up? If you figured it out, the few cents you save isn't worth it. How many potatoes do you eat in a week? 60lb's? What are you saving? I mean really saving? $2.00? $5.00? what percentage of the trip is that? Let's do some simple math.... Trip costs $2000 usd Potatoes cost savings $5.00 Percentage of trip .25% Your worried about .25%? You blew the $5 bucks in gas carrying all that extra weight 500 miles. You want to save $$$. Take less stuff, eat less, enjoy Canada for what it is. A beautiful wilderness that is tranquil and allows us to enjoy the outdoors. To me, i'd eat peanut butter and jelly for a week just to get out of the rate race I live in all day long. The End!!!!"

1199559,JayM5209,2010-05-12 09:40:00,1050,"Yes, and now let's just go fishing!My thought, perhaps a bit naive, was that by doing a little quick research and posting the link to the original, official documentation, people who still have questions, after all the threads we've seen on the subject, could just go find the answers they need.Heck, we never even take potatoes to Canada. A bag of rice, a box of instant au gratins for a change, maybe a box of pasta. A week in Canada is always a relieving break from the excesses of a meat and potatoes diet!Maybe the link I provided in my earlier post should be put in a Sticky at the top of the Canada board!?!?!?!"
1199561,bob oh,2010-05-12 09:44:00,3936,How about if you're not interested in the topic you not read it. After all it was pretty clear what the thread was about. Chill out and post something about fishing.
1199571,JDP,2010-05-12 09:51:00,1457,There is no need to downgrade others that are merely trying to finally find a resolution to a question or concern and comply with the laws.Thanks Jaym5209 for the information.
