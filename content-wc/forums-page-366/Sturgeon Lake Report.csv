It took a little searching as the fish haven't really headed to their summer humps yet . The Northeast Arm never lets you down and it was very good fishing with most fish caught in about 5 ft of water. We spent another day around Coveney Island and that was lights out , but again most fish caught in less than 8 ft of water. My 2 daughters caught over 50 Walleyes there in about an hour. We picked up some nice Northerns there too. The Lakers were very predictable and were fairly shallow at 45-60 ft. Weather was good , bugs were the worst ever."

1968809,iman63,2013-07-21 13:46:00,91,Catman what size walleyes were you catching behind Coveney? We were there last week of June and caught more walleyes than northerns there. All eyes were small though. Normally that is one of our favorite spots for northerns but Nipicon was our best spot for all fish this year.

I ve never checked out the cabin , but someday I will. No real big Northerns , but a couple upper 30s. The back of Black Bay was also real good to us. I usually dont have to travel to the Northeast Arm , but this year it seemed like that's where the fish were."
