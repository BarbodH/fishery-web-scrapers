We have several ""rookies"" with us so I am thinking something that offers quantity over quality with easy fishing would be best. We tried a tougher lake to fish this past year in MN and needless to say, some didn't leave too happy. Looking at the first or second week in June next year. I have been talking with Little Canada Camp on the English River system, sounds reasonable and from what I have heard fishing is phenomenal around that time of year. Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated!"
