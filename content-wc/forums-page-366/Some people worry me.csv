1963129,NickDalasio,2013-07-19 07:12:00,34,"Well done Johnboat. I'd like to think that most of us would have done the same thing.Actually, I'm surprised that most camps/outfitters don't give any information to new customers about what to bring/do in the case that you do get lost. Most seem to assume that the guests all know how to operate a boat & are good outdoorsmen.I'm not ashamed to admit that I have been in almost the same situation as the ""golfer"", thankfully I was able to get my bearings and find my way back in the dark, but it's an uncomfortable feeling none the less. I make sure now to carry 2 flashlights, lots of batteries, a dry copy of the lake map, a lighter, and some dry TP in case I need to start a fire, bug spray, and a Thermacell with refills...I don't worry so much about being found or starving, my biggest concern is spending the night outside with the mosquitoes. It's not only about getting lost, equipment failure can leave you stranded also.If I do plan to fish until dark, I make it a point to work my way back to a familiar spot close to camp long before the sun goes down.I finally got with the times & bought a handheld GPS, still learning how to use it."
1963865,johnboat,2013-07-19 11:14:00,2014,"tly, Wow. Quite a story. I was trying to imagine what would be worse than getting lost on a big body of water late at night with no gear. I think your story just answered it!"
1966961,grizzley,2013-07-20 12:28:00,2518,"SOME! HA-a lot of people worry me!!!!Watched a guy launch a boat in the Delaware River, where there were boats anchored all over the place for the Shad contest.His engine wouldn't start, and as he drifted downriver some guys had to push him away from their boats with oars, hands, or whatever. He was pretty well downriver when he finally got the motor started, moved up to a spot, and then dropped anchor. ??????A few years back we noticed some hollering, and figured it was just a group of canoes or yacks coming down the river. It kept up and when we turned around we noticed a empty boat floating towards us and two guys upriver on the shore.Two of the park rangers were doing some work on one of the islands, and their boat broke loose! We pulled anchor, got their boat, and took it back to them. Then there was the incident when a canoe washed over a boulder and dumped 2 older people in the river, and the canoe plus some of the gear was going downriver. We got the canoe and the people, while another boat got their gear. Never a dull moment on the river!!!!Also the guy I saw at the local lake, that unhooked everything and managed to launch the boat in the middle of the concrete ramp!!!!"
1947593,Gunner_Fletch,2013-07-14 07:05:00,74,"Such a familiar story. Being a guide on LOTW, I myself have given the odd helpful advice and sometimes physically escorted unwary boaters/fishermen back to familiar waters. I do this mostly because I couldn't live with myself if I hear on the news the next day that they are either missing or worst yet ...killed! Enough people die on this lake every year, and to be quite honest....it's mostly due to they're own stupidity. Yes, I said it...stupidity. Common sense is not so common these days! Be prepared and set your silly pride aside for a moment and don't bite off more than you can chew. I spent 27 years in the Canadian Army and I can tell you that one of the many things it instilled in me is, being prepared. Fail to plan....plan to fail! Hey...here's a concept to chew on. Here in Canada (not sure if the Americans have this), we have a qualification requirement called a boaters licence. It is a fairly recent course....within the last 6 years I believe, and to be quite honest in my opinion---it's an absolute joke. Passing this test and acquiring your pleasure craft operators license gives the average inexperienced boater just enough information to be dangerous! Tell you what...let this army veteran design this course and you would see at least 2 full days of map/compass/orienteering theory, followed by practical exercises on the water. With NO GPS! There...I'm done! Need another coffee."
1947657,Common Man,2013-07-14 07:21:00,192,"Towed a guy named Chuck in on Leech Lake the other day. He got out to Pelican Island and after fishing for a couple of hours he couldn't get his boat started due to a low battery. He said he knew his battery was suspect because his autobilge had been stuck on for a couple of days. When I dropped him off at the dock he asked what he owed me and I told him just some common sense. Between the lack of common sense and no consideration for other people, it's becoming a very strange world."
1948417,bellbuoy,2013-07-14 14:03:00,490,You win the Good Samaritan Award. It's amazing how people are just so arrogant. I think the wife should have given you the $50!
1948561,SinOrSwim,2013-07-14 15:32:00,1528,"Always nice to help someone and then mock the crap out of them. Maybe it's me but the arrogance seems to be in many of the posters in this thread. Sure, the guy didn't know what he was doing but he was polite and asking for help. Then, to be judged because of his ""golf attire"". I have a houseboat docked in our local marina. One of the things I love about the boating world, is you don't have a class system. I have no idea if the people on my dock make 40K or 400K/year. If we have a newbie, people help them. But, they don't go back to their own boat and mock the lack of their ability. We have all been there at one time or another."
1949377,zeebee,2013-07-14 20:52:00,1144,"Yup this needed to be said too. Little humbleness might seep in if we all reflect on the ""one or two"" dumb things some of us have encountered in our own life. The OP helped out and that's really the main point to this thread."
1950234,lassh,2013-07-15 09:31:00,553,Well done.
1952810,johnboat,2013-07-15 21:56:00,2014,"You are right, it is you. I wasn't mocking anybody. I wasn't judging them either. I mentioned his attire because that is not usually what you see most fisherman wear in the North woods. I would have been more than happy to help them if they were wearing anything from full goretex from head to toe or a clown suit complete with the big floppy shoes. My intent with this thread was to have us that are ""in the know"" about big dangerous waters to let the green horns know what dangers may lie ahead and that ""The Lady Of The Lake"" is to be respected. Now if I could get ""The Lady Of The Fairway"" to be a little more generous, maybe my golf game would get a little better. It's been struggling a bit as of late."
1954434,Blackmacs,2013-07-16 11:41:00,2121,Hey when the guy looks like this you just have to mock them.
1954706,Gregking,2013-07-16 13:16:00,2658,"Not really sure it was judging him as much as profiling him. A lot of indications that he may need to be escorted back to their camp. I would have done the same thing. Today's society we are so sensitive. I didn't see much arrogance there at all, someone could have just told them where they were and kept fishing. A don't bother me I'm fishing attitude."
1957890,tly,2013-07-17 13:04:00,1900,"Early one morning a few years ago it had just turned light and I was drift fishing the river mouth near the entrance to Scaler Lake when a small plane circled once, landed and taxi'd over to me. I thought it maybe the MNR doing a license check. It was an old Piper J3 with two older gentlemen, not the MNR. The said they were low on fuel and attempting to find Sioux Lookout, could I tell them how to get there! My response was to point out the general direction or just wait 1/2 hour and the sky will be loaded with outbound fly in aircraft, just go toward where they came from. Never did figure out where they came from or what they were doing that early."
1944681,johnboat,2013-07-12 15:30:00,2014,"Last week I was at LOTW staying ay Mylie's Place. My nephew and I went out for an evening fish for a few hours. About 9;30 - 10:00ish we see a camp boat. They see us and make a bee line to us, right up to the boat and shut her down. ""Gentlemen"" the man says, ""We could use a little help"" I ask him what we could do. Long story short......He and his wife are lost. He asked if I knew where Haystack Island was. Told him I have never heard of it. He told me they were staying at Black Bear Lodge. I told him I have never heard of that either. He asked what island we were fishing by, I told him. He gets out his map and cant find it. Finally finds it. He says ""looks like I have to go this way"". I say ""no, you need to go the opposite direction"" He says ""nope, this way' - I repeat ""no, that way' He is polite about it but disagrees again. I slightly question my self and look at my premium lake master chip on my GPS. I finally say, ""sir, who's lost? Me or you?' His wife , who is petrified, says ""honey, listen to him"" It turns out it is Hay Island he is looking for and Black Duck Resort. ( wow) He assures me he can make it back. I look him over in his golf attire as well as his wife. ""It's our first day out"" she says. I start folding up my map and the wife gives me that"" Please God, don't leave us look"" I say follow me and stay in the wake, I will lead you in. We got them back, about nine miles, in almost complete darkness. He was appreciative and handed me a 50 an said "" Thank you , have some cigars on me."" She gives me a hug and said"" we were actually looking for a place to camp when we saw you"" That night a severe thunder storm, lightning and rain fell through the night. The next day the MNR is out in helicopters probably checking for fires from lightning, My nephew asked"" what are they looking for?"" My response, Well, it isn't that nice couple we lead home last night"" They had no water, no rain gear, no bug spray........................... It is surprising to me how some folks go out on the water so unprepared. John B.O.A.T."
1944713,Gregking,2013-07-12 15:43:00,2658,"I'm guessing from the lack of preparation, no map, miss pronounced name of bay, island, resort and their attire that this might have been their first experience in a boat. This type of situation is why laws are made. I don't go wonder around in mountains of Montana with a crock screw for a reason. That was very nice to escort them back. You know they wouldn't have made it"
1944793,pikeman14,2013-07-12 16:31:00,144,Wow!!You did the right thing by leading them back....or maybe the camp owners plan backfired.
1944961,wallydave,2013-07-12 18:00:00,2151,"Johnboat you can be very proud of your actions! You may have saved their lives! Its true some folks don't understand how dangerous it can be if you don't take safety seriously. This strikes home with me, this year I took my wife to Lac Seul, it was just the two of us so I took our safety very serious! Thanks for stepping up!"
1945065,v-bay gord,2013-07-12 18:47:00,3168,Good on you for going the extra mile. Actions speak louder than words.
1945105,Dipstick,2013-07-12 19:14:00,101,"Over the years I have been approached by more than a few lost boaters on LOTW, especially Sabaskong area. They were all quickly turned around by the many islands and channels. Most were out on their first day in camp and didn't take a map or didn't look at their map as cruised along. Most don't think of taking a compass. Several only had a partial name for their camp. Several were out with friends in another boat, and of course that boat had the map and they got separated. I now go prepared for meeting lost boaters. I picked up a stack of Sunset Country brochures at the boat show in the winter. These have a pretty good map and a list of camps. These I give out to lost boaters. I am prepared to call their camp on my cell phone and inform where their lost guests are and the route they are going to follow. Most boaters now carry a smart phone. There are plenty of apps that may not show the minor islands, but will show you the major ones and the direction you are going. You can search for your camp number and call them with your problem. I also have the OPP and Coast Guard in Kenora phone numbers in my contact list on my phone. Camp guests should add their camp number to their contact list on their phones. A good hand-held GPS would solve their problems. They are inexpensive and serve several other purposes such as storing wpts and fishing spots. I carry one as a back-up to my Sonar/GPS combo. Needless to say I have a binder of maps and a compass in the boat. Putting all that together is a hobby.Boater safety should be part of the planning for the trip. Adds to the fun in planning during the long winter months.Tight Lines"
1945257,zeebee,2013-07-12 20:38:00,1144,Old school here I guess. I have a GPS and like it to mark spots but still pull out a compass and map to get my bearings. In 40 years it has yet to fail me and needs no batteries.
1945297,rnnonmt,2013-07-12 20:47:00,992,"Awesome Johnboat. There are plenty of things that can go wrong especially for inexperienced boaters. You are a stand-up guy for helping them. I am sure that most would do the same however, now you should have some good karma coming your way. Thanks for sharing!"
1945817,Paul H,2013-07-13 08:03:00,1232,"All the GPS, maps and compass won't fix stupid.Some of the best advice I ever got was from being a Boy Scout and feroicious reading as a kid. Be Prepared - these 2 words could prevent 99% of the issues.Here in Ohio - 14-15 days of rain and then one day or 2 of 1"" to 2"" and flash flooding.#1 - In just a 20 mile radius - 3 guys try to canoe a swollen creek that is now a minor river, water is at the bottom of all the bridges, the 3 guys can't clear the bridge, roll out and almost drown.#2 - Local lake running 11' above summer stage, lots of floating debris, most unseen. Guy in a 12' boat with his Grandson - seat brakes, boat flips, both make it to shore. Make sure your gear is safe. A 12 footer with a DIY seat. has to be unstable to begin with.#3 Local river running WAY high. I would not be on it in less that a 16'+ jet. 3 guys in a 12 footer, yes 3 in a boat probably rated for 3-400 lbs. Flipped it 2 out of 3 survived. Local rescue were very hesitant to even look for him. Quit after 2 days and now waiting for the floater.Stopped at one of the local ramps yesterday - a few trailers in the lot. Noticed one ski boat running at least 35. Lake is fed by a 40 mile river through forest. Lots of unseen floaters. I know of 2 guys that almost flipped, 1 that flipped when hitting debris. I hit a log one year as a fast idle and about crapped myself. This with a 19 foot Lund.When they pass out common sense, there must be a lot that just say ""I'll pass""."
