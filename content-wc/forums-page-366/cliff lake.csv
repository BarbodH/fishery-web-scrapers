I'm pretty sure you won't find lots of big perch on Cliff since its trout water. However, if you go across the road and fish Perrault and Nelson Lake off of Cedar you can catch a bucket full of the rascals."

1965825,Kevin R,2013-07-19 20:56:00,305,"The areas that had weeds were loaded with perch of all sizes even the low growing weeds in 12-20ft had massive schools but they seamed to disappear don't even mark them on my bottom machine. Cliff lake is very clear & large schools of 12""-16"" Walleyes could easily be seen but they seamed to disappear. I remember trying to entice the larger ones into biting by working the bait right in front of them. The Bass were scarce also. Lake Trout were easy to get though."
