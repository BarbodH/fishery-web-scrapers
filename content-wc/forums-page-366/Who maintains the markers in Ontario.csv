Obviously someone sees a need and probably have a financial interest to maintain the ones between Hudson and Chamberlain Narrows. What about Lake Minnitaki, who now steps up to maintain these? As the original post states, one would assume a government agency has that duty, like the Coast Guard, or MNR. In the interest of solving this dilemma; I pay a special fee to use the Sioux area boat launches. That fee has done wonders to improve and maintain these facilities. I have no quibble about that fee and appreciate the hard work that has taken place. If money is the issue, seems to me that adding a couple of bucks to the boat launch fee ought to be a plenty to properly maintain the charted navigational aids in the Sioux Lookout area."
1963073,tv4fish,2013-07-19 06:31:00,2694,Found some interesting facts here - didn't realize how much was/has spent fighting forest fires !!http://www.fin.gov.on.ca/en/budget/f.../ofin12_3.html
1964409,tackleman,2013-07-19 13:36:00,444,"a number of years ago, our federal government was doing some financial belt tightening and one of the items they decided to cut was the budget from the fisheries and oceans department. these are the folks that looked after the markers in ALL Canadian waters. There was a large and vocal outcry that these markers were essential to safety on the water and as usual, it fell on deaf political ears. the marker buoys were to be pulled from all inland waterways unless local solutions could be found.the lake of the woods area formed a group and they conducted an adaopt a buoy program, this helps keep and maintain the buoys in that area.in Red Lake, we have an association that some (definitely not all) pay $25 a year to and this covers our costs for the buoys. in Dryden, no one would pick up the ball and as a result the buoys were pulled from the Wabigoon system. the city of Dryden had been approached by different groups that wanted to form a partnership to maintain the buoys but they were concerned the liability would be too great so they turned down all requests and no partnerships were ever formed. I don't know about Sioux Lookout or the Lac Seul area but it is definitely being looked after by a local group and any support or donation toward the maintenance would probably be greatly appreciated."
1966177,stillangling,2013-07-20 05:21:00,149,"Not all inland waters. As an example, Lake of the Woods and the Winnipeg River in NW Ontario are still maintained and there is no association involved. Paid for and maintained by Canada Coast Guard. They pulled out of everything but the busiest waters. I think that some of the lakes/rivers in southern Ontario like Lake Simcoe and the Trent Severn are still maintained as well."
1951386,tv4fish,2013-07-15 14:38:00,2694,"I have been trying to research this with no luck (tried the MNR site). Who knows what agency or group installs and maintains the navigation markers up on Lac Seul? I guess I'm interested in who is in charge of the red/green buoys that are out in the water, in addition to who installs and maintains the reference markers that are placed on the shore (you know, the slatted white/orange markers that you are supposed to be able to see from one to the other as you boat?"
1951402,hides,2013-07-15 14:41:00,5,"Canadian Coast guard has a boat that maintains the buoys on LOTW and Winnipeg river, I assume they maintain them on Lac Seul as well."
1951426,falkopat,2013-07-15 14:44:00,44,"i know that on the ne section of lac seul the house boat companies maintain them. we saw them this year putting them out because many were lost or moved over the winter. they also have the most to lose with people driving there houseboats up on the rocks. We asked them later that week why they were doing it, and they said the government use to due it but do to cut back they stopped. So they do it to help people not because they have to."
1951530,WalleyeWally28,2013-07-15 15:10:00,298,I've been told that in the NW section the resorts try to maintain them as best they can as the Coast Guard is no longer responsible. Not positive but that's what I've heard.
1951570,tv4fish,2013-07-15 15:31:00,2694,Sorry Guys -- I was/am asking about those in the Sioux Lookout area (NE part of Lac Seul).
1952074,falkopat,2013-07-15 18:30:00,44,from Hudson up to bearnarrows area it is the house boat companies. Not sure who does it above pelican falls
1959385,Full Moon,2013-07-17 20:35:00,9,It is a shame this duty is ignored by some Ontario government agency. It is just a matter of time before someone is found to be in harms way due to this neglience. Shore markers are overgrown and have not been painted in years. I noticed a green buoy missing in Minnitaki. Navigation markers & buoys are as important as road signs. Especially in foul weather. It cannot be that expensive to preform annual maintanece of these navigational aides. I sure hope Onatrio private citizens do not have to start maintaning road signs!
1960009,Aaron-IN,2013-07-18 07:10:00,500,I say the Province of Ontario should just slap a $500/license tax on non-residents so they can fund a program for maintaining the markers on the waters of Ontario.
1960113,Guest,2013-07-18 07:30:00,0,There are a couple of different answers around here. There are private markers that marinas or businesses maintain that mark channels in and out of their facilities. There are navigational markers which the coast guard maintains.
1960713,BenBeattie,2013-07-18 10:19:00,232,"This is hardly a negligence on anyones account. It's not required to mark rocks and routes with marker buoys. Same goes for navigational signs on the lake. What is out there is a convenience to boaters. Consider yourself lucky that the houseboat companies take the time to relocate buoys every spring after the ice drags them off their proper spot. As for the navigational signs on the lake, they're from the days of old when they used to ship freight from Hudson to Ear Falls. If you stray off the main route there are countless unmarked hazards. As an Ontario tax payer I am glad this isn't a 'duty' the government is responsible for. We'd all be broke. When you go boating on a lake it's your responsibility to safely navigate your boat, it's not the responsibility of the Ontario Government. Try fishing in the south central basin section of Lac Seul, there's not a marker or buoy for 50 miles."
