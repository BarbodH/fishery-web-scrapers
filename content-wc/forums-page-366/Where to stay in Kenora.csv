1965817,windriderhog,2013-07-19 20:55:00,61,I'm heading to Lac Suel next week. We usually go thru International Falls but thinking about going up to Winnipeg and staying at Kenora. Looking for suggestions on where to stay and where to get our license and leeches. Thanks

The place is getting a little tired but it is an institution in Kenora. Get a room overlooking the lake. Unlike the super 8, it is within easy walking distance of the good places to eat. In terms of bait and licences, sunset baits is on your way out of town. Good supply and staff that know what they are doing."

1966249,F250,2013-07-20 06:22:00,75,"I have stayed in both places. Yes, the parking lot at the Super 8 has lots of room for a rig pulling a boat, and Casey's Pub has great food and cold beer. The gas station (Husky) across from the Tim Hortons at the south edge of town, has licenses (at least they did last September). The Best Western is a bit more expensive, but the parking is a bit tight. I have stayed there when I was pulling a 14' cargo trailer. They allowed my Chesapeake to stay in my room."
1966585,windriderhog,2013-07-20 09:28:00,61,"Thanks for the suggestions. I am pulling a boat so I'm going to the super 8. We return home from Lac Suel this way but bypass Kenora. Last year stopped to fuel somewhere between Dryden and Kenora at a station that had a huge bait shop with a ton of musky stuff, anyone know if they sell leeches and licenses?"
1966937,Larry S,2013-07-20 12:19:00,665,Super 8 is great. I stayed there last year on my way to Pickle Lake. Be sure to eat at Casey's .
1967265,WalleyeWally28,2013-07-20 14:23:00,298,Sounds like you stopped at Bobby's in Vermillion Bay. Here's the link to the website.http://www.famousbobbys.com/
1967465,zeebee,2013-07-20 16:31:00,1144,Buy your license on line b4 you go and save some timehttp://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...OD_091032.html
1967513,windriderhog,2013-07-20 16:58:00,61,yep... Bobby's is what I was looking for! Thanks guys. I usually buy my license online but can't convince the others to do it. They say we have to stop for bait anyway.
