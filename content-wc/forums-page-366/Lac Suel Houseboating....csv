1948953,houndog,2013-07-14 18:26:00,365,"If not having any neighbors is up your alley and you want to catch respectable numbers of walleys and walleyes with size this may be right for you.I've fished the NE quarter of the lake many times and have used Sioux Lookout Floating lodges as our outfitter.The boats are usually well kept, clean and I haven't had an issue with being stranded. It is best to pay a pilot as this are of the lake has tremendous reefs, rocks and can get very rough...Cost when it's all said and done and including the gas, insurance, ice, license, bait, one nights lodging for the trip up and food is going to push $10k. 9 guys which is really about all you can have on board comfortably and you'll spend $1100 per person.Gas two weeks ago was 1.45 per liter on the road ($5.51/ us gallon) and including tax, we paid almost $8.00 per imperial gallon on the water. This adds up fast especially when your on a loaded houseboat pull 3 fishing boats.Keep in mind you won't have trash pickup, bait availability, water or ice at hand. You have to remember to take everything in with you. You will need more storage and larger vehicles for the trip up.Seclusion isn't what it used to be. There have been many more boats and people than there were even 10 years ago. We haven't landed a 30"" for several years but fishing is still better than most drive to lakes/resorts."
1949129,jimirjr,2013-07-14 19:21:00,1149,"Have You fished it in the ""FALL"" of the year? I mean after the 20th of Sept? We have done HB's before, but on LOW, where there are decent marked shipping lanes.... No problem as the HB's We had all had GPS with great chips in em..... So did the fishing boats We rented... (although, We STILL had a few encounters with sunken reefs and rocks popping up out of nowhere)"
1965657,cuamb,2013-07-19 19:48:00,203,"Mike, I just got back from my second trip this year. With 8 guys we are able to keep it at $1000 per person. This includes HB, gas for trucks (500 miles each way) and boats, bait and food. Each guy is responsible for his own license and beverages."
1943009,falkopat,2013-07-12 06:59:00,44,yeap thats my brothers video he makes every year.
1943105,Iowa Hawkeye,2013-07-12 07:33:00,90,"We usually spend around $!300 per person, based on 8 guys, including a ton of beer and bait. We always get a guide to take the houseboat up and back, no liability for hitting a rock that way. They are really slow, 8mph slow, so like 5 or 6 hours to the Chamberlin area. We use that time to gear up, party, and or nap after driving all night. If you have your own larger horse motors and boat, we take off and get there in no time. Best week of the year, Good Luck"
1943801,Guest,2013-07-12 11:13:00,0,Just got back last weekend from whitewing 7 people our own 3 boats $5700. They anchor up a little north of Windigo pt.
1943977,jimirjr,2013-07-12 12:25:00,1149,Is that relatively close to GOOD fishing areas? Can You move the H.B by Yourself once the pilot leaves?
1944065,Guest,2013-07-12 12:41:00,0,Houseboat stays in one place. Great walleye fishing can be had within 1/4 mile plenty of places within 5 miles. Forgot to add cost of the pilot was $300 round trip.
1944105,SinOrSwim,2013-07-12 12:58:00,1528,I love those videos. It makes me laugh so hard because we have the same stuff on tape. Just never posted on youtube. My favorite are the SWEET dance moves at about the 14:50 mark. Mrs. Steven RUDYYYYYYY. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx7BnjEujCM
1944305,WalleyeWally28,2013-07-12 13:38:00,298,"My Wife and I have stayed at Whitewing for the last 11 years and have toured the houseboats at the dock. They look clean and comfortable. We are also very familiar with the area where they are parked. It is right in the middle of the best fishing in the NW/SW sections of Lac Seul. Easy access to Manitoba Pt, Windigo Pt. Ghost Narrows, McKenzie Bay and the South Basin."
1944609,rinkrat,2013-07-12 14:50:00,1,"rnnonmt, Ido not know how you could possibly have a response to Lac Seul Floating Lodges in this way after rebooking there for 20 years. I have been using their houseboats for 19 years and have had nothing but positive experiences for this duration. Their hospitality has always been greet and their equipment has always been above par. Dave, Irene, Mike, and Andrea do a great job of running this business. Your comments about Mike are incorrect, as you have not taken the time to get to know him. He is a fine young man, all be it a bit shy and soft spoken. We have nad very good experiences with Mike and Andrea is doing a superb job with taking over the business. I just don't understand after doing 20 years of doing your vacation business with these fine people you would comment in this way. Brad"
1945025,jimirjr,2013-07-12 18:38:00,1149,FALKOPAT.... sent You a PM...
1945201,rnnonmt,2013-07-12 20:29:00,992,"Rinkrat, information about Lac Seul house boating was asked for by the OP. I shared brief pros and cons regarding the company we had used for many years. Infact, long before Dave and Irene took over, way back to the days of the old owner who was busted for tax evation. So I can speak from experience as to how we enjoyed year after year of trips until the last couple years where the hospitality degraded. When you are a loyal customer for 20 years (some of the guys in our group 30 years) it is extremely discerning the loyalty was not equally returned. Imagine after all those years of booking with them only the last two years was enough to change our minds. Must have been pretty substantial..... No it wasn't the almighty dollar. Amazing that you have waited two and half years for your first rebuttal."
1935929,jimirjr,2013-07-09 18:38:00,1149,"I have seen a couple places that One can rent a Houseboat for a week on Lac Suel... Anyone done this lately and would like to respond? Location of Home Base, Areas served, Proximity to Twin Cities? Pro's - Cons, etc... cost, amenities..? Thanks ahead............ Jimi"
1936001,Iowa Hawkeye,2013-07-09 19:00:00,90,"Highly recommend Lac Suel Floating lodges out of Hudson. Dave and Irene run a very clean operation. You need to take at least 6 people to make it cost effective, the boats sleep up to 12. Just can't forget anything, satellite phones are your only communication. The worst is keeping minnows alive for 5 or 6 days, but they will deliver anything for extra $, They have a very informative web site. Can't beat staying where you fish. Good Luck"
1936313,Guest,2013-07-09 20:45:00,0,On the west side(south of Ear Falls) the only camp that has house boats is Whitewing resort.http://www.whitewingresort.com/index2.html Drive from twin cities approx 8.5 hrs
1936417,rnnonmt,2013-07-09 22:04:00,992,"I have been house boating from lac seul floating lodges for 20 years. It has been a good experience almost a every year. Dave and Irene are fine owners but their son has a personality that is less than par. We stopped booking with them a few years ago because of the overall hospitality, cost of fuel for The houseboat, mediocre equipment, time to travel to the NE section of Lac Seul and the loss of fishing time. Some of the good points was the remoteness and isolation of not staying at a camp or outpost."
1938465,cuamb,2013-07-10 14:44:00,203,I have been using Sioux Lookout Floating Lodges in Hudson since 98 (sometimes twice a year). Houseboat is a lot less expensive than and a cabin and you are not limited on supplies. I am heaeded up again Friday.Note on keeping minnows alive: We drill holes in 5 gallon buckets (sides and top). We then put a large rock in the bottom and sink the minnows to the bottom of the lake off the back of the houseboat. Just pull them up in the morning and take what you need for the day.
1940625,Mike Kansas,2013-07-11 09:13:00,1463,"For those who have done the houseboat fishing can you give a price range of total cost for a week. I know there are variances but experience should have some figures. Thanks, Mike Kansas"
1941561,falkopat,2013-07-11 13:39:00,44,"our bill for the house boats,bait, gas for houseboat is about 5200.that does not include travle up and back or food.We have 6-8 guys every year and run us 900-1150 a guy all expenses included with travel from milwuakee."
1941601,Mike Kansas,2013-07-11 13:57:00,1463,Thanks for shareing your info. Mike Kansas
1941705,tsquared,2013-07-11 15:03:00,57,"We got the 68' and ran about $7,350 for 7 guys. Included 3 boats, a LOT of gas (as we tend to run more than most), 40 bags of ice and 7 fishing licenses/cards."
