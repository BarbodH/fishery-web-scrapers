1967097,trapperbob,2013-07-20 13:32:00,45,I have fished the chain of lakes just south of there. Lac Berthelot that area. Have had good trips with lots of walleye in the 14- 20 inch range. I believe that lake gets a lot less pressure. There was no outfitter there several years ago. Has had a couple of outfitters running the business past 7-8 years. Get ready for a long drive if coming from the states. We drove up from Pennsylvania. Good luck.

Stayed at the cabin out on the lake ... There is a steep road from the main cabins down to the boat dock ... If you have room I would seriously think about taking a wagon to haul your gear from the cabin to the boat ... There is a few privately owned cabins on the lake ... But they are the only outfitter"
