1972505,BreezyPoint,2013-07-22 18:18:00,1581,I think the whole may fly experience and impact on fishing is vastly overstated. I actually think the may fly hatch is good for fishing as it gets the walleyes in a high test feeding mode. I have been going to Canada since 1965 and have see may flies so thick you couldn't see the water surface and they clogged the impellers on the motor. We still had terrific walleye fishing.

1932993,Bigstorm,2013-07-09 06:38:00,799,"I was wondering the same thing, how long does it normally last? I am heading up just north of Kenora on 7/20. Saw someone mention that they started in that area around 7/3 so I'm hoping its done by the time I get there"
1933001,2746,2013-07-09 06:38:00,3206,I'll be interested in the answer as well....on the one occasion we saw a hatch it lasted only two or three days.
1933209,tv4fish,2013-07-09 07:30:00,2694,"In our experience (NE part of Lac Seul) - we have had to contend with them for 3-4 days some years. Obviously, water temp. and weather has an influence on them."
1933849,2746,2013-07-09 09:33:00,3206,"""One day flies"" come from the fact that the hatched fly only lives for a day. The hatching process of larva on the bottom of the lake hatching into flies is the event that last over a 2 - 4 day period. As I said our one experience was for about three days. Some guys say it can improve fishing as the walleye go on an eating binge......we thought it slowed fishing but we may not have known how to deal with it."
1934609,Bigstorm,2013-07-09 12:11:00,799,"in past years when I have been up there during a hatch in mid June, it did have a big impact on the fish. I fish the English River near Grassy Narrows and the only palce we could find fish consistently was where there was current. If we were on a lake, forget about it. Needed to move to the river between lakes to catch anything. Granted, once we figured that out, we caught a lot"
1935017,Jaskonie,2013-07-09 13:43:00,80,"I love to fish near the hatching areas, white jig and twister, beattle spins, or harnesses work well in matching the hatch. The fish are feeding, yes they wont be feeding on large bait so you have to size it down to what they are looking for."
1935025,kzoofisher,2013-07-09 13:49:00,5144,"Very interesting stuff. On our Michigan trout streams the giant mayfly is the most anticipated couple of weeks of the year and accounts for more ""fish of a liftime"" than any other event. I have heard that it is dreaded by many walleye amd smallmouth fisherma but since I'm always focused on really big trout in June it hasn't been a problem. Headed to Ontario this weekend wioth my son, hope the bugs don't give us any grief. I am going to take a full compliment of flies, just in case."
1936721,CSH Kucinski,2013-07-10 06:02:00,1340,"I was up in Cochrane the 19th through the 23rd and they were all over the place. They were flying, they were on the water, on our hooks and the walleye were even spitting them up in the boat. But I will tell you that it didn't affect the fishing in a negative way at all."
1937609,Carnhzkr,2013-07-10 10:37:00,964,"I fished the NW Bay area of Rainy Lake (Camp Narrows) the week of 6/23. There was a 2-inch carpet of bugs on most of the bays. The gulls were having a feast. I opened one walleye for dinner and there was a golfball sized ball of blackish / brownish crap in his stomach that it took me awhile to identify as mayflies. I'd never been up during the hatch and hope I'm able to avoid it from now on, but I think the timing is more or less a crap shoot."
1914818,NWwalleye,2013-07-02 07:08:00,223,They are out in full force around the Vermilion Bay area ....
1917322,houndog,2013-07-02 17:55:00,365,Started seeing a few them a week ago floating on shallow bays on the western side of gull rock. A few at the cabin. The hatch is probably getting into full swing this week.
1918154,KC Walleye,2013-07-02 22:29:00,274,"Heading up to Lac Seul in a few days. Have never fished In Canada with mayflies causing issues. Any advice? Do people do the best fishing below the surface remnants, or do people usually try to find areas that appear to have little to no mayfly activity? Just curious as I hate to struggle too bad on the Lac, haha. Thanks in advance"
1918626,revitup,2013-07-03 06:28:00,140,"There is a great thread entitled ""winter time discussion-mayflies"" which gives a tremendous amount of good advice on how to fish with mayfly activity."
1918730,tv4fish,2013-07-03 06:53:00,2694,"We were on Lac Seul (NE part out of Sioux Lookout) the last week in June. On Friday, the 28th, it looked like the hatch was just starting in that area."
1918946,Hump,2013-07-03 07:58:00,578,They were hatching last week( last week of June) . Walleyes were belly full of them.
1919626,KC Walleye,2013-07-03 10:44:00,274,Thanks guys for the heads up and the good read. I appreciate it.
1920266,Pat,2013-07-03 15:20:00,203,Full force hatch the last few days here on Black Sturgeon Lake just north of Kenora. Fishing sloooow.....
1921834,Fisherman Ted,2013-07-04 08:36:00,461,One hatch here outside of Kenora on Hawk Lake. Top-water nirvana for smallies!
1932481,Further North,2013-07-08 20:25:00,2008,They were thick on Clearwater and Pipestone last week.
1889625,neiafisherman,2013-06-22 21:19:00,3,"Haven't seen anyone talking about may flies this year. With the late ice, have they shown up yet? Heading to Minaki the end of June, just curious if we will run into them."
1890593,dog2,2013-06-23 10:52:00,198,alot depends on water temperature2 the 51 lat line we usually hit them from july10 to 25 .but the late spring could set them back aweek or so .
1890929,3M TA3,2013-06-23 13:26:00,2846,"Gee Whiz. I was fishing Erie at Port Clinton area the last few days and I have never seen so many flies hatching, ever. And holy smoke, the castings on the water were incredible to see. Mile after mile of bands 3 to 4 feet wide. Still caught lots of fish though. Monsters, too."
1892361,octanehi5,2013-06-24 05:30:00,1104,"They are changing the name from mayfly to julyfly,depends on how far north you are."
1892601,wallydave,2013-06-24 07:12:00,2151,"I left the Ear Falls area Thursday, I saw a couple on the cabin as we were loading the car. A few more on the windshield too, yum bug mustard"
1894361,yurtman,2013-06-24 16:33:00,46,"We cottage at War Eagle Lake, just down the road from Minaki. Found a few dozen mayflies on my boat when I checked it this morning so it looks like they are here - or at least on their way."
1894705,lowgator,2013-06-24 18:54:00,6,woke up to the cabins plastered with them this morning
1912658,unclepaully,2013-07-01 13:07:00,112,Any updates on the mayflies??? Heading up to the Nakina area in a couple of weeks and I was wondering if we are going to run into them.
1912690,wallydave,2013-07-01 13:15:00,2151,"http://www.northlandtackle.com/Categ...in.taf?cat=595These are new this year, I had some with me in June, but they hatch hadn't happened yet! Good luck!"
1913650,packpro,2013-07-01 18:44:00,695,Left NW Ontario (45 min north of Vermillion Bay) on Saturday. They were just starting to show up on the day we left. Lots of them on the window of the cabin as we were departing.
