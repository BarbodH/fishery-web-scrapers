My wife and I caught over 370 walleyes and over 170 smallmouths. Fished six days but not very many hours each day it was to hot four days to sit all day in my boat

1968577,Terwalleye,2013-07-21 11:17:00,166,"RonCedar is pretty ideal (IMHO) for a newby. It is very easy to navigate and based on our groups first attempt 4 years ago, was fairly easy to find some fish. It is really a great fishery with both quantity and quality. For a drive in location it is east to get to and no need to go off roading down miles of logging roads."
