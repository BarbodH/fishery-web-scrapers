574752,Guest,2008-06-07 14:30:00,0,"I found the fish in the weeds and in the bays. Found them on the rocks also, almost everyplace we tried there were walleye. We really hammered them on a wind blown shoreline in about 2ft of water."
574757,hiwayman,2008-06-07 20:50:00,201,"Any place in particular? Ball lake, Indian or any place special? Did you camp or stay at the marina?"
574762,Guest,2008-06-08 08:00:00,0,"In behind Ball Lake lodge there is a point on the north side with a cpl rocks exposed, its good around there. Adter that drive east till you hit weed in the bay, those are good. Also on Indian Lake just below the fast water look for a hump, loaded with fish there. Also Maynard Falls is hitting real good on the north side of it. You'll be driving right by me if your going up there, I'm at junction 11/71, JD Junction store is at the corner. I have the map for the area and could show you some spots if you stop by here. email me at [email protected]"
