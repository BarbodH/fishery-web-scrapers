574776,onemorecast,2008-06-08 19:29:00,23,"I used it last year, mostly 3 inch shad and shiners, some leaches. It worked, but not as good as live minnows on picky walleye. But if the bite is on there was little difference. I will use it again this year. The upside is that is more durable than minnows and over time less expensive."

Live minnows and crawlers out fished the Gulp products hands down. As mentioned above, I think if the bite was very good, I think they would be a viable option. In our experiences, live bait out fished all artificial on this past trip. Hope your trip goes well. tonyo"
