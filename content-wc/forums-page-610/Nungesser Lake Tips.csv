574360,Guest,2008-05-28 08:43:00,0,"Last year the cabin next to us trolled the weedlines in North Bay with big musky type lures and got a 46 and a 50. I saw the digital pics. We trolled the area but did not get anything over 35. I did not have any lures the size they were using. If you look on the map that is supplied on the website for Nungessor Lake Lodge, you will see a red dot just below 30 in South Bay. That dot is a marker bouy and we trolled around those humps and caught some big fish. Biggest was a 40. For walleye, we found them all over. If there is a midlake hump there will be fish on it. Gull rock was very productive. There is a big rocky shelf to the west of the rock and the whole shelf produced fish. 150 Yards to the west is where we started our drift and got 3 or 4 fish per drift. Motored around and did it again and again. We anchored just off Gull Rock and casted to it and when it was windy, the big walleyes were right on Gull Rock. During drifts we got fish from 14 to 17. On the rock the fish up to 25. We never got anything bigger then 25 for the trip in the boat. I did lose one big one at the boat but never got to measure it. The picnic area to the south of Gull Rock is a great place with a lot of room."
574374,sidewinder,2008-05-28 12:04:00,96,"learned this from a group at Sportsmans lodge. Works like a charm 1. 36"" leader 2 best kept secret circle hooks! Cannot remember isze off hand but circle should be big enough for quarter to fit through. 3. gremlin weights the ones with rubber straps,above leader. whatever weight is needed to keep bait down. 4 cigar shaped slip float about 8"" long (cigar cuts down on drag when setting hook. You could put hooks on cigar float because I have teeth marks all over them from curious pike,just joking about hooks but not joking about teeth marks. 5. Let float go under casuall pick up pole reel in slack if any, count to say 5 6. With pole pointingtowards water and pike slowly lift rod up to about 10:00 oclock and hold it there. 7. Most amazing thing I have ever witnessed --you can actually feel the bait slipping out of pikes mouth to the point you think you lost him,but you got him! That circle hook works it's way into the corner of mouth and the fight is on. Hook up rate is incredible. 8. Bring him to boat reach down with pliers unhook while in water, watch out for greedy pike trying to get easy meal of you or other pike! 9. reload and do it again"

574220,Guest,2008-05-22 20:47:00,0,"There are only a few places you can still go and catch monster pike and this is one of them, and out of all them the most affordable. last year me and a friend caught many over 40 and to big pike( 45-48), and seen one that went in the high 50's . I have been at a lot of camps and this one i look forward to the most. And as far as using dead suckers, if you want to catch big ones you have to drop the plugs and use the dead bait."
574221,Guest,2008-05-22 20:51:00,0,"Hey Donald, once you've had a chance to view the website and see what I'm talking about you'll know that ""FACTS"" is all my post was based on. If you would like me to go into detail, the gentlemans name is Jack Tilka and the pictures are from North Trout Lake and Setting Net Lake and thats the ""FACT"". I had no intention of taking it this far but once you challenged that ""all"" the pictures were from Nungesser and that you knew it for a ""fact"" I had no choice but to defend myself. P.S. if you do some searches on this site you will find that I am not the first person to notice this."
574222,Guest,2008-05-22 21:04:00,0,"LAST YEAR WE FISHED NUNGESSER FOR THE FIRST TIME. HAD A GREAT TIME, THE WALLEYE FISHING WAS EXCELLENT. I AM NEW, FISHING WITH SUCKERS, LIVE OR DEAD FOR NORTHERN. SHOULD I FISH THEM ON A JIG OR BOBBER? IN THE RIVER OR THE BAYS, DEEP 10-20 FEET OR SHALLOW 2-8 FEET? SHOULD I DRIFT OR ANCHOR IN THE WIND OR CALM WATER? HOW LONG SHOULD I GIVE A SPOT AND MOVE ON? IS THE MORNING OR EVENING BETTER? OVER CAST OR SUNNY DAYS? THANKS FOR ALL YOUR INPUT GUYS, NEED A LITTLE HELP WITH THE PIKE."
574226,Juls,2008-05-23 04:33:00,13414,I just looked at the website...it looks like you have yourself a little piece of Heaven on Earth there Kevin. Very nice. :) Best wishes for a successful season this year. Juls
574245,Guest,2008-05-23 09:40:00,0,"Hey guys thanks for the kind words. Kind of warms the heart. I did look at the page 2005-2006 report and there are some pics of jack that don't belong there. I haven't had a look around my site in quite a while. Originally those pics were on a page describing my guiding and were not intended or trying to pretend they had anything to do with Anglers Kingdom. That was done before I ever opened the doors the first year. That guiding page was removed. Not sure how the pics ended up on the bottom of that page but they definitely shouldn't have. This morning I asked my web guy to remove them. They will be gone pretty quick. My apollogies, I definitely wasn't trying to misrepresent anything. That being said- I'm guessing that I have about 3-400 pics on the site and I estimate that I have nearly a thousand other pictures that I haven't put on the website. So I'm pretty sure that a few errant pics of jack hasn't skewed things too much. It definitely wasn't the case that ""all of the pics of all huge fish"" were from somewhere else. It would have been simpler to email me and bring it to my attention rather than discuss it on a bunch of websites. However that seems to be the way things are done on these discussion boards. Oh I should mention that we've caught many big pike and walleye on artificial lures. Each week is different and I do try to give my guests the best information I can. Anyways I thank all of you who posted positive remarks. I don't have time to view these boards often but people do bring it to my attention when required. Last week was extremely busy. Opening week always is but when you ad a late ice out it seems to triple the work. Spent a few days breaking ice so we could get our guests to camp. Fishing has been good. Quite a few over 40 and several over 45 caught so far. ""most on dead bait"""" Tuesday was the first day everyone was able to reach the far end of the lake. Lots of big walleye being caught which is surprising since they are still spawning or recuperating from it. I'll try to post more details and some pics soon."
574247,Guest,2008-05-23 10:14:00,0,"I just wanted to send a quick apology to Kevin, Anglers Kingdom and whoever else this offended. I happen to be the group leader of the trip in which nebraskapike is referring to. After our trip I sent a letter and a post to Kevin defending him and his operation after a group early last year blasted him and his lodge after some extremely cold tempetures and a bad storm. As I stated then, Kevin and his staff were excellent. Our group did not catch many fish on artificial lures and spent most of the time in the river mouth soaking suckers and caught some really nice pike and walleyes. This was the first time any of us had done this kind of fishing and it just isn't for everyone. I don't think that you cannont catch anything on artificials, as Kevin stated to us it just happened that natures calander determined that dead bait would be our best option for the week we were their. The dragon flies were hatching when we left and from what I hear the group after us did very well on the traditional spoons ect... I just want everyone to know for the records that I will be visiting Anglers Kingdom again but had to unfortunately cancel this years trip. I personally had the largest pike and walleye of my young fishing career on the end of my line on my trip, they just did not cooperate."
574266,pike50plus,2008-05-23 18:36:00,584,Kevin's pike fishing dvd is outstanding too!
574283,sidewinder,2008-05-25 09:00:00,96,"ok when kevin first opened camp ,his site had photos of some nice 40+ pike that were all caught on the same day in the same spot on Little Vermillion ,his brothers camp. I was there and staying with the two guys in the pictures. I figured, how do you market a camp with no pictures, no big deal. You want to catch big pike go to Sportsmans Lodge on Little Vermillion, downside is you will rarely catch a walleye over 16 inches. My theory on that is those monster pike eat them fat slow walleyes. So jig with a 8lb piece of meat and forget colors. Other than the above day mentioned want catch a big pike soak some meat, or for you purists a #8 silver sucker.lol iIloved Nungesser believe Kevin is first rate. Sidewinder to walleyecentral Murray to Kevin"
574329,Guest,2008-05-27 07:25:00,0,Can someone provide the specifics on how they set up the dead bait presentation for a rookie? Thanks
574330,Guest,2008-05-27 08:58:00,0,"We used a cobra esox jig made by bait rigs, we then used a stinger hook. Hooked the sucker through the nose and then put the stinger about 6inches back. When using a stinger we chose to set the hook rather quickly to reduce the risk of hurting the fish at Kevins request. He is all about protecting his fish and if you have a chance to watch his video it is very informative about how to handle the fish ext... If you are heading to Nungesser I'll be you catch some nice walleyes on the suckers while your fishing for pike."
574178,Guest,2008-05-22 12:00:00,0,JACK TILKA MUST HAVE LOTS OF TIME AND MONEY TO SPEND THREE FULL SUMMERS AT AK. AND GENEROUS AS WELL TO ALLOW ALL THOSE PEOPLE TO HOLD HIS FISH. ACTUALLY ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE CAUGHT THEIR FISH AT WAY NORTH AND I JUST PUT THEM ON THE WEB SITE TO FOOL PEOPLE INTO THINKING THAT THERE ARE FISH IN NUNGESSER LAKE. THAT WAY ALL MY GUESTS WILL BE DISAPPOINTED WHEN THEY VISIT. WITHOUT THE SARCASM I CAN SAY THAT IN EARLY SPRING USING DEAD BAIT IS OFTEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE METHOD. ESPECIALLY IF A PERSON IS NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE LAKE. A PERSON NEEDS TO HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THE FISH ARE IN THE EXACT LOCATION YOUR LURE IS. OTHERWISE PEOPLE WILL OFTEN MOVE ON BEFORE THE FISH HAVE BECOME ACTIVE ENOUGH TO FEED. I TELL MY GUESTS LOTS OF DIFFERENT METHODS DEPENDING THE SITUATION AT THAT TIME. WHETHER PEOPLE CHOOSE TO CONSIDER IT IS UP TO THEM. I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM GOING ON A PUBLIC FORUM AND MAKING A STATEMENT. AND I DO IT WITH MY REAL NAME ATTACHED TO IT. .
574181,Guest,2008-05-22 13:15:00,0,"I stand corrected I just viewed the web site and there are only a few pictures in which the pike were caught at Way North not a majority as my earlier post stated. I do beleive that a majority of people on this site use a name other than the biological one given to them, I chose a name based on where I live and what I prefer to fish for. Nevertheless you will catch some above average walleye and northern if you are willing to soak dead bait. We caught some very nice walleye (26""28"") in the two holes up the river with large suckers while fishing for Northern and lost a few that were definately over the 30"" mark. Didn't mean to affend anyone."
574183,Guest,2008-05-22 13:52:00,0,"What's up Kevin G I've got all the faith in the world about the lake and your resort, I've read nothing but GREAT things.Since you read this site how about a little info on how this early season is looking. I've read most lakes are a few weeks behind, is that good for us coming up June 7-14? Any other info would be cool. Getting excited- 15 days left to vacation. Thanks Mike Mc"

574209,Guest,2008-05-22 16:21:00,0,"The key to early season pike is to do a dead bait presentation, We used Essox Cobra jigs tiped with an 8 inch sucker minnow. It was deadly and we caught many of the grannys of the lake. Our Biggest were 43 and 45 inches. ALSO TRY DOING A SLOW RETRIEVE WITH A CAUGHT WALLEYE AND THE FUN WILL REALLY START.

Like I said in my last post there are only a few pictures on the site (not a majority) that are not from Nungesser but if you choose to disagree take a close look at the pictures from the 2005-2006 gallery and look at the gentleman in the yellow rain suit and take note of the boats they are fising out of. Kevin has top of the line equipment at Angler's Kingdom, take a look for yourself and make your own conclusion."
574000,Guest,2008-05-17 16:23:00,0,We are heading to Nungesser Lake which is near Red Lake in Ontario in the second week in June. This is our first time to this lake and we understand the walleye and northern fishing is top-notch. Has anyone been to this lake and what specific spots have you found successful? I am taking my son and want to introduce him to fishing with a successful week. Any insight would be helpful!
574004,Pooch,2008-05-17 19:11:00,4619,Search this site. There are a number of old posts concerning Nungesser. Pooch
574028,Guest,2008-05-19 09:02:00,0,There is so much super structure on this lake that I believe it would be impossible to spend a week fishing and not get into some great Walleye and Northern fishing even by accident. If you are staying at AK....Kevin and his people will make sure you get on fish.
574057,Guest,2008-05-19 20:45:00,0,"hope you have good insurance, A lot of rocks! The lake should be a few weeks behind so look shallow and if you are not using suckers, work very slow. When i was up there water temp was 48 and unlike what some will say , fish did bite good with slow moving baits. But i would say use suckers , they are a sure bet."
574058,Guest,2008-05-19 21:27:00,0,"Don't plan on catching anything unless you have a sucker or a minnow on. Been going to Canada for 10 years now and this is the only lake I have ever fished in which I did not catch a single fish on a spoon, or a jig tipped with anything but a minnow or sucker."
574061,Guest,2008-05-20 05:57:00,0,I was at Nungessor last year in early August. I caught all of the walleye I needed mostly with worms .
574074,Guest,2008-05-20 12:03:00,0,We went in early June and caught some nice fish. If you are willing to soak dead bait and sit you will catch some nice fish. Just don't be fooled by the fish on the web site as a majority were caught at Way North Lodge by Jack Tilka who is pictured with most of the huge pike.
574100,lobo1,2008-05-21 03:23:00,734,"We found the fishing to be average but that's comparing it to our other Canada trips which have been outstanding - we're probably spoiled. If you don't mind the boat ride go as far as you can to the far east end of the lake - the Nungesser River dumps in there - has lots of fish early in the season. The bay that this dumps into is called Whitefish Bay holds tons of fish and should keep you busy for the day. The point (west side) right where the river dumps out and the shoreline there has a nice edge to fish before/after you are done in the river. Also - there is an established shore lunch spot in the SW corner of this bay - so you can cook up a nice lunch and stay here for the day. If you like to make a fire - bring a few pieces of dry camp wood from whatever camp you are coming from - just insurance in case there is no good dry stuff near the spot you want to make your shore lunch. Power bait and Gulp should produce plenty of walleyes so don't worry about minnows. However - even KG said that suckers are the bait of choice for the pike. I don't go to Canada to bait fish so I never used them. We caught plenty of pike on spoons but nothing close to 40"" - which is our measuring stick for a good Canada pike. good luck. lobo1"
574142,Guest,2008-05-21 14:09:00,0,"Hey Lobo1 Thanks for the info on Nungesser. I'm going up for the first time to Nungesser June 6 - 14 was hoping to get some more detailed info on the lake and fishing.Were you walleye or pike fishing? were you casting jigs/lures or were you trolling? any HOT colors? Early or late was best? I'm staying at Anglers Kingdom, any other locations closer incase the weather gets bad? anything else you thing might help would be AWESOME. Thanks Mike"
574153,lobo1,2008-05-21 18:44:00,734,"They will put you on fish there at Kevin's place....have no fear. I am not all that familiar with the lake but know of the spot I spoke of and it is full of fish and if you get a nice day take a drive down there. No doubt you can catch fish closer to home - probably right behind the cabin We jig walleyes with mainly white power baits and heads and have never had a problem anywhere we have been. When it gets slow we switch to Gulp minnows and they work well. We cast spoons and spinners for pike - I think it is a one hook lake....we never had any problems catching them but never got any good ones either - I think our best was 35"". good luck, Steve"
