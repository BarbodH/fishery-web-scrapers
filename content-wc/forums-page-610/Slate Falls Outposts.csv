We are heading to Gull Lake. Does anyone have any experience with Slate Falls? Any specific information on Gull Lake would be really appreciated. I did a search but all of the information is old. Thanks!!"
573931,Guest,2008-05-15 06:06:00,0,Are you going to his north outpost or south outpost? I've been to the north cabin 5 or 6 times. Verne is a great outfitter !!
573941,Guest,2008-05-15 09:31:00,0,"We have used Verne for 10 years- he is great to work with and will do about anything to accommodate his fishermen. We are putting him to the test this weekend- plan to arrive in Sioux lookout tomorrow, with major ice issues on our outpost lake, St Joe's. In my opinion, the a first class operation run by a topnotch guy. Fishing can't be any better than St joe in the early spring."
573974,connaughty,2008-05-16 09:48:00,4,"Thanks for the feedback guys. I will be at Gull South. If you can point me to any specific areas that you target on that lake, I would appreciate it. Also, do you feel I need to purchase minnows? Typically in our previous fly in trips we basically take jigs and plastic for walleyes and spoons for notherns - not much else. May take some Gulp but we were undecided about minnows (so expensive. We are going in blind. Important trip as it will be my son's first.. I have heard great things as well about Verne."
573989,drlee,2008-05-16 19:23:00,409,"We have had very good luck with salted minnows on Slate Falls Outpost fly-in trips. We have always fished Lake St. Joseph and the accommodations and service from Vern has always been first class. We use jigs with a salt minnow and 100 walleye days (per person) are not uncommon. You don't, obviously, have any trouble with preservation. I use the same bait on drive in trips to Paskokogan, Press, and Lac Seul, as well as a few other drive in lakes. I have never been disappointed. I hear from others that live minnows outfish salted, but the data does not support their claims. I know you will have a great time and great service with Slate Falls...I will spend a month in northern ontario this summer and can hardly wait! Best of Luck!!"

574670,Guest,2008-06-04 16:07:00,0,"TWO FRIENDS AND I HAVE BEEN TO LAKE MINNISS ABOUT THIRTEEN YEARS, I AM OLD NOW. WE ALWAYS TAKE A FEW VIRGIN CANADA FISHERMEN WITH US TO COMPLETE THE GROUP.IT IS LIKE CATCHING FISH IN A BARREL ALOT OF YEARS. A COUPLE OF YEARS WERE KIND OF SLOW....MEANING ONLY 3-4 HUNDRED FISH FOR THE WEEK. WE NEVER HAD MUCH LUCK WITH LIVE MINNOWS...QUICK DEATH SYNDROME...FOR US, WORMS ARE THE ANSWER...ONE-THIRD OF A WORM GOES A LONG WAY--JUST FIGURE THE AMT OF FISHERPEOPLE, THE AMT OF DAYS AND ABOUT 20 WORMS FOR EACH PER DAY OR SO--IT'S A BUMMER TO RUN OUT..COLORED JIG HEADS DIFFERENT WEIGHTS DEPENDING ON THE CONDITIONS..OH YEAH--ABOUT EIGHT YEARS AGO, MY GIRLFRIEND--NOW MY WIFE WENT TO LAKE MASCARA--- SHE FISHED NUDE FOR MOST OF THE WEEK--IT WAS ALOT MORE FUN THAN FISHING WITH THE GUYS."
574730,connaughty,2008-06-06 07:54:00,4,"Eric, do you mind if I invite your wife along with us next week:)) just kidding. Thanks for the info. We are extremely excited and my son is loosing sleep over this. We may look into nightcrawlers as we get across the border. Thanks..."
