We usually fish around the sanctury mouth, sawmill bay, Lunker Pt, islands around Cox's island, Iron Creek, Bannatyne Creek Bay, Narrows. Eyes were not out around the islands much at all yet, or up the river towards the dam, or in the narrows. There were a lot of eyes around the sanctuary mouth, Lunker pt, Iron Creek, Bannatyne Bay. Seemed to be moving out of the warmer bays and sanctuary but not out to their normal hideouts this time of year yet. Caught more Pike and Perch this year then any other year. Many big Pike around. Perch were a nuisance. Minnows outfished Crawlers 3-1. Didn't try leeches but GULP 3"" white minnows also worked well (although not as well as the real deal). Started cutting minnows in half and caught just as many fish (hey, at 4.50 a doz its worth a try!) Gas was $6.50/gal at camp, $5.00 and up at the pumps. Visibly less fisherman around the lake. Also, I spooled Berkley Fireline Crystal (8lb) before I left and replaced it with Trilene XT after 1 day. What garbage! No matter what knot or how wet the line was, I found it to be very brittle and breakable. After multiple failures, it just wasn't worth messing with."
