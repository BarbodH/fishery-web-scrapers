574623,Guest,2008-06-03 12:29:00,0,Do they have a duty free store going into Canada like they do coming out at International Falls?
574833,Guest,2008-06-09 19:30:00,0,"Yes, Canadian beer is $17/case, $16 for a qty of 5 and $15 for a qty of 10. And it's 5% imported from Canada. Just stop at the Amex duty free 2 blocks before the bridge."
574841,Guest,2008-06-09 21:22:00,0,We buy our beer now at the US Duty Free store when heading in. A case(24 -12oz cans) of Labatts or Kokanee(better than Labatts) was 16 or 17 a case a few weeks ago when we went thru. We pay the duty for the overs and it does save $$$$. I think our extra case was around $9.00. We declared it when going thru and it was only about a 3 minute delay to go in and pay the duty and we were on our way. I don't think they relate what you declare as an opportunity to do a full check. I think that it is totally random or you have a goofball in your vehicle that can't keep their mouth shut and let the driver do the talking at the checkpoint. We usually discuss and cover all possible questions before we get to the border so we are positive and don't miss anything. 7

574561,phishfearme,2008-06-02 10:41:00,1242,they will take both including credit cards. phish
574562,back357,2008-06-02 10:43:00,106,Thanks for the info. I really appreciate it.
574563,deputy dog,2008-06-02 10:45:00,305,"is duty a set price per case or is it based on the value of the item? also, which is cheaper, paying duty or buying in canada or does the duty even it out. thanks"
574564,back357,2008-06-02 10:53:00,106,"My understanding is that the duty is calculated based on the original receipt for the item. So it will vary. From previous posts, it seems that beer prices are a bit steep right now in Canada (somewhere between $40 - $45 per case). If my assumption is correct, I am going to pay somewhere in the neighborhood of $12 per case of beer for duty. That brings my total for bringing beer to $30 a case (assuming I paid around $18). While I do enjoy the Canadian beer while I'm up there, I'm just looking to offset a bit of the costs this year. We travel up with a group of 8 individuals and typically purchase around 12 cases of beer while up there. If I can save $15 a case, it might make sense, assuming I have the space ($180). I know it sounds cheap, but just trying to reduce costs where I can."
574567,Guest,2008-06-02 12:51:00,0,"Just be prepared for a slight delay depending on when you are going across. We went across last week at about 5 pm on Friday when they weren't busy. We claimed are extra booze but since we were pulling over to pay, they decided to tear us down and run background checks. It took about 1.5 hours more than it should have. We also packed quckly and didn't all booze in one defined area of the vehicle (our fault)"

To answer your question, since you are declaring at the Canadian border, all fees would be charged in Canadian funds."
574571,Guest,2008-06-02 12:58:00,0,"If your paying $30 a case with duty too bring it across the border.. Buy labatts genuine draft at the Beer Store,, its $28.35 including deposit."
574581,Waxy,2008-06-02 15:55:00,2938,">it seems that beer prices are a bit steep >right now in Canada (somewhere between $40 - $45 per case). Is a case 12 or 24 for you Americans? Canada - case/box = 12, flat or 2-4 = 24. If it's 12, WOW! Where are you buying your beer! If it's 24, WOW again! You can buy 24 beer down there for $12? The beer is terrible ( :) ) but that's CHEAP. I just bought a 15 pack of Molson Pilsner cans yesterday for $17 plus deposit, so less than $20. There's no way that a 12 pack of typical Molson or Labatt beer should be any more than $20 or so, MAYBE $25 for the ""premium"" stuff. Waxy"
