574778,Guest,2008-06-08 21:01:00,0,Headed to Canada next week and plan on coming across the border late Saturday night. Our plan is to stop in Ft Francis after getting across the border. Does anyone now of a good place to park a motorhome for a few hours in Ft Francis? Does the wal mart there alow motorhome parking like the others in the states. Thanks. JR
