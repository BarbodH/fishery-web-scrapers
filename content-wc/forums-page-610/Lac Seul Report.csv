574608,CH47,2008-06-03 06:35:00,29,"Scar, Archies Landing is for Mahkwa guests and the local Ojibway population only. I have a small jpeg of a satellite image of the area but I don't know how to upload to this site. CH47"
574628,Guest,2008-06-03 16:07:00,0,"Mahkwa Lodge is in the bay just west of the mouth of Vaughan Lake. If you go around the first point along the northwest shore from the mouth of Vaughan then Mahkwa is tucked back in that next bay where the light bulb shaped point juts out into the main lake. The boat landing is on the main shoreline east of Kejick Bay Island. You cannot boat up to Rice Lake. You can boat up to where the 3 Point Bay narrows down to the incoming stream from Rice Lake. In high water years like this year there is a pretty good basin at the upper end of 3 Point that often produces walleye and pike, but this year they just were not up there in great numbers. Just inside the mouth of 3 point the channel bends way over near the east shore and you will see the stumps sticking up. Those stumps are in 3-4 feet of water, but just to the east of the stumps it drops off to about 10 feet of water in the channel. Normally this is a great place for walleye fishing. Please feel free to call me at 402-730-0053. Steve"
574629,Guest,2008-06-03 16:13:00,0,"We do not boat from Hudson. We drive in on gravel roads about 25 miles to the boat landing across from Kejick Bay Island. Mahkwa Lodge has exclusive rights to the landing, so you must be staying at the Lodge. I put my boat in at the Hudson Boat Landing one day with my younger son and boated to Webster Bay. We did quite well on both pike and walleye in that Bay and we did not have a clue where to fish when we got in there. If you do that you will go under the road that goes into the boat landing. Fishing at that bridge would be a great place for walleye. Any place there is a natural funnel to constrict the walleye passage then you can count on great fishing. That is why Chamberlain Narrows is about as good as you can get it for walleye. It would be a long, long boat ride from Hudson to Mahkwa area. However, I was checked by a game warden one day near Mahkwa who routintely puts in at Deception Bay and does a circular route all the way to Mahkwa and back including stopping at Chamberlain Narrows.

574523,Guest,2008-05-31 14:45:00,0,"We fished out of Mahkwa Lodge from May 24th to May 29th. We had an outstanding year on pike (455 for the three of us) with many in the 34-39 range, but nothing over 39 this year. The walleye fishing was nearly a bust, which is not a big deal for us because we fish pike most of the time. Apparently the late ice out prevented the walleye from moving up the streams to spawn, so they were still staging on the main lake. Each night we caught a few more, but it was nothing like normal. One guide told us that he did his normal 18 walleye spot tour and did not catch a walleye on the first 16 sites. He did fairly well in deeper water on the break on the last 2 sites of the day. We had moose walk out onto the shore by where we were fishing, lots of close-by Bald Eagles, fox, beaver, waterfowl and hawks. It is neat to be jigging for walleye in the evening and be entertained by the thumping of the chest by Ruffed Grouse, beaver slapping their tails, loons calling and owls hooting. We experienced a raging snow storm, rough water and two shirt sleeve sunny days. You get it all in Canada and I would not have it any other way. Best wishes!! NE Piker"
574529,Guest,2008-05-31 17:39:00,0,"NE Piker, Did they have the new bridge finished allowing you to drive directly into Mahkwa? If not, any word on when they plan on having it completed. Thanks. Jiggin John"
574537,JDP,2008-05-31 22:44:00,1457,"I was up to Mahkwa Lodge May 17-24 this year. No bridge yet. A member of my group spoke with the Mahkwa staff about said bridge...Apparently the funding has been approved/allocated and the bridge is to be built this summer (""by August""). Maybe NE Piker had a first hand conversation regarding the bridge. JDP"
574540,Guest,2008-06-01 08:29:00,0,"As JP said the bridge has not been constructed yet. I actually forgot to ask about it, so JP provided more information than I knew. I learned a little history from Roger Bull this year that Ontario DNR granted Mahkwa rights to the central part of the lake, so that is why the nearest lodge to the west is SWWL and the east is Chamberlain Narrows. The walleye fishing at Chamberlain Narrows has got to be the best of anywhere, but I would not trade the pike fishing in the Mahkwa area for any place else. If you look at the Navionics colored image that lays on the table in the Mahkwa rec room you can see there is a lot more yellow marsh land around Mahkwa than anywhere else on the lake, so that is why the pike fishing is so good on the central part of the lake. 360 days and counting. NE Piker"
574546,Guest,2008-06-01 17:42:00,0,NE Piker are you fishing three point bay at all? is the mahkwa lodge on the north bank? do you fly in? thank you
574553,JDP,2008-06-02 07:14:00,1457,"I fished 3 Point Bay during the week of May 17-24 for walleyes. We caught fish in 4-10 feet of water. Surface water temps in 3PB reached high 40's by the end of the week. As NE Piker noted most of the main lake walleyes apparently were still staging in deep water prior to spawning in the shallower bays, creeks,etc. JDP"
574586,Guest,2008-06-02 18:30:00,0,"We drive in to the boat landing from Hudson and then boat less than a mile to Mahkwa Lodge on the south side of the lake. We fished the mouth of 3 Point every evening. Our routine is to fish pike all day and then make a half hearted effort at walleye in the evening. In the past all we had to do was tie our boat to the trees at the mouth of 3 Point and catch all the walleye we wanted. Some years they are in the shallow 4 feet or less water and other years they are in the channel, so we can fish either way from the stumps. This year we had more luck in the shallow water, but the fishing was very slow compared to every other years I have been there. From talking to the the guides I am fairly confident the walleye were still on the main lake staged on the breaks. We had so much fun catching pike this year that we did not take the time necessary to go find the walleye. NE Piker"
574587,Guest,2008-06-02 18:57:00,0,"JDP & NE Piker, thank you for the info. I have the southwest section map of Lac Seul. I see where Hudson is. where is Mahakwa Lodge? the three point bay - is that near eagle island? and does it run up to rice lake? If so, can you get into rice lake? Could I call you by phone? if so, email me your number please and I will call you. [email protected] thank you"
574596,scar,2008-06-02 20:38:00,196,how is the boat ride from hudson landing to mahkawa area. looking at my map it looks like a very long twisted and winding way to get there? how long does it take? i have a 115 optimax and can cruise at about 30 mph. any danger areas? scar
574601,JDP,2008-06-02 23:03:00,1457,"Scar, The landing used for Mahkwa Lodge is called Archies Landing. It is located in/on Vaughn Bay about a 1/2 mile Northeast of the opening to Vaughn Lake. It is not located in the town of Hudson. You do drive through Hudson to get to Archie's Landing. (Check Mahkwa Lodge's website for the directions).http://www.mahkwa.ca/location.html Only takes 10 minutes or so to boat from the Landing to Mahkwa. There is one spot where you drive slowly through a couple of stumps and rocks, otherwise it is clear sailing. Once the bridge is built and open Archie's landing will no longer be needed for Mahkwa Lodge guests. JDP."
