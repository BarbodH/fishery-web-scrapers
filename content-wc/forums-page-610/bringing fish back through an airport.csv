574731,Guest,2008-06-06 10:12:00,0,You can check it without any problems. Just make sure to tell them you have dry ice in the cooler.

Yes, be sure to let them know what it is ahead of time, and it is perishable if lost. You may also want to check with your airline(s) ahead of time, since some have started charging extra for more than one piece of baggage or carry-on item. Chuck"
