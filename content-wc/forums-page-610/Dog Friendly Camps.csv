574740,Guest,2008-06-06 15:27:00,0,">Witch Bay Camp...very pet friendly. Drive to camp, and very >very secluded on LOTW. > >witchbay.com Yup. I second Witch Bay Camp. I have now made 25 trips there in 14 years (I am retired and go 3 or 4 times a year). I have taken my Labs there since I first went to the camp in 1993. The owners have 5 dogs, the staff employed last year had at least 3 dogs, plus my 2 ... etc. LOTS of dogs in camp. Heck, if we take my Labs fishing with us on a given day, the camp even makes extra sandwiches for them!!!!! lol. I was stunned the first time I saw that!"
574741,Guest,2008-06-06 15:28:00,0,"Oh, and the fishing and the people are great too, by the way! Which is why my 3 summer trips this year will be numbers 26, 27, and 28!!!"
574663,Guest,2008-06-04 14:41:00,0,Got the okay to head up in late Aug but I will be taking my 2 Golden Retreivers. It will be just me as my fishing partners are taking the year off. We usually do a fly-in but this time it would be a drive to. Anyone know of any camps that let you bring dogs.

Also, I love the name, as I'm a huge Cardinals fan! I thought from the start of the season, this team would be better than people expected. Once Carp's back, the cards will be in great shape."

574677,Moss,2008-06-04 21:36:00,7,We allow friendly pets at Woman River Camp. Located 30 miles northeast of Ear Falls. We have a two year old husky/terrier named Timber. Loves to play. We also have no Blasto along our shorelines which you will want to watch out for down by the shores around Dryden. We winter in Dryden and our vet always keeps us up to date when it comes to our dog's health. Hope you have a good trip where ever you go. Moss

It is rustic and quite, we take our dog and cat there every year for over 10 years. Dog has run of the island, grouse seem to be there every year, and she swims at least a couple times a day in gin clear waters. Area is know for large musky, pike, bass, and lake trout. There are also walleye in shallower areas of the bay. A family run resort for over 50 years by Horley family(807-226-1216). Tell them Bob Lesner recommend their place to you ! BOB"
