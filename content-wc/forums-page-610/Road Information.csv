574738,Guest,2008-06-06 14:53:00,0,"We made a round-trip a week ago between Eau Claire and Bloomington: - There is some construction going on near the Rockford-Beloit toll booths. The lanes are very narrow, but there are still 2 lanes going each way. Travel was a little slower through the area. - There is some construction going on in Madison, primarily the center shoulders and area between the E-W lanes. At rush hour it was very slow, but not bad at non-rush hour. Sorry, don't have anything north of Eau Claire... Chuck"
