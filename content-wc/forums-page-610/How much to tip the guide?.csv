I can see the 10-20% rate and that would depend on what the guide did, tipping to me is for good service, not just showing up. How many days they can work, what financial bracket they're in or any of them other reasons are not reasons to tip. Seems we just went though this a bit ago, but I'll repeat what I said last time, make sure you and the guide agree on what the guide is going to do, and if he/she fails to do that, no tip, if they do that and more that's a tip and the size of the tip depends on they're performance. To me its all about what you feel comfortable giving. Personally I think tipping has got out of hand, we tip the waitress because she manages to get you the second cup of coffee, but do we tip the fireman/police or any emergency service for saving your life...no we don't. I'd rather call it a bonus, they go above and beyond basic service and they will get a bonus. Al"
574758,Obabikon,2008-06-07 21:15:00,2370,"Since this topic was brought backup... too many people over tip the guide and under tip the cook and other staff at the camp. I'll say the cleaning/serving crew work very hard, especially at American Plan resorts. I've seen a lot of guests drop $100-200 for the guide, and then leave $50 bucks for four girls and the cook to split! Guides make VERY good money right now ($150 per day is the average salary for guides out of Morson on LOTW), and they have a very important service. But please, the people behind the scenes have a very important role in a good trip! That being said... have fun, and tip if they deserve it. Michael J. Fox said something in the ""Secret of My Success"" when an awkward guy was trying to tip him $10... He said, ""at the end of your stay, if I'm worth it, tip me so much it feels like you're passing a kidney stone"" If the staff/guide has made it one of the best trips of your life, show it..."

574187,Northpoint,2008-05-22 14:34:00,38,"For the last couple of years my wife and I have tipped the guide $100 per day and $50 extra for after supper fishing. I have allways found the fishing good to excellent and the shore lunches way above my expectations. They work very hard from 8-5 and do virtually everything for us. My questions are whether people intend to increace the range abit from prior years to take into account the value of the dollar and whether I am still in the right range overall. Our resort does not have dock boys so maybe that is yet another factor as the guide gets the boat ready with bait, gas and ice each day and cleans the fish. I have also considered a nice big bonus for any 29"" or greater walleye my wife gets. Does anybody tip more for a trophy? It seems reasonable to me.....but I would like to know what others think as I don't want to be cheap. Thanks in advance for your comments."
574230,Obabikon,2008-05-23 05:40:00,2370,"I think your tipping amount is very good. Most people leave 150 bucks or so for 3 days of a guide. You'd be leaving twice that. I do think you should tip a guide extra for trophy fish. But, that's just my opinion."
574250,Guest,2008-05-23 10:35:00,0,"My Dad always said that the best tip you can give a Guide is ""Put us on Fish"". Seriously the only Guide I fish with charges $150 a day for three of in his boat. We fish with him for 5 days and tip him $300 for the week plus we always bring him a nice gift that is around $100."
574251,Guest,2008-05-23 10:54:00,0,WOW $100.00 to $150.00 per day. Seems high to me 10 to 20% ofthe daily rate seems appropriate to me
574253,Guest,2008-05-23 11:50:00,0,"Would seem to me you are being fairly generous. We usually have a group of 6 - 8 folks go and fish 2 men per boat w/ a guide. For the senior guides (3+ years experience), we tip around 75 - 90 dollars per day. For the junior guys (newbies), we tip around $50 / day. We fish 6 consecutive days from 8 - 5:30. One thing to note though is that our guides do in fact fish plus most of our group is fairly well adept at handling their own baits and unhooking fish. Hence, the guide primarily navigates and probably spends more than half his day actually fishing. We cover our base each year by asking the lodge owner what an appropriate tip is for the services and usually follow his advice. You make a good point though...the exchange rate on the dollar has hurt not only us but also the guides!"
574300,Guest,2008-05-25 18:42:00,0,"$100-$150 would be for more than an excellent couple days of fishing. Let's think this through. Most guides get paid between $95-$130 a day (sometimes more if there a speciality guide) The season is short, but let's think of what is involved with a guides day of work. Grab a couple scoops of minnows, and shore lunch kit (if dock boys do not do it for them) run the boat and trolling motor(which anyone can master after a few days fishing) Cook the shore lunch which does take some time to master especailly when you have to cook in the rain. than run the boat the rest of the afternoon and clean your fish when you get in. Some will have to gas up there boat, but many places have dock hands for this. So most of you who complain about the price of canadian beer, gas, etc. will give there guide a $100-$150 tip per day on top of there $100-$130 wage they are already getting. How many of you feel that for someone to take you fishing for a day is worth $200-$300 cash in pocket? Tipping has got out hand, when people see really clean grounds, grass nicely cut, flowers planted, how many of you go tip the grounds keeper for doing such a nice job. Or the maintance man to keep everything at the resort running including all the maintanance on the boat you fish out."
574309,Guest,2008-05-26 07:18:00,0,"One resort I am familiar with, in Ontario, suggests a tip of $15.00 per person per day for their guides. Remember, that is just suggested guidelines. If you have a guide that you feel is worth more, then tip accordingly."
574313,Atlanta Dave,2008-05-26 09:35:00,323,We atre going to Lac La marte this July and in the litature they suggest $80.00 per fisherman(2) for a five day trip. Atlanta DAve
574753,Guest,2008-06-07 14:43:00,0,"I know when I used to guide, I appreciated the guy who appreciates what the guide does. couple sccops of minnows, drive boat all day which anyone can master in a few days....lol. We consistants put you's on fish cause we know where to look and what to look for and what to use. Did you ever look at your guide in awe??hmmmmm what do we use this for...sounds like a $15.00 a day tip to me. What I'm saying just ask the serious fisherman at the dock what they tip a guide. Another thing you have to remember is where the camp is located, I guided at Great Bear Lake one season and my lowest tip was $600.00u.s. for a week and my lagest one there was over$1000.00 Most guides are seasonal workers so $100.00 per day+tip=$150.00 times that by 150 days = $22500.00 a year take away what it costs to live a year, the guy might make $10000.00 a year not much now ehhh."
574755,Guest,2008-06-07 17:13:00,0,"Its like anything else, it all depends on what the guest income is. if you take home a 100 grand or more sure you are going to feel quite generous but for the average bloke that saves all year for a trip and splurges for one day of guiding doubling the guides pay for one day is not good. the main thing is to be resonable and doubling the pay under any condition is not resonable. If guiding is not generating enough money for then he should have another job simple as that. speaking of the dollor, ours and theirs is within pennies of each other."
