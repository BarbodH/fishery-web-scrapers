Most of the large Northern came from a large bay at the south end of the lake. If I remember correctly it was called 35-mile Bay (or possibly 39-mile Bay). Had alot of success fishing #5 gold Mepps although the two largest pike came off a Black Suick. Caught Walleyes at dusk under the train bridge with a jig and night crawler. The only downside is we were blown off the lake on 2 of the 5 days we fished - alot of wide open water. Cabins, lodge and facilities were fairly basic."
