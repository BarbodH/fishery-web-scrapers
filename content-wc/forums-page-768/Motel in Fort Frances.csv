546632,Jignminnow,2005-03-28 06:33:00,42,"I know you already booked at The Rainbow and we used to stay there too. Right across the street is a gas station that sells bait and licenses and has an ATM machine to get Canadian cash. It gives you a much better rate then exchanging on our side. Consider this, Which way do you go Sat. morning? If you go West towards Minaki, Nestor Falls, Sioux Narrows etc. you might want to continue down that road to the Emo INN. You can wave at the Rainbow on the way by but do stop at the gas station and get the licenses out of the way. The Emo Inn is very large and has a huge parking lot well lit, a restaurant for dinner and breakfast and best of all, A BAR!!!!!!!! All the Blue you can consume unless I get there first. It is probably about a half hour down the road from the border but it puts you that much closer in the morning. It is about five minutes from the turn to go North. Hope this helps. Of course, if you go East in the morning this was just a bunch of hot air. Jignminnow <""{{{{{< tight lines wet nets"
546701,Fishoil,2005-03-30 19:13:00,1277,"Thanks for the hot..... ah I mean help. ;-) We head east when we leave in the morning. Besides that, I don't want any competition for the Blue."
546718,fishmaster,2005-03-31 15:24:00,209,"There will be plenty of Blue for all of us, if not Fort Fran has a problem on there hands?"
546198,Fishoil,2005-03-10 12:30:00,1277,"I'm looking for suggestions for a motel in Ft. Frances. Each year our group has been driving to International Falls on a Friday, spending the night, and crossing over on Sat. morning. We've never had a problem with the crossing, but I thought it might work better to get it out of the way when we get there on Friday. That way if we hit a delay it won't matter, it'll just cut in to our cocktail hour, not our fishing the next afternoon. Anyway, I need a motel that has a big enough lot for trucks with boats behind, is well lit to avoid the chances of theft, and has at least 4 or 5 rooms. A restaurant nearby would be a plus and a cold case of Blue waiting in the room would be a plus plus. ;-) Any suggestions?"
546204,fishmaster,2005-03-10 17:08:00,209,Try La Place Rendezvous nice place with good rates and nice bar area and good food. Been going there for several years now and they always take care of us well. 1-807-274-9811 Better book soon if you are going openning week cause they fill fast for Friday night. Good Luck Toll Free # 1-800-544-9435 They also have a web sitewww.rendezvoushotel.com
546210,dewyg,2005-03-11 01:25:00,1006,"The parking lot is to dark at the rendevous, try super 8 it is new and clean. The parking lot is lit and there is no bar so no problems with drunk people bothering your goods."
546222,fishmaster,2005-03-11 14:14:00,209,"I don't know I have been going here for years and we have never had a problem and it is lit and they do watch the lot during the night. But hey each is own I just offered the information based on my visits, I can't talk about the Super 8 cause we have never stayed there. If you wanted the price on rooms they are about $90 a for 2 queen size beds, and that is american ching."
546224,Guest,2005-03-11 15:35:00,0,when we stop at the redevoux we need to make reservationa almost the day we stay for the next year good luck
546231,rebelrn2001,2005-03-11 19:34:00,1563,My wife and I stay at the Makabi Inn (807) 274-9874. It is right downtown FF and while it is older and not the best place in town it is ok for us. The cost I think is around $60 Canadian. There is a restaurant inside too. The lot is lit and there is room for quite a few rigs. We'll be there on 6/10 this year.
546236,Guest,2005-03-12 14:08:00,0,La Place Rendezvous worked just fine for us last year. I plan on staying there again this year.
546242,fishmaster,2005-03-12 17:39:00,209,Heard they still have a few open rooms for Friday night on openning week-end in May.
546361,Guest,2005-03-17 08:35:00,0,"Try the Rainbow motel. Nothing flashy but you can park your boat right in fron of your room. Right across from a gas station, walmart and canadian tire. -DV"
546390,Guest,2005-03-17 19:43:00,0,"ditto rainbow. clean, quiet and cheap."
