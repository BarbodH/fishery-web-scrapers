546786,Bellcon,2005-04-05 07:57:00,2,"Bob, I have been to Little Vermillion Lake about 7 times. I will be heading up opening weekend this year. If trophy pike are what you are looking for than it is a very good lake. For the first 2-3 weeks after ice out most of big pike are in the backs of select bays or at the mouths of rivers. The preferred method of fishing at this time of year is dead bait. We've taken large suckers, chubs and this year lake herring. All with much success. Last year we caught about 12 pike 40"" or bigger. We also caught another 40-50 in the 36"" - 39"" range. You can also hit certain bays on warm days (spring Bay, Bullwhip, West Bay) and others with artificials. We have caught large pike on Johnson Silver minnows, Suicks, and spinners in very shallow water (1' - 2') when the weather is right. That is the story on pike. Walleye is a different story. If you want trophy walleye then Little Vermillion is not the lake for you. You can catch a lot of them. Last year my partner and I caught roughly 700-800 walleye for the week. Remember, we don't fish for walleye all the time. My partner caught a walleye on 24 straight casts at one point. They are a lot of fun. BUT the largest fish was 20"". Ask anyone who goes up there on a regular basis and they'll tell you it's not a trophy walleye lake . It's not even close. Once in a while someone pulls a 7 lber. In my seven years up there, catching thousands of walleye, my largest is 23"". We go to Sportsman's Lodge. Not sure if that's where you are thinking of going. Owned by Brett Geary. I think Brett's a nice guy. Some people don't think he's really friendly. Brett doesn't baby his guests. They bring you in. Give you your cabin. If you need something you ask for it. He doesn't visit you everyday and ask you how everything is. Most people who are regular guests like it that way. Cabins are basic but clean and warm. Toilet and sink in each cabin with central showers. Showers are clean and the water is hot. There are also no hidden cost. I believe it's $700.00 for the week this year. Includes flight in, cabin, boat and gas. Food is extra. Never been charged extra except for milk that we bought through them. Boats are 16' with 15 h.p. 4-stroke Hondas. It would be nice to have bigger engines but they are fine for the size of the lake. I'll try to answer any questions you may have. I have no connection to Sportsman's lodge except as a customer Bellcon"
546799,Guest,2005-04-05 17:50:00,0,I can confirm things - the Fireside Lodge relates to the Little Vermillion in the Sioux Look-Out area - there is also a Little Vermillion near Red Lake - different ones - Fireside Lodge told me in fact after I asked as it seemed confusing - I knew about the Red Lake one - Little Vermillion near Red Lake I believe is fly-in - hope this helps - Larry
546800,Guest,2005-04-05 17:59:00,0,Additionally can someone list a web-site for Sportsman's Lodge and / or a phone number - thanks - Larry
546867,Guest,2005-04-07 13:15:00,0,"Bob - Depending where you are in Indiana - I can give you a map and where to fish, and what to use. As been stated before, you will have a very good time and catch the biggest pike in your life, as well as catching many walleye. You can email be at dbr6@aol"

546623,Guest,2005-03-27 17:41:00,0,"I'm also planning a trip to the Fireside Lodge this August. Any information, fishing maps, and/or websites would be great. I've only heard very positive things about the fishing there. I'm looking forward to the trip. Thanks in advance. Mark."
546627,Guest,2005-03-27 22:10:00,0,i have a cabin on Big V up the road and fish little v a couple time a year. june is great for muskie and smallies. they have a good sanctuary on one end that is all catch and release. i'll bet we caught 30 smallies in there last year from 10am to 2pm between 3 to 5lbs. give me an email if you need any help around town [email protected]
546655,Guest,2005-03-29 11:33:00,0,"I am pretty sure he is talking about Sportsmans lodge on little Vermillion, its the only camp on the lake. North of Red lake, access only by plane in summer and snowmobile in winter."
546660,Guest,2005-03-29 14:36:00,0,"Hey Bryan I don't think you are suppose to fish in a fish sanctuary, not even catch & release."
546668,Guest,2005-03-29 18:18:00,0,"I'll be at the Fireside Lodge on Little Vermillion Lake the third week of August. It's the only camp on the lake if you believe the adds. the muskie fishing is supposed to be very good. I'm a bass and pike fisherman, never catch a muskie. I've been told this is the place to do so.Bbaker, i'll follow you up on your offer, Thanks. Mark.http://www.firesidelodge.com/"
546685,Bryan Baker,2005-03-30 04:58:00,6,"sancuarieS, plural that is, there are about three in the chain, opened back up about 5 years ago. single barbless hook only, catch and release. we used tube jigs and i had one rookie using some god awful ugly beetle spin to clean up on the smallies. i want to say the name of them was ""maskontonge"" or something like that. you have to go through about 2 miles of winedy beaver canal and the mouth of it going in is a good muskie spot and the water has to be high enough or else it is too shallow to get a big boat through. but it is worth it and if you can bring a conoe there is about a 100 yard portage up a hill off the last one. i have never fished it as i drag a bass boat through that mess but hear it is good too. there is another lake off little V to the south west that only has about 200 yards of canal to get through. it is pretty hidden. we have fished it a couple times and rose some big logs, but no takers. there is a cabin back there where if you get there the right time of the year, the chicks swim naked off a platform they drag into the lake. nothing to write home about but beats looking at the grundgy dude next to me."
546773,Renn,2005-04-04 13:22:00,87,"I believe there are (at least) two Little Vermilion Lakes on Ontario. The Little Lake Vermilion just north of Sioux Lookout is the location of Fireside Lodge. The Little Lake Vermilion north of Red Lake is the location of Sportsman's Lodge. I believe this is the lake the original poster is refering to. Although, I have not fished either Little Vermilion's, I have heard there are some monster Northern in Little Vermilion near Red Lake. Some pushing 50 inches. If it is anything like the rest of the lakes in the Chikuni chain, the water is very stained and the weed growth will end at about 8-10 feet. Renn"
