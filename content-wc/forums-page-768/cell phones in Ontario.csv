546826,Guest,2005-04-06 08:06:00,0,What about ON-STAR from my vehicle? About 20 miles north of Vermilion Bay?
546827,Guest,2005-04-06 08:16:00,0,My On-Star phone worked beyond the northern parts of Cabonga Res.

I do have a cell phone here, it does not work as soon as I cross the border. I thought about getting a phone in Ontario, but....can I call back to the states???? Thanks, Brad"
546830,Fishoil,2005-04-06 11:18:00,1277,"My cell phone works great in Canada, but you have to set it up properly. As soon as I get near the border I hit the off button. After crossing the border I put it in the glove compartment. It then works great.... never rings during the whole trip. :-)"
546834,Wordly traveller,2005-04-06 12:40:00,9,"For fly-outs a cell phone probably won't work. I haven't tried a satellite phone but our fly-out does not have radio contact so I am considering renting one for the week. Here's a link to a provider that's not that expensive:www.gpsphones.com/rentals.htm If anyone's tried one of these, how about posting some information for the rest of us. Thanks.

546843,Guest,2005-04-06 14:48:00,0,"In terms of regular cell service there is service in RedcLake if you have a duel mode (Digital / Analog) it will work. If you have a single mode you need Analog. (Generally older cells work better...this is as of last June. Maybe they have upgraded service.... As for Satellite phones I have rented one the last 4 years. They work very well. Absolutely amazing to stand and watch the Northern lights while talking to the spouse at home. You can get an easy 2 hours of talk time min (I have never come close to killing a battery, but I rent an extra as it usually only costs $5-$10 a day for the extra battery) I do recommend shutting the thing down during the day to conserve battery power over the week. If someone needs to reach you, they can leave a message which you can retrieve from the phone. About the only negative is cost which will run between $40 for the week plus minutes and the fact you need a relatively clear view of the sky for the phone to work. Service indoors without an external ant will not work. I have used Satellite Outfitters. I normally rent the bigger bulky (but cheaper) GSP 1600. They are running $39 a week plus about $2 p/min.http://www.outfittersatellite.com/rentals.htm Bobby"
546804,wiggle,2005-04-05 19:05:00,400,"I was wondering if there was anyone here, from Minnesota or Wisconsin or Michigan, that fishes Ontario and can make calls on your cell phone back to the states while fishing in Ontario. If so, who is your provider? I was thinking about getting one of those cell phones where you just buy time and use it as you need it and not get hooked up to any certain company or plan. Does anyone else do that? Any information would be greatly appreciated. thanks, Brad"
546806,Pooch,2005-04-05 19:27:00,4619,"My experience has been that Verizon (digital) phones work in most of the medium to large towns. Don't plan on driving out of town and still be talking 'cause it won't happen. Thunder Bay, International Falls, Dryden, Red Lake and some of the towns in between have cell sites. I think I had a signal at Ignace but north of there is nothing. Nothing at Savant. I don't know about Pickle. Going west after International Falls, decent coverage once you get near LOW area. Once your out of town there usually is no signal. Every year there seems to be more coverage. Try your providers web site for coverage. Some of my buddies phones were DOA up and back until they hit the border. Pooch"
546807,BigThunder,2005-04-05 19:52:00,17,"my verizon phone works in Sioux Lookout. Not the best reception, little bit of static, but I can make and receive calls"
546808,Guest,2005-04-05 20:10:00,0,"My Verison phone worked on LOTW. We stay at a boat in lodge to the north of the lake and it worked there. It was analog service, no ditigal on the lake where we stayed. One guy had Sprint and another had Nextel and neither worked, but that was probably due to the analog signal. It's runs your battery fast and was .69 cents a minute but there is no other phones accessible to us where we stay. Brett"
546809,2 DOGS,2005-04-05 20:14:00,361,We have Verizon and pay an extra $10 a month for the time we're in Canda and have good coverage in Ear Falls.
546811,Guest,2005-04-05 20:31:00,0,"I have a story about cell phones in Canada. I fish at a boat in camp on wine lake, which is 22 miles from the landing on Wabaskang. While there last year a young male with one of those fancy flip phones with a camera that cost about $150 or more and uses digital didn't work anywhere on the lake or in the cabin and there was a tower close by. I had an old analog phone with verizon and I sat in the cabin and could call anywhere. So it is better off to have an analog phone. I wouldn't use a tracphone because you will use up a lot of minutes."
546817,Eyesore,2005-04-06 01:04:00,455,My wifes did not work while we were north of Sioux Lookout. Thats the beauty of this is. Not taking it in the first place would have been my first option. I would'nt want all those #### calls while trying to enjoy some fishing.
546819,Bryan Baker,2005-04-06 05:01:00,6,"i hooked up a land line at our cabin in sioux lookout for emergency once we got kids. 1 year later they deployed cell towers. i use the land line with prepaid phone cards bought at the grocery store in sioux for the cheapest rate, but for emergency i keep the cell around. the other posts are consistant with what i use: verizon, it is analog service so it sucks your battery quick, and it runs about .69 cpm."
546821,Guest,2005-04-06 06:41:00,0,"I use US Cellular. I called home from Sioux Lookout without problems. I think your best bet is a ""tri-mode"" phone. Those seem to work in areas that regular digital single-mode phones don't. Bander6"
546822,Trophymuskie,2005-04-06 06:41:00,254,"Since you do not own a cell phone already and you are planning on buying minutes. Why don't you find out what Canadian service works best for the area you will be fishing and then figure out what american company cell phones are compatible then all you need to do is buy minutes in a store here in Ontario.
