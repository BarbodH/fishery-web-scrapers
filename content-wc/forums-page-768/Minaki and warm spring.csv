I got the scoop on fishing smallmouths in mid 40's water temps, but perhaps this new knowledge won't be needed, hopefully. We will see if the crappie will cooperate. They sure are biting here in Tennessee. Some walleye shallow would finish off a great trip, perhaps with an incidental bonus muskie on smallmouth tackle. Hope everyone has a great time this year, Don"
