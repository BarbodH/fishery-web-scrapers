546721,Guest,2005-03-31 19:52:00,0,Talked to Ron and Nancy at Snake Falls on Pakwash a couple months ago and they said they only had about 20 inches of ice because of heavy winter snows. Wondering if anyone else knows how much ice has to melt this year to open the area lakes. Forcast looks promising for ealy ice out this spring. Any info appreciated.
546729,Guest,2005-04-01 08:42:00,0,I fish out of Ciancis on Pakwash. We should be in for a good season. The opener is a little later this year. Last year it was early and we had some days of tough fishing.

546820,Guest,2005-04-06 06:32:00,0,"It's definately worth it. This will be my 10th year in a row. Last year was a little tough but fishing improved during the week. One spot you'll want to try for Walleye is the mouth of the river. You'll see the Trout River on the map were it enters Pakwash is a very good and popular spot. Lots of current anywhere from 8 to 20 foot deep. We generally just verticle jig. Some guys troll or drift. I stay at Ciancis which is on the Trout River in between Pakwash and Bruce Lakes. Bruce Lake is pretty shallow but does have a quite a few spots. Its a pretty good ride in the boat. It gets rough so we wait for a nice day to head up. Pike fishing has been incredible since they set the slot limits. Last year my dad caught a 43"". We caught a 40"" and several between 35""-39'. A good spot for Pike is ""Highline Bay"" its on the map as well and the owner at your camp will know. I've heard the cabins at Snake Falls are really nice.
