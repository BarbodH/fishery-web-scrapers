546726,Chrispy,2005-04-01 07:27:00,2,I have been fishing for walleye for years but have never ventured down the Detroit River....I'm looking for any info on where to start...I was going to start near the bridge and work my way towards Lake Erie....I will be jigging and/or bottom bouncing with a worm harness...thanks for any info!!! Chrispy!

If you spend some time out on the water you will start to see spots that have boats every time you pass, there are a bunch of spots on the Canadian side with less pressure, less snags and lots of fish."
546772,Guest,2005-04-04 13:18:00,0,Thanks Paul...I think I'm going to start near the salt mine and work my way down towards Peche Island (River mouth)....Hopefully get out this weekend now that the ice is gone...thanks again!! Chrispy!
