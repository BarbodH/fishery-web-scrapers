546699,Trailerguy,2005-03-30 18:37:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Boiling water will kill the Giardiasis and Cryptosporidium cysts, which are about .5 micron in size, as well as bacteria. But it won't purify the polluted or chemically contaminated water. They claim a 2 cycle engine dumps about 25% of it's fuel unburned into the lake, MBTE a gasoline additive goes right into the water in that way. Filtration can remove virtually everything."
546710,Guest,2005-03-31 10:48:00,0,"Although we were having a little fun with the term ""Beaver Fever"" Can someone tell us non Canadians what that is.....sounds serious. Also, what was the problem at Walkerton that was referred to? I know the owner of the camp we stay at on Gullrock complains bitterly about the ""moving"" regs on water quality and the money it costs him."
546713,Trailerguy,2005-03-31 13:20:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]""Beaver Fever"" is a common term used to descibe the illness caused by Giardiasis Cysts. They are a hard shelled worm like creature that commonly inhabit the intestines of warm blooded creatures. In higher consentrations they cause a flu like illness that can be fatal, espescaily for immune weakened individuals. When feces gets in the water, (typical for beaver), the cysts travel to their next host. A few years ago in Walkerton the water treatment plant was not working properly and Giardiasis got into the town's drinking water, resulting in a number of deaths and alot of illness."
546714,Guest,2005-03-31 13:30:00,0,Thanks! No wonder it's a hot political issue....particularly for fishing camps that deal with the public.
546762,Ohio fisherman,2005-04-03 15:49:00,989,"Thanks to everyone for their input. I ordered and just received a filter which should take care of the problem. However, we are also going to boil the water for the person with rheumatoid arthritis which is an immune problem. Further, the medicine to treat the problem further suppresses the immune system, which causes great risk of death or worse from Giardia. I believe that the more common form of ""Beaver Fever"" is a condition that infects all males between the ages of about 12 thru 92! thanks again and take care guys."
546771,jigman 2003,2005-04-04 13:05:00,981,"Anybody have input on the water pitchers with filtration elements? I have used one for several years now with no problems, but am wondering what it might be missing. They are supposed to remove bacteria, some viruses and most pollutants. Let me know your input."
546840,Guest,2005-04-06 13:27:00,0,"Where are you going specifically? Have you asked the tourist camp operator what they have for potable water. Have you told them about your friend's condition. Most either have a purification system or provide bottled water. You might be able to save yourself the hassle of bringing your own ""filtration system"". Simply ask the question."
546571,Thumper,2005-03-26 20:44:00,133,"I bought a water purifier a few years ago, from (I think) First Systems. It works great. A purifier will kill most viruses plus filter out parasites and contaminates. I works by pumping, OR by gravity. On our fly-ins I'll bring up a couple of empty 1-gallon jugs and fill one with gravity while the other site in the fridge. I think that First Systems was bought out by Katadyn 2 years ago. A purifier would be safer than just a filter."

546661,Guest,2005-03-29 14:51:00,0,"I don't know where you are going, and I don't know about other provinces, but lodges in Ontario now have to have water filters to a particular safety rating. This is from the growing concern since the Walkerton tragedy down south. In truth, I am sure the water in front of the lodge I am associated with on Lac Seul is just as clean to drink now as it was five years ago, or several years ago for that matter. The policy-makers have had to play the political fiddle since Walkerton with regard to clean water. The fact is, many lodge owners are being overwhelmed now by the costs associated with the newly required filters. Some spent several thousand only a few years ago to find out now (because of increased regulations, again) their products are not good enough, and will have to replace again."
546694,VMS,2005-03-30 13:39:00,1103,"You can purify all the water you want without a filter system. Just boil it. By boiling it for about 2 - 3 minutes, you kill all of the contaminants in the water, then just let it cool. You are all set, and you are safe. Steve"

In all of the years past, at many camps all over canada and alaska we just drank the water with no health problems. However, because of a serious medical health issue for one of people on the trip, I need to make sure the the water is filtered or purified somehow. We were thinking of a Brita pitcher or maybe a backpacking water filter. Does anyone else do this? If so, what do you do? Because of the long boat trip in we have limited room and weight capacity to take in drinking water. And yes, one alternative is to just drink beer because it comes already filtered in nice serving size cans - however the person in question doesn't drink. Thanks, O F"
