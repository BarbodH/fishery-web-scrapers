I AM TAKING A GROUP INCLUDING MY TWO SONS AGES 12 & 14 AND ANOTHER BOY WHO IS 12... THEY HAVE BOTH BEEN TO CANADA BEFORE BUT WE DONT HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH THE WALLEYE. I AM HOPING THAT A SHALLOW LAKE MAY BENEFIT US AND OUR INEXPERIENCE. HAVE YOU EVER BEEN THERE AT THAT TIME OF YEAR? I UNDERSTAND THAT IT DEPENDS ON ICE OUT , BUT I FIGURE WE STILL MAY BE ABLE TO GET ON THE WALLEYE AND PIKE PRETTY WELL? ANY INFO ON THE RATHOUSE RIVER OR NUNGESSER RIVER? ARE THERE A LOT OF NUMBERS OF PIKE ? I AM SURE THE BOYS AND I WILL BE THROWING SIVER MINNOWS AND OTHER SPOONS AS WELL AS SPINNERS, ETC.... OUR GROUP HAS 7 TOTAL. ME AND ONE OTHER GUY HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE (10 TRIPS EACH) BUT WE REALLY WANT THE NEW GUYS AND ESPECIALLY THE BOYS TO HAVE A BALL. ANY FURTHER INFO WOULD BE GREAT. THANKS AND FEEL FREE TO EMAIL ME AS MUCH AS YOU WANT...I LOVE TALKING ABOUT CANADIAN FISHING! BOB"
