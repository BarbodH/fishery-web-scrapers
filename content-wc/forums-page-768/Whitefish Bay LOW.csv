Dan.. What area of >Sabaskong do you frequent and what time of the year?? We go up in early June and fish out of Milie's. Our group is after smallies. We fish all over Sabaskong, and we also make trips to the west. Have gone to Basil Channel but it hasn't been all that good in the last few years. When do you go up? Dan"
546626,Guest,2005-03-27 20:51:00,0,"Dan; We head up at the same time and fish out of Red Deer Lodge which is 4-4.5 miles north of Nestor and then head out for areas around Hay Island and Stoney Bay, but I have been looking to pick up a new Sonar with Gps, so that I can head out to bigger water without fear of cracking a rock and not being able to get back being so far from ""home"".. Eric"
546629,Dan55,2005-03-27 22:41:00,7,"Eric, You certainly don't want to be moving around in Sabaskong without a GPS and a good map! Too many rocks at water level. Drop me an e-mail sometime if you want to compare notes. Dan"
546652,Guest,2005-03-29 08:19:00,0,"Depending on water temps you will find a majority of the walleyes in 10-25 ft.The thing with Whitefish is that you usually catch northern along with walleyes some times, it is a deep clear area.The reefs on the west side of Bell Island can be very productive.Where are you staying may help you with other spots.

546742,Guest,2005-04-01 22:36:00,0,"Dan...sorry to hear about your buddies father's condition...but kudos to you guys on planning the trip. The father-son fishing thing builds bonds that make lifetime memories. My fondest memories of my fathers time were trips he took with me and my brother and the fun we had. Good posts/info from others. My son and I are ""Sabaskongers"" as well..usually in Aug musky hunting. We have looked at Whitefish Bay for day trip adventure ideas...but the Turtle Portage has always been an obstacle (it sounds like a tough pull across the trolley for a Ranger 620...maybe others have done it with same/larger boats and can convince me it can be done ???). As an alternative to the portage, there are numerous Sioux Narrows area resorts that get you W-bay access without the portage if that is your goal. From S-skong, we have learned Yellow Girl and Miles Bay become best bets for consistent eye action in late summer....as LOTW eyes seek the 25+ water depths and suspend in deep water or set up on top of reefs coming out of deep water... and obviously lots deep water in Whitefish. Good luck on your trip !"

546525,Dan55,2005-03-24 19:37:00,7,"I'm new to the forum and need some assistance. For a few years I've fished the Sabaskong Bay area of Lake of the Woods. But, my friend and his 80 year old dad are heading to Whitefish Bay LOW in mid July near Sioux Narrows. I don't know the area and need some advice about finding fish in that area during July and techniques. His dad suffers from macular degeneration and this will probably be his last hurrah for a fishing trip. I understand the water in Whitefish is clear and deep. I'm assuming the best approach for them, due to the macular degeneration, is to jig for Walleye over deep reefs. His dad wouldn't need to worry too much about casting accuracy and could feel the bite. Am I on target at all? I'd appreciate any advice anyone may have. Thanks, Dan"
546530,Guest,2005-03-25 05:27:00,0,"Hey Dan; I've mainly fished Sabaskong too, but we always go into Whitefish via Turtle Portage where the MNR has set up sort of a trolley system for your boat, would not recommend it for an 80 yr. old, it's a pretty good work out cranking your boat over the rollers, Back to your question, I've was always under the impression that Whitefish only held Northern,Muskie and Lake Trout but then maybe I'm all wet.. Eric"
546531,Guest,2005-03-25 05:58:00,0,Whitefish Bay has eyes and they're usaully nice size but tough to get. I only fish down there if it's windy or dark/cloudy. My best luck has been b.bouncing around the reefs anywhere from 6-40'. If you head north approx. 6-10 miles you'll be in Long Bay or Yellow Girl. The fishing will be much better up that way.
546533,MN_Moose,2005-03-25 06:45:00,965,"Most spots are seasonal. You might try just east (s.e.) of channell island. The reefs in cludy overcast days. Jigging would work well, but start out trying bottom bouncing."
546585,doc,2005-03-25 11:15:00,143,I second the Yellow Girl bay option for walleyes. The clear water in Whitefish makes it tough for walleyes. It does have some great bass fishing. E-mail me if you want some spots to try up in Yellow girl area. Doc

546613,Guest,2005-03-27 07:04:00,0,"if you are looking for walleye in july on whitefish bay you better look shallow ,,,,, 5-20 feet they usually move onto the reefs and rockpiles about that time depending on the season .... i would not stay to the east side though as they fish the crap out of them reefs for nothing ,,,,,there is too much deep water around ,,(100-250 feet ) not exactly walleye water ,,, use your depth finder to locate fish on top of shallower humps ,,, and use your head to think of where the walleye are going to be,,,, use your map ,,,,just remmember in that real clear water if you catch a couple of fish ,,trust your depth finder when it says there are no more fish there ,,and move around,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, homework continues in real life !!!!!!! also don't be afraid to go and find a guide to talk to ,,,it might cost you a beer or 3 but it will be worth it ,,,,,"
