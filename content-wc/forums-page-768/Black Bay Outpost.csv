546798,IA  DAN,2005-04-05 17:29:00,53,I was just wondering how many users of this board stay up at Lac Seul at BlackBay.What weeks your there?How many years have you been staying there? For our group it will be the 10th yr. my 6th.For some mysterious reason our week was moved back aweek.We have always gone the last week of July now were told we have the 1st week in August.We were told it had to do with opening Walleye season being moved back but I think someone is blowing smoke up our axxxxes.Oh well we will still enjoy our stay up there as the fishing is to good to be true.I guess returning customers dont mean as much as it use to.At least we were all able to change our vacations before the deadline at work. Catch and Release the Big Ones so somebody else has a chance to catch there DREAM FISH.

I think most camps figure their schedule by week 1, 2, 3, etc. Week 1 would be opening week, which could start as early as May 15th (last year) or as late as May 21st. This year you have to wait an extra week before fishing up on the Seul."

546877,Rich J,2005-04-07 21:49:00,65,"2 DOGS Nah, I'm not waiting, 39 more days. I do hope the weather is better than last year though. Are you waiting until after Memorial day? Rich J"
546879,2 DOGS,2005-04-08 01:30:00,361,"Rich, looks to be around June 3-4 for us. Not that I'm not anxious, definately I'm not ready! Plus, the prettier half of this dynamic duo has a vivid memory of snow, ice, rain and cold on many of the openers and no amount of sweettalking seems to be working. I guess I'm losing my touch, I've used the ""well, you'll have a full windshield this time so it'll be alot warmer"" so much I don't even get the dirty looks anymore. I suppose I could always threaten to get a new fishing partner but with my luck, she'd end up with the boat in the settlement! For sure I don't need the work or brain damage of rigging another boat. I suppose one should be thankful for 3 months of fishing instead of 3 1/2. See ya in August."
546881,515,2005-04-08 06:18:00,254,2 Dogs nailed it. Its just a late opener for us this year. Just the way the calender falls and most camps do the booking by the week and then fit it into the dates as they fall. Hope you have a great trip up this year and catch lots of fish. Mike
546883,Guest,2005-04-08 07:12:00,0,2 Dogs Did you get a boat? Send me an e-mail and tell me about it. I'll be up the second week in June. I have to get those kids sent home for the summer first.
546885,Guest,2005-04-08 07:42:00,0,Started going to Black Bay before Dan owned it. This year will be our 17th I think. Dan has done a great job over the years of improving it. You are not getting smoked....your week is based on number of weeks from opening not calender weeks.
