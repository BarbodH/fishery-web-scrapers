We are a group of 4 looking for walleye in numbers with the possibility of a larger pike. Some places that we are considering are Club-fontbrune on lake Piscatasine, Domaine Forsythe on lac Attic, Pourvoirie Hurtubise on Maude lake and Suzy lake outfitter. Anyone have any experience with any of these lakes? Or willing to suggest a similar place to go for a week. We are looking at the second week of the season. thanks alot guys jale6666"
