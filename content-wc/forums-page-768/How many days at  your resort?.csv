546766,Guest,2005-04-04 06:39:00,0,We also fish the opener. We arrive at our camp Fri night. We fish through Thursday. We leave on Fri around Mid. Traffic is alot lighter for us when we leave Fri. If we have really bad weather we would fish Fri too.

546056,Guest,2005-03-04 13:36:00,0,"I used to go to a camp that restricted check-in to Sat. a.m. and had to leave by 8 a.m the next Sat. We wasted all day Fri. driving up there, had to stay at a motel Fri. night, then only got a half day fishing on Sat. because it was afternoon by the time we got settled in and out on the water. The following Fri. was cut short too because they wanted the boats back by 5 p.m. so they could get them ready for the guests arriving Sat a.m. The camp I go to now lets us arrive and leave when we want. We arrive Fri. evening and don't leave until nine days later, on Sun. a.m. We do that trip in July and again in Oct. It's a lot more relaxing and we don't feel like we have to fish every minute of the day."

546057,Guest,2005-03-04 14:33:00,0,"We're going up June 18-24. I hope to hit McEwan this year as well as Kawaweogama. I believe that the water will be up again this year. Sioux Lookout has 3'-4' of snow on the ground still. High water is good for the boat props, but finding the fish is a little different. I'm just excited that the moon will finally be in our favor again (full moon on the 22nd). Anyway, enjoy your stay on Star and hope you can explore more of the lake this year."

546058,Guest,2005-03-04 15:09:00,0,6 days? i don't understand. you are still getting 6 1/2 days of fishing. they have just adjusted the start and finish time. they need at least a half day to clean cabins and maintain boats. i still consider the new schedule as a week of fishing.

546069,Guest,2005-03-06 19:23:00,0,"We are heading up to Gullrock Lake for the opener. Bill at Golden Hook Camp lets our group arrive a few days early because we are the first arrivals of the season, so we fish for northern. Free days are good, but for 8 days must buy a season license. We have friends that go later in the season, and they let them arrive late Friday night,this saves them a Hotel room, Start fishing Sat am & check out is Friday morning, works for us. Only 74 more days, we arrive on thursday."

546073,Guest,2005-03-03 15:06:00,0,"After going to a couple of shows I've noticed alot of camps are going to a 6 day package. Check in Saturday morning and check out by noon Friday. Seems like a good idea, you get an early start fishing on the first day when you're so anxious and by Friday, it's about time to go home and rest up from vacation."

546076,Guest,2005-03-03 18:03:00,0,"Back when I was a customer the first thing that turned me off was a 6 day package. Would check through lodges on the internet, if I had to leave Friday, on to the next lodge... If I wanted a weeks worth of fishing, by God I was going to get it. All the best, Agate"

546053,Guest,2005-03-04 10:11:00,0,"The lodge I go to allows us to pick and chose the number of days. Due to the travel time to get up there (about 15 hours from where I live), we have gone to 6 day trips. We drive up on Sat., getting in late, fish all day Sun through Fri, and leave early Sat. morning, getting back home after midnight on Sun. It works pretty well. There are disadvantages to such a short trip -- of course. A bad weather system can really cut into productive fishing time. Also, with a short trip, the tendancy is to feel you have to spend every waking minute fishing. All of the guys in my group, myself included, have wives and children at home, so a 2+ week trip is probably years off."

546054,Guest,2005-03-04 10:45:00,0,"Ditto. I travel 5 hours from West Virginia to Fort Wayne Indiana. I meet with my group there and then drive the 21 hours to Savant Lake (just north of Igace and northeast of Sioux Lookout). We leave Friday morning at about 8:00 and get to Rusty Myers at about 5:00 or 6:00 Saturday morning. We then fly to Allanwater Lodge. We settle in Saturday and fish that afternoon. We come home that following Friday. By the time I get back to WV on Saturday evening, I'm exhausted and need Sunday to recoup (usually by having some more cold ones on the Ohio River). 6 days is all I can squeeze in with a family and all. Barney and John at Allanwater price by the day and seem to have groups coming in at different parts of the weekend because of this. Allanwater is a nice camp and Kawaweogama has plenty of Walleye, but nothing monstrous. Several 16""-22"" fish with some larger ones caught on occassion. Barney has owned this camp for several years and his son, John, is up frequently for assistance. All in all, it is a good time and nice place.http://www.allanwater.com/main.html"
