6216368,mjayn,2018-07-02 14:37:00,1188,"You can find lots of research that show many doctors are changing their tune on traditional vegetable oils vs. saturated fats vs. medium chain fats(coconut oil).My cardiologist(young guy) straight up told me canola, corn, vegetable, etc oils are not the best choice. Coconut oil was the healthiest he knew of but sticking with solid oil(not crisco) was a good bet. Ghee was the next best. I make my own ghee and its great, but it gets expensive. These fats raise good cholesterol and are inherently anti-inflammatory. Plus coconut/ghee/lard it doesn't need refrigeration and have high smoke points. I like lard for trips because a couple of lbs takes up the same space as a medium size bible, tastes great and won't leak all over. Coconut oil would be my choice if it wasn't so expensive, it has a great taste as well(I get the refined kind that doesn't taste like coconuts, neutral flavor).Sugar is the devil, not real fat."

O'Doul's is a no-no. LMFAOJust remember, this WILL affect the flavor of the final product - which is why I suggest a white German dessert wine and not beer or hard liquor.Liquid should be deep enough to just cover a fillet.3 drops of liquid smoke3 drops of natural vanilla extracta couple of whole clovespinch of allspicepinch of saltpinch of lemon pepperpinch of garlic2 pinches of mustard seedsLow-temp sautee & stir slowly, to extract the spices with the alcohol & butter for 2-4 minutes.Add raw onions & mushrooms to make a bed for the fish & let simmer for 1 minute.Place fillets, spine-side down, on top of onion & mushroom bed. (Fillets should still be more than 1/2 to 3/4ths covered by liquid).Cover & slowly simmer down liquid until only the mushrooms & onion bed are still fully covered (5-7 minutes?), then flip fillets so onions and mushrooms end up on top of fillets & the skinned-side is down on the bare pan bottom & about 1/4 covered by liquid.Finish off with higher heat to evaporate off any remaining liquid & fully cook the other (skinless) side of fillets until they start to brown & stick.Fillets should flake apart easily, without being either soggy or dried out.Concurrently, there should be a 2nd pan with finely diced potato frying in a small amount of butter. Push around often to evenly cook & brown diced 'taters.Serve up fish & ""fries"" on pre-warmed plates with choice of beverage.The whole process takes about 1 hour, from start to serving (not counting fish filleting time).Done properly over an open fire, I GUARANTEE you'll never have eaten a better shore lunch.It does take some skill to set up a cook fire with controlled zones, if you don't have a grill surface to set the pans on.Once the fire is going and a set of coals develops, flatten them out to make an even cooking area large enough to accomodate the 2 frying pans.Periodically feed the fire with small twigs & sticks to regulate temperature & sustain coals.I prep two sets of three (1 inch dia.) ""sized"" sticks per pan, to set directly on the coals & elevate the pans, and replace them once if they char and burn through while cooking."

6218334,jackpotjohnny48,2018-07-07 13:08:00,153,"I'm jackpotjohnny and I approve this message! :-) On a more serious note, I am very genetically predisposed to heart disease on my dad's side of the family. One of my dad's brothers had a fatal heart attack at age 37, another brother had a fatal heart attack at age 38. My dad had his first heart attack at age 35, but was fortunate to be near medical help when the heart attack occurred. I actually had a heart attack at age 37 while working out on a treadmill. Fortunately, the people at the health club took very quick action to save my life. In any case, I have researched this issue quite a bit, and I am thoroughly convinced that sugar / refined foods are the real culprit - dietary saturated fat is not harmful at all in my opinion. For the first 37 years of my life, I NEVER intentionally ate an egg yolk - it was always egg whites only or egg beaters. Recipes were adjusted to remove the yolks. And yet I still had a heart attack which should have killed me. Since doing my research, I now eat about 4 egg yolks per day, and plenty of butter and coconut oil. I avoid all sugar, all soda, all fruit juice, all margarine (and other fake fats, including processed vegetable oils). Please don't interpret my post as my soap box sermon on what you should or shouldn't be eating. It's just that my family history / genetics has forced me to do some research. If I have done my research correctly (which admittedly is a big IF), I think that the lipid hypothesis, first postulated by Ancel Keys, is completely wrong. For those of you who don't have any genetic / health history reasons to make a dietary change, you very well might be able to get away with occasional dietary choices which are less than optimal. However, I don't think I personally have much room for error. That's why I have been sticking with more natural fats (butter and coconut oil), and avoiding man made fats and processed carbohydrates. I totally agree that ""sugar is the devil, not real fat."" ""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"

Louisiana Crispy, comes in a bag make sure you get the Fish formula. So simple to use and it fries up crispy thin coating great flavor. Clean fish rinse put in bag with breading and cook. Your hands don't get full of breading even bag isn't a sticky mess. Seems to be mostly a corn meal mixture. Bag is yellow."

Mix is a simple blend of flour, corn meal, Italian bread crumbs with garlic pepper, Cajun and Italian seasoning.. Mix adds a real light coating and you really get the taste of the walleye (or northern) filets.. Of course we sprinkle some lemon pepper on the fish as soon as they come out of the oil.. Getting hungry just typing this reply."
6215894,v-bay gord,2018-07-01 15:49:00,3168,I find your reference to that pre-80's flavor interesting. Back in the day (late 70's) when I guided at North Shore Lodge on Eagle Lake the standard shore lunch box contained one pound of lard. 99% went to the fish pan.....a dab into the potato pan (unless you were one of the native guides that liked it half and half..) It did taste different. I must give it a try sometime to see what that was all about. We now use Canola oil for our fish fry......but I do miss that pre -80's flavor. Thanks for the memory jog... ..
6215908,valley366,2018-07-01 16:25:00,193,"For oil we have been using different 1 gallon jugs you get at Fleet Farm. This last time I got one that was a blend of Soybean and Peanut oil. Have not really noticed a difference to be honest with you. We have a deep iron pan that holds about 3/4 of a gallon. For breading we use a recipe my dad taught me that has lasted the test of time. One gallon ziplock bag, crack an egg with a little bit of milk. Drop the fish in. In another one gallon bag is a 50/50 mix of corn flake crumbs and flower. Drop the fish in there for a coating and lay on plate. Fry as desired.Like previous have said I don't care for the high salt and all the spices type breading. Just something to add a little crunch.Have also used the above recipe on chicken strips. Comes out really good."
6215928,halfmoon007,2018-07-01 17:21:00,121,"Last few years we are really liking peanut oil in the turkey style fish fryer used outside. Can cook 2 batches walleye and 2 batches potatoes (fries) for 6 guys in about 12-15 min. This is a fly in and can get buy marginally with 1 gallon oil with a extra quart for back up. Fry oil pan fits in bottom of fridge when it cools and strain thru cheese cloth every 2 days. (6 days of frying) and the boys get huge batch of onion rings on the last day (they destroy the oil). Oil goes on the fire pit trash burn night before fly out We prepare fillets by flouring then egging and then coat with corn flake crumbs also some with Panko crumbs. Then a dose of Lawreys salt and coarse black pepper.For a change up we have used finely crushed pretzels, and in a bind have commandeered the special K breakfast cereal and crushed it up. Just a note on Brick lard, We used it for 20 years ( the boat in lodge supplied it) and it worked great and now after this thread would like to try it again LOL. Back then it was Cast iron pan sliced raw fries (with onion) and walleye cooked the same all in lard,(Eat until you cant walk) LOL. Thus the 14ft boat w/ 9.9 is way to small for us now big ole old timers LOL Tight lines all.................Halfmoon (camp cook)"

6214914,rockape,2018-06-29 07:25:00,215,"Peanut oil for sure. And it has to be in some kind of fryer. Pan only for shore lunch. Shore Lunch brand is mandatory. I usually use beer batter or regular. The Cajun is awesome too if you want some extra spice. Mix up the Shore Lunch with Canadian beer, preferably Blue. Coat the walleye fillets and fry to perfection! Using the fryer just flat out works better. We used to have a huge kettle, but we switched to some Bass Pro Shops fryer this year and it worked great."

A pound of lard is about 2 bucks and I need 2 pounds for my fryer. It lasts about 10 fryings if strained while warm and about 5 frys if you don.t clean it al all.My backup is coconut oil but its expensive. I will never fry with liquid oil again(if i can help it) solid fat gives it that pre-80s flavor that has been forgotten by most. And as it turns out solid oil is way better for you(per my cardiologist)."

6215150,port1042,2018-06-29 16:13:00,509,"About a 1/4 inch or so of Canola Oil in a standard ""no stick"" electric frying pan. Filets are lightly coated with Zatarain's Crispy Southern breading (We replaced ""Shore Lunch"" brand a few years ago). The oil is not reused but is properly recycled by our lodge. We're getting old and shore lunch is just too much hassle. Mostly we eat northern's in camp and usually eat fish (or any big meal) at noon. We buy ""Sportsman's Licenses"" and expect to take home a limit of walleyes and northern's. We follow the rules including releasing any walleye over 18"" (camp rule), pay strict attention to limits, release other big or small fish and keep only ""eaters"". 13 trips over the past 6 1/2 years and we've never talked to or been inspected by a warden. We have been questioned at the border crossing about fish but never inspected. We consider it a privilege, not a right, to fish Canadian waters and we thank our northern neighbors for that opportunity."

The smoke point is high enough and it's not expensive at all.On one of my previous trips, as we were sitting in the dining area and waiting for the plane to come in and pick us upI saw a guy with this jug of ""orange juice"". I was thinking, wth is this guy doing bringing in a jug of OJ? To each his own I thought. Eventually, I went up to him and asked him what's up with the jug? It was actually some type of special fish frying oil that he said it was the best and brings it on all his trips. For the life of me I can't remember the name of it though. I took a picture but can't find that either. It really looked like a jug of OJ. I think the label was blue and red."
6215272,jackpotjohnny48,2018-06-29 22:42:00,153,I use coconut oil because I think it's healthier. Otherwise I would probably use butter. (Since I think butter is also healthier than vegetable oils) I like breading the fish in Fryin' Magic.
