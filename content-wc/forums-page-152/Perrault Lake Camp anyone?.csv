6216538,team walleye,2018-07-02 22:17:00,336,I am thinking about booking here for next June. I have fished the lake every other year since 2003. I have stayed at Rocky Shore and Rainbow Point. Looking for a change up. Looks nice on the website. Who has stayed here and can give some opinions? Thanks!

Camp itself is nice for moving at your own pace. Boats and equipment are modern and in great working order. I have always upgraded to the Lund Impacts no experience with the ""stock"" camp boats. Cabins are typical north woods knotty pine interior that are clean and functional. PLC checks the important boxes for our group as we always have a satisfying stay."

Right at the top of the horseshoe and you can get to the East side of Perrault in just a few minutes up the channel. I haven't fished Perrault before, but I hear most of the good spots are on the East side. Then you have all of Cedar which seems to produce more and bigger fish. Best of Both Worlds! Ray and Kathi are great hosts. Everything you need is there."

The camp fish fry was a good way to meet the other people at the camp and ask about the hotspots, especially since it was our first time there. For September the first part of the week was warm and windy, kind of slow fishing, except for the 45-47 inch musky caught on 8lb test with jig minnow! Last couple of days the weather cooperated, cooler and cloudy, turned on walleye bite!. I would go back again!"
6217484,port1042,2018-07-05 06:18:00,509,We stay at Manotak but have friends who stay at Perraut Lake Camp the same week we are there. They have only good things to say about PLC and if we ever decided to try something different we'd probably try that. I know your familiar with the lake itself so it's just trying to find a good base. We like Manotak and have stayed there twice a year for the past 6 years. There is one special service we really like. They clean and freeze or deliver our fish to our cabin. I don't mind cleaning fish but it's a real luxury not to have to do that! Bragging and drinking a cold beer on the cabin deck is lot more fun.
