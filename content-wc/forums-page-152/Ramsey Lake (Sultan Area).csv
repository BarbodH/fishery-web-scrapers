I did make some searches and found some great information, but you can never have enough.3 of us will be island camping mid July for our first time.If anyone needs any information regarding Happy Day Lodge/Windermere Lake, I fished there for 10 years and I am willing to share.Thanks, Mike"

6213948,mtaz,2018-06-26 19:51:00,3,"Yeah, I hear ya. Unfortunately (or fortunately) we're teachers so weeks off are generally kept to summertime. We rely heavily on those Executioner tennis rackets. We fished Lake Windermere during the same time frame for years and always did well when others weren't but I think it was mostly because we knew where to go. We also never fished mornings or evenings, just daytime."

I like to think this takes you down into, what I call the main body of lake. 6-7 miles. when you get there look straight ahead, there are 2 big islands, the one on left is actually 2 islands with a small one making a very good, protected bay. Point is I've camped there since 1989.If nobody on it great place to camp and fish from.Not going there this year, actually going to Biscotasing to a lodge. We all are in our late 60s and older. Time to treat our selves to some sold roofs over our heads. Let me know how it turns out when you get back.Enjoy, Paul"

6214838,chris.brock,2018-06-28 21:36:00,112,Very interesting. Were you on Ramsey before the walleye were put in? How has the fishing been over the years?
6216370,northernbite,2018-07-02 14:44:00,1186,"The fishing has gone up and down over years. When I first went you rarely saw anybody except on weekends. The logging camp was at the village of Ramsey which is now gone.I know the lake well and still always find something new. A lot more day fishing people come in because they camp at landing. I really liked camping there but all of use have reached a point we need the creature comforts and lets face it it's a lot of work setting camp up for six.My advice is keep your group small. 3 is perfect. I believe walleyes where added in the 60's. It is for sure a walleye factory just by the small ones you catch.Let me know how it goes, Paul"
