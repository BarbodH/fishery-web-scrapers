So at 30 started fly ins again . 40 plus fly ins , canoe trips , fishing on our bear hunts . I am seeing larger walleye about any place I go . My questions is , is it just me thinking that ? Or am I a better walleye fisherman ( donâ€™t really think that at all) . What are you guys thoughts on the walleye size limits , helping the overall size ?? I think it must be ."

Remembering back to the 1940's as a kid, I caught many, many, many fish, but hardly anything approaching 5 pounds in LOW. The larger fish started showing up when the size restrictions were put in place, and the commercial netting licenses were bought out by the govt. (I believe the size restrictions followed later,after the cease netting policy.). Over netting is still a factor when it is not controlled. Also, the mindset of fishermen has slowly changed, where it used to be standard practice to keep the biggest and now most folks have bought into the practice of catch and release. As I had remarked in an earlier post some time ago, I still remember an old Lindner magazine article explaining why the chances of getting a 10 pound walleye were mighty slim, and today it is fairly common, so situations do change, and there has to be a reason.

6217490,Rondogpike,2018-07-05 06:32:00,24,"I agree with everything posted. When I first started fishing Canada we could keep 6 walleye and they could all be 30"" fish. Now my group all purchase conservation licenses and we never keep a fish over 18"" to eat in camp. Largest take home fish is 1 over 18"" and never larger than 20"". I'm sure everyone here has noticed fish size classes seem to school together. I have had mornings where I boated 75 walleye and never caught one under 16"" or over 20"". Three years ago we had 2 boats in the same area and all 4 of us caught walleye over 28"". We caught 6 fish in a matter of minutes and it was over but the excitement and photos are still with us."
