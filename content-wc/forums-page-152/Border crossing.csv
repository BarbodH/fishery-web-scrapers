6216408,maddogg,2018-07-02 16:13:00,178,Any problems bringing eggs or chicken across the border from Wisconsin. We leave in 12 days.
6216464,mr.crampster,2018-07-02 18:57:00,18,No problems.
6216468,Deer Lake 1,2018-07-02 19:02:00,12,Was on bus trip last week up there. They didn't even ask 50 guys what they were bringing into Canada. Every day is different. Give them a call they will tell you what is banned. Or their website.One of the buses coming back the week before was pulled into a game check 10 miles from border. By the time they were done ripping all the packages of fish open the dry ice was gone and their were many upset fishermen.No violations found. They were looking to see the amount of skin left on the fish and if it matched the label on the freezer paper. Not a very positive thing to encourage fishermen to comeback to your country.

Just the usual: Where you going & for how long Do you have any tobacco or alcohol Are there any gifts you are leaving in Canada A few years ago, the Canadian web site on crossing the border had poultry items from Indiana as still being on their prohibited list. I don't this is still the case, but just the same I made sure our poultry items were from other states just to be safe. Safe travels!"
6216624,tv4fish,2018-07-03 07:26:00,2694,"When we crossed a week ago last Sunday - I actually got the customs agent (a guy) to laugh out loud. After the usual questions were done - I said - ""After what our president said about your Prime Minister - I'm surprised that you still allow us to come in..........."""
6216800,Eyetimes,2018-07-03 12:23:00,193,He laughed because what Trump said was true. The prime ministers is a nut case. But either way a sense of humor is good. I wonder if Mega hats are banned?
6216886,alberta bum,2018-07-03 15:49:00,312,Those that live in glass houses.....
6216922,Stringbean,2018-07-03 16:57:00,279,I heard the same comments last year in camp just outside Red lake.
6216932,Eyetimes,2018-07-03 17:16:00,193,"Have lots of windows to clean? Fyi I don't agree with name calling our counter parts in the western world. But to be fair after the Peoplekind comment, it proves the guy is leaning toward the nutty side. I love Canada I don't know what i would do with out Poutine or Canadian beer."
6216950,v-bay gord,2018-07-03 17:52:00,3168,There is no one more a nut case than in your own back yard.
