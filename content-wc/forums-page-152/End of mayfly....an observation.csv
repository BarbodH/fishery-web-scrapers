Fish off humps are on. The shallower bite (8-14"") has not been as productive... ..but......as in other years the walleye are now behaving like pike. White spinner baits, musky plugs into the shallowa are producing some big walleye. Mid afternoon. I've seen it now many times over the past 25 years....thought that maybe someone else can figure out the pattern... Anyone else had this same pattern?"
