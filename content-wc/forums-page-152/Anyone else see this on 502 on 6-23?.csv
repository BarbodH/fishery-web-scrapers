6217866,IronDioPriest,2018-07-05 21:59:00,96,"Man, I LOVE the drive on 502. So scenic and wild. Gotta keep your eyes peeled for critters for sure, but that's always the case, especially when driving in any remote or rural area. That said, we always hit that stretch in mid-afternoon, so we skip the evening/nighttime danger. I did see the bull moose on 6/26, still bloated in the ditch."
6216720,Lake Wisconsin,2018-07-03 10:10:00,1960,"502 can be bad, but if you know this, and take your time, I find it no more dangerous than a northern WI road. Due to the fact I was up in Canada hunting a few years back, I knew we would be traveling this area in the dark. Something I very much try to avoid after a near miss with a moose when I was young. But with the sun setting much sooner in October than June, there was no other option. So in preparation, I added a light bar with LED's to my truck. By no means do I like the look (nothing against other that do, just not my style), I hid it in the grill of my truck. Now we have daylight during the night and I found a lot of critters much earlier than I would have."
6216846,Ricky Spanish,2018-07-03 14:19:00,1298,x10 for everything. 502 is one of the most beautiful drives I have taken.
6216858,Aspencreek,2018-07-03 14:51:00,2911,"502 IS one of the prettiest and scenic drives I have ever done. But you must be aware of certain things, there is no services for the 90 or so miles so be prepared, fill up with gas, snacks and soda/coffee and be ready for a pulp check stop to ""whatever"". Be prepared for wildlife (deer, moose, bear, wolf, and lynx, have encountered them all) around any bend, give yourself room in front while following and stay alert. If you are tired, get out of the drivers seat, have a conversation with who you are in the car with, stay alert! And GPS countdown in miles will help you stay on task. I know alot of guys will set the cruise, not me, up and down and around some of those curves are NOT designed for 60mph cruising. BTW, 90KMH or 50 MPH is what they will enforce. I was leading a line of vehicles going my usual 60-65 and yes I got the ticket, those that were following can all thank me now. If they are doing speed enforcement 90kph means exactly that, be aware. Get there safe and in one piece, no better way to ruin a vacation then hitting one of those rock walls or worse by trying to get there 5 minutes faster."
6217026,Pooch,2018-07-03 20:37:00,4618,"90 miles (or what ever) stop sign to stop sign on 502.In ""theory"":50 mph = 108 minutes60 mph = 90 minutesEighteen minutes seems like a lot, but really isn't. Unless I have to go #2.Pooch"
6217676,IAranger,2018-07-05 11:15:00,352,saw the same one on the 23rd
6217704,bigwalleye1,2018-07-05 12:28:00,2632,"...and, based on experience, you'd think they'd only enforce within some reasonable distance of town.... NOPE. I've seen them running radar 80 klicks north of Fort Frances....."
6217734,CMesserschmidt,2018-07-05 13:53:00,1006,I saw the same bull on the side of the road. If I would have been on the ball I would have pulled over and pulled the head. Would have made a good European mount. You can call the MNR and they will give you a tag for it.
6217784,Aspencreek,2018-07-05 16:59:00,2911,Exactly!!!! Mine was set up at the furthest south pulp check pull-off a good 50 klicks north of 11.
6217822,Pink Unicorn,2018-07-05 19:46:00,83,We must've been right near each other because we saw the same thing. My buddy has video- I will try to post. What a freaky accident. We deducted that he lost control with the trailer and somehow perched himself on the rock. Coming back we nearly hit a 1.5 y/o bull. Also had a sow with 2 cubs walking down the road along with several grouse families. 105 is much better! They need to widen the tree line on 502.

6216420,DaBirdman,2018-07-02 17:02:00,164,"Never been on 502 before, but will be traveling it in a month. What's the speed limit on that road?"
6216426,Carnhzkr,2018-07-02 17:22:00,964,"Speed limit is 80km = 50mph. The general traffic flow goes about 60. Don't let me scare you about driving 502. It's no more treacherous than any other road, in my opinion. It's just long and boring and other than several turn offs for pulp check, there's no place to stop. My only issue with the road is it seems to drag on forever. As others have mentioned, it's actually in really good shape right now, after several years of construction. The only poor conditions are in the outside track on the south bound lane. Depending on oncoming traffic, sometimes you have to drive over a few pot holes.The danger comes in because there are limited areas where you can safely pass and you will certainly get into a long caravan of trucks pulling boats. People get impatient and someone will inevitably try to pass when they shouldn't and people tend to follow too closely, making it difficult to dart back into line. The best strategy is to get into line and just ride it out (easy for me to say now that I'm back at home)."
6216442,NARDA 1,2018-07-02 17:54:00,636,Depending on where you are headed you could look into taking the 71. It offers cell service most if not all the way and also several places to stop. The 71 is West of Fort Frances and if you are headed to or through Vermilion Bay will add about 30 minutes to your trip.
6216460,rickn,2018-07-02 18:46:00,993,"The South end of 71, for about 20 miles, has a few substantial dips and wallows, when I hit the first one, I may have seen daylight under the trailer tires. I only was on it to the 615 turn off. Most were not marked."
6216478,DaBirdman,2018-07-02 19:22:00,164,"We are headed to Sioux Lookout. Looks like 71 would be a bit out of our way and that it might be better just to wait out the lines through the construction zones. I'm actually looking forward to the drive on 502. I've got to imagine it's pretty scenic? Either way, with each mile we travel further north, the better!"
6216486,valley366,2018-07-02 19:55:00,193,I like to move along and get to my destination like a lot of people. I usually set the cruise around 90km on that stretch of road. There are portions that you can see a good distance ahead and see if a car is ahead of you. I tend to back the cruise off a little if I am catching them. If they are driving at or below the speed limit I will find a safe zone and pass them.The over anxious ones mentioned above are usually the ones that end up about 3 cars behind the slow vehicle and get annoyed that the car directly behind the slow vehicle wont pass. They see an opening and slam it to the floor and try to pass 3 or more vehicles in one stretch.As far as a lane being out coming out of Fort Frances. I think this was the first year in about 10 years that there was not construction on that bridge. So not uncommon for most that it was limited to one lane.
6216606,tv4fish,2018-07-03 07:09:00,2694,"We came back on Sunday - always travel 502 - we did see the dead moose. We have had some ""close encounters"" with moose on that stretch. Every time I come up to a crest in a hill - I ""prepare"" myself to be ready to hit the brakes in case a moose is just over the hill.................."
6216634,Pooch,2018-07-03 07:52:00,4618,"What causes most highway accidents anywhere are folks that drive over the posted speed limit (and conditions) encountering folks who drive under the posted speed limit (and conditions). 502 is the poster child for this.Add in wild life and roadside stops for various reasons and you need to stay on your toes.The remoteness and lack of cell service makes it a road to just ""go with the flow"" and be a defensive driver on. For your and others well being. If you decide to just follow someone then fall back and leave room between vehicles for someone else to pass you safely. I'll follow another car/truck if they are doing the speed limit or a little over. (as long as conditions are good) Other than that, 502 is a pretty drive and a great place to make the switch from real life to vacation. It is where my brain makes the unconscious changeover to fishing mode.Keep in mind that 502 is not just for tourists, residents drive that road year around and I would imagine most of them are glad when travelers (interlopers?) like us are gone for the season. (I would be.....)Having said that, the stop sign on the north or south end of 502 is always a welcome site.Pooch"
6216642,rockape,2018-07-03 08:01:00,215,"Amen to that bridge being fixed! Don't ever swerve to miss an animal. Just hit it. Seriously. After I smashed that deer in Wisconsin, the insurance company said if you hit an animal, it falls under comprehensive. Lower deductible and no rise in cost. If you swerve, miss the animal, and smash into rocks or trees, that is collision. Higher deductible and your rates go up. Go figure..."
6216694,The tank,2018-07-03 09:40:00,340,502 is way better today than 35 years ago. But if im going with my boat ill go over to 71 if im going up 105. if im going north or east of Drydon ill take 502. If its raining or has been raining becarfull that is when the moose like walking the roads.
6215916,Carnhzkr,2018-07-01 16:37:00,964,"A lot has been written about 502 between Fort Frances and Dryden. I've often said that is my least favorite 2-hour stretch of my drive. I've seen the aftermath of a few very unfortunate accidents, but I saw a new one last Saturday, June 23rd. We had just begun heading north on 502, only a few miles past the S-curve / bridge over whatever body of water that is. We came around a curve and I saw some type of SUV which was smashed to heck, perched atop a granite embankment about 10 feet in the air on the right side of the hwy. Its front wheels were hanging off the edge as if it were teetering on the brink. The vehicle had been pulling some type of small flatbed trailer and there were about 6 guys standing around, apparently unhurt from what I could tell. They were all standing around smoking cigarettes and appeared to be waiting for a rescue vehicle. I would have stopped, but there were already two other vehicles that had stopped on the opposite side of the road. Our best guess was the SUV was heading south and the driver just went straight through the curve, into the ditch and up the granite embankment and came to rest just before plummeting over the edge. Aside from that, the road itself is in the best shape I've ever seen it, but be careful out there!"
6215992,btyreprich,2018-07-01 19:08:00,1067,"I hate driving on 502 and am more than willing to drive an extra 30 or so miles on Hwy 71. Did not see the accident you are describing but saw a very serious one several years ago. Traffics stopped in both directions on 502 due to an accident between a logging truck and another personal car south of Dryden. We saw a helicopter land and take away one of two people. For this reason and the way I've seen people drive on 502, we decided to avoid it al all costs. In our younger days when we'd drive straight through to Sioux Lookout, we'd drive on 502at night. With all the wildlife we'd see at night, I now realize just how dumb of an idea that really was. Whatever road you drive on, drive safely. The fish will be there when you arrive."
6216064,Rock Lobstar1,2018-07-01 23:23:00,134,I’m definitely not a fan of highway 502. There is a looong stretch with no cell service so if you happen to crash you’re gonna have to wait for another vehicle to come along and find you and then wait for them to drive to where there’s cell service and then wait for the emergency vehicles to arrive. If it happens at night it could be quite a while before another vehicle comes along.
6216096,wally28,2018-07-02 05:42:00,65,Saw a dead bull in the ditch on 6-23
6216110,Bakefish,2018-07-02 06:12:00,1077,I love 502. That's the real Canada.
6216118,Carnhzkr,2018-07-02 06:50:00,964,"I saw that too. Hate to see something like that. It had velvet on its antlers. Looked to be pretty fresh when I saw it at around 9:30. On the drive home on 6/30, we saw a bear cub at one of the pulp check pull outs. He was fully alive and super cute, thankfully."
6216166,rockape,2018-07-02 08:33:00,215,"We used to do the same thing in our younger days too. We left a lodge on Cedar Lake at like 10pm on a Friday night to get a jump on our drive home about 5 years ago. We went back to the same lodge the next year, and the owner told us how stupid we were for driving on the 105 and 502 at night. He scared the $#@! out of me enough that we don't do that anymore. I did hit a deer head on at 70mph at 1:30am in northern Wisconsin 3 years ago. Talk about a horrible event that was a month long pain in the @$$. I can't imagine hitting a moose at 70mph. We make sure all of our driving in Canada is done during daylight hours now. I tell you what, this year, we did a Wednesday to Wednesday trip so our entire group could fish a whole week together. Talk about easy border crossings and zero traffic on the 502! Saturday mornings on the 502 are mega dangerous. I'm amazed there aren't more wrecks with people pulling boats driving way too fast."
6216394,UKBDM,2018-07-02 15:32:00,178,Figured that it happened like you said or he swerved to avoid a critter and somehow found the path that he traveled before getting perched on the ledge. Could have been much worse!
6216396,Carnhzkr,2018-07-02 15:39:00,964,"Agreed. We kept telling ourselves it could have been much worse. The granite embankment he hit happened to be sloped so the SUV went up like it was a rough rocky ramp, rather than a rock wall."
6216412,valley366,2018-07-02 16:39:00,193,Several years ago we were traveling north and came to a backup of cars. Similar type one vehicle accident as you discussed. Only difference was this one they hit the face of granite. From the looks of the SUV they had the back loaded up pretty good and everything in the back went to the front. In that case we did see an ambulance racing south before we go to the accident so it happened a good time before we got there.Not the type road that you want to venture off road at any point. Most times if you see a critter in the road have to fight the instinct to swerve. Just lock up the brakes and hope for the best.
