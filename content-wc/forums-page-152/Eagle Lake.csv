Mayfly hatch going strong and fishing was excellent. Any Bay that had weeds and mayfly hatch you could catch all you want on jig and minnow. From small to over slot. Fished weed edge toward deeper water, they were stacked up. Big walleyes were on humps. 26"" to 29"". Jig and minnow. Got some nice Jumbo Perch out of the weeds as well. Fished the Eastern part of Eagle. Had lots of bad storms roll through last week but fishing was excellent. Talked with a couple of guides that said Osborn Bay was unbelievable. You could catch all the shore lunch fish you wanted in 6' of water. We didn't need to go that far. Stayed around Temple Bay. Big Muskies were seen chasing walleyes out of water. No bugs. Sat out on deck of cabin each night enjoyed an adult beverage and had no mosquitoes. Took a video of a Lynx swimming across Viking Reef, was at least 1.5 miles from shore. The video is on my Ipad but I don't know how to post it.( Any help is appreciated)The old guides said that is a very rare thing to see."
