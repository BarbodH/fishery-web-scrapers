Water levels were low (1.5-2') but it rained hard twice while we were there. Mayflies were an issue in different areas of the lake through out the week and probably limited our overall numbers but not the size of fish we caught. Our group caught 5 walleye over 25"" with the best being a prehistoric 30"" caught by my nephew who was having a rough week up until that point. Jig/Grub/Crawler combo was best in 10-15' of water along weed edges. Weeds were a little behind schedule in some of our normal spots even though air/water temps were definitely above normal. Smallmouth were aggressive on topwater. We caught 6 over 18"" which is really good but not as good as it had been in last couple years. Many of our younger guys (18-22) have started to focus more on walleye. Biggest pike was 32"" caught while trolling for lake trout in 45' of water in Aerobus Bay. A guy in camp caught a 41"" and 43"" casting Sandcats/stickbaits just outside cabbage weeds with access to deep water. A couple lake trout over 30"" were caught in Aerobus Bay ... I would assume trolling as that boat trolled all week for all species. Big Mike is up there now for his second week so maybe he will chime in when he returns. Wabaskang continues to get better as a walleye fishery with many big fish and numbers. There is not a shortage of camps on the lake and boats on the water but we never have problems finding fish within 10 min of camp. We very rarely even fish past the 3rd narrows and really only go there with a west wind. If I buy a boat again some day or go again in the fall I'll probably spend more time on the Big Lake but for now have been very happy on the southern end. We did get checked in camp by MNR ... they went cabin to cabin. Had a dog on dock locating fish in livewells. Guy in our group had two over 18.1"" (18.5"" and 22"") and it cost him $180 Canadian. He could have said it was his dad's fish but told the truth and MNR guy was very professional. I have been preaching CPR on all fish over 18.1"" but part of our group not listening. Hope to see some other reports from Wabby guys!"

6216444,JAY221,2018-07-02 17:57:00,877,"Thank you very much for the report! Like you we seldom leave the mid to southern ends of the lake. I told the wife I would at least take her up to the big lake so she can say she has been there. We will be up there July 14th. Later, Jay"
6216698,Lake Wisconsin,2018-07-03 09:43:00,1960,"Thanks for the report. Been almost 10 years since I was up there last and brought back a lot of good memories. Get into any perch at all? I know there were years we would pound out our limit in 1 to 2 days, then focus on the pike and walleye. Never had a bad trip up there, but found the overall size of the fish to be small. Many in the 13-17"" range and a handful over the slot. Biggest I ever popped up there was a 26"". But really like the lake system - so much to offer. Can fish deep mid-lake humps, cabbage weed, shallow flats, on and on."
6217494,UKBDM,2018-07-05 06:42:00,178,"Occasionally in the middle of a hot sunny day a few guys will go after perch. I usually take a nap instead ... A couple guys in camp did come in one night with 15 jumbo perch. Nothing under 12"" and the biggest almost 15""!"
