Our group is looking for a new lodge for next years trip. Wish list is as follows 1. Drive to in Ontario so those of with boats can bring our own 2. REMOTE, for us its as much about seeing minimal people when out fishing as it is catching fish 3. Good fishing for the big two Walleye and Pike although we value the tranquility we still want to catch em 4. All fit in a cabin or two 5. Decent docks for our boats. Three generations on this trip so a few of the guys appreciate ease of getting in and out of boats 6. Not already booked. After my initial research on this board I contacted O Sullivans Rainbow thinking this was the place for us, very nice people to talk with but informed us that getting in in July or June would be a LONG shot. Fingers are crossed but...7. Clean cabins with a decent stove, fridge, and hot showers somewhere on the property. 8. What we don't want. WIFI, TV, Cell Service This is about unplugging, we don't want any temptations to connect. Last year I asked this board for a recommendation for our 1st Fly In experience. Got pointed to Slate Falls Outpost and could not have had a better experience, hope to get the same type of guidance one again."

6215142,nicko,2018-06-29 15:55:00,508,"Look at wiley point lodge. Everything you want.....secluded.....we see almost no one all week. No cell service, great docks, cabins, meals and great fishing not 10 min from the lodge. This year will be our 9th year....Great area....www.totemresorts.com"
6215516,drlee,2018-06-30 18:25:00,409,Take a look at Press Lake Lodge north of Ignace. Seems to me to fit your description pretty well. Contact me if more info needed.
6215956,Rich B,2018-07-01 18:15:00,1081,"Where are you leaving from, and how far are you willing to drive (just a one day 10-12 hour drive or a 2 day 20+ hour drive ?). Also, are you looking for the Spring Opener week, a June booking or looking for later summer ? Some lakes are better in the Spring and others fish better in the summer or Fall. There are excellent NW Ontario camps that would be great for your trip, though not sure how far you want to drive to get to camp and when your group wants to head north. Once you post a few more details, I'm sure you'll receive a number of excellent suggestions."
6216302,CowDoc75,2018-07-02 12:23:00,8,We start out in Southern WI and have traveled 800 miles in the past. We would like to keep it a one day trip up and back. Looking for something mid June to mid July
6216562,Guest,2018-07-03 04:58:00,0,"CowDoc, my son and I are just a little over 4 weeks away from our 9th trip to Black Bear Lodge on Red Lake. I'm sure that there are plenty of other great places to go, too, but we've never been given a reason to look anywhere else. Good fishing, good people, and remote (no cell service, etc.) -42"
6216638,pjshorthorn,2018-07-03 07:57:00,5654,"Ditto on this place. No kitchen and bathrooms in the cabin, but the shower house and a large outhouse are very adequate. Meals are provided in the lodge as part of the package and all that is asked is that everyone helps with a little KP duty after the meals. With a group your size, you could probably get the large cabin that is right on the lake with a great view and the fire pit in your front yard. PjShorthorn"
