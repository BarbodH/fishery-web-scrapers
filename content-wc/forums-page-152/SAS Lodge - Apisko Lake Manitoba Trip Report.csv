I thought I would do a trip report for those of you that might be interested. OK, I found Sas Lodge and the Outpost at Apisko Lake a very nice place to stay. The people and the staff at their aviation center as St Andrews airport were what I felt to be a top of the line operation. Bonnie Danard, their trip coordinator was wonderful to work with and will answer any and all questions courteously and professionally. They take their planes and their aviation record/operation very seriously and it shows. They fly Cessna Caravans, their planes can land on runways or water, and were very comfortable for our group of 4 that went. The aviation company North Way Aviation owns the Lodge and Outposts.The flight from St Andrews Airport, just north of Winnipeg into Apisko was right at 1 hour and 15 minutes. I liked the fact, though very early, that your flight in to Sas or Apisko leaves at 5 AM. Many other lodges cost you a half day of fishing just flying you in on the first day. We were there, at the lake and unloaded by 6:45 AM and ready to fish.The cabin was very nice in my opinion. It was built in 2004 and is modern with a Samsung 'Big' Fridge and Freezer, newer gas stove, chest freezer and WI FI in the cabins so that you could at least text family and friends if needed. The cabin utilizes a satellite phone for emergencies. The only complaint I had was the beds. The mattresses were twin in size but they built a wood frame to sit the mattresses on. However, it was fine and your not there to sleep all the time, you are there to fish. The cabin, I believe would sleep 8 comfortably and has a 3 piece bath with shower, sink and flush toilet and nice hot water to boot. They supply all the ice in the chest freezer, have a barbecue grill on the outside deck, and a outdoor fish fryer - which we found really nice to have. They have an endless supply of Canola oil as well for you to use.The cabin is solar with a diesel generator that you cannot even hear running when it kicks in. There are 110 V outlets in the cabin and we never had nothing short of full power to charge batteries, phones, etc. Interior lights always provided more than enough light - just like home. There is a fuel shed right next to the cabin with a wood plank walkway that extends all the way down to the dock. They keep 55 Gal. Drums of fuel on hand and you use a transfer pump to fuel up your tanks and take them back to your boat very easy and no arduous labor involved lugging cans back and forth for long distances. The shed also has plenty of nets - both regular and the rubberized type and plenty of life jackets on hand. Outside there is a fish cleaning table with a cutting board type surface and a full pressure water hose for rinsing and cleaning up. Worked great! There were a few boards on the walkway that needed replaced and a few deck boards as well on the porch but it appeared they already had the lumber there and were preparing to remedy the issues - nothing major at all!Their boats at the outpost and the lodge are nothing short of outstanding! 16'5 FT. Alumacraft Boats with three seat pods available, very nice cushioned seat and a fully textured/rubberized finish on the entire interior and floor of the boats. Boats have anchors, running lights, live wells, storage compartments bilge pumps and electric start 40 HP Yamaha motors with RPM reduction for extra slow trolling if needed. The boats were all brought in new in 2017. They also have a new dock facility with individual slips for each boat with side bumpers and have four fully equipped boats at the ready. We used just two of the boats and as mentioned they were GREAT to fish out of!!!As far as the lake is concerned, Apisko is a good sized lake and is fed by the Assipan River. It has quite a few islands and the traditional Manitoba rock and fir/pine/birch tree studded shoreline. The one thing I will say about Apisko is that it was pretty shallow in all areas we explored on the lake. The average depths we found were 0-8 ft. There may be some deeper holes but we did not find them and we traveled the lake pretty extensively. The water was also down this year as they had not had much rain and the winter was not as 'snowy.'There is no shortage of good looking Pike Water at Apisko. there are bays, islands and rocks. However, I just beat myself to death and could not find the big Pike. I fished shallow, as deep as I could find, and everywhere in between. We trolled, I cast until my shoulders were aching and could not raise the bigger fish. Weeds were just barely coming up to where you could see them under the water and couldn't find pike there either. It was HOT HOT HOT while we were there in the second and third week of June and every day was 85 degrees or better. It got to 90 one day. I think this had drastically hurt the Pike bite but maybe it was just me? On a good note, we killed the Walleye. Mainly 18-22"" fish but healthy and as aggressive as anywhere else I have been My wife and I caught 75 in a 2 hour span one afternoon, so there are plenty. We ate Walleye until we almost puked and there were just 4 of us. In reality the Walleye could be caught at will and were shallow up in 3-4 ft of water for the most part. Biggest Walleye came in at 24."" Not Master Angler but hey when it is 85 and the sun beating down every day with no real pike to speak of I was glad to just be catching fish!Overall, Sas Lodge and the Apisko Lake Outpost I feel are darned good for what you get versus what you spend. We were there for 7 days. Our total trip cost was around $1,800. The operation, as mentioned is professional and tries hard to meet your needs. Planes are first rate and I believe if we had had better weather - cooler, we would have found a lot more fish there. This lake is known for big Pike so I am sure they are there, I just was not finding the right spots I guess no matter how hard I tried.. I would certainly recommend the lodge and the outpost at Apisko, just with cooler weather! Two drawbacks at this outpost, and they are really minor in my opinion, is that the water pumped in is not potable. You either have to boil it or use a purifying system. We just boiled it and stored it in a 5 gallon plastic container we took with us just for that purpose. The second thing is that SAS does not do a mid-week camp check to see if you need supplies or in our case MORE ICE! We almost ran out and believe me that is something you do not want when it is 85to 90 outside! Other than that my group was pretty happy with the trip and the lodge. Hope this helps.Mike"

6217138,AMPHIB206,2018-07-04 07:45:00,191,"Yes it is. Someone from Minnesota caught and released it a few years ago. You have to use big, big bait for big pike. Suckers, Tulabee- hang on for the ride !!"
6217216,mikejent1963,2018-07-04 09:23:00,7,"Hi Mike,Yes, it is the lake that holds the Manitoba record as Amphib indicated. I have no doubt the big pike are there and in abundance, we just struggled with the Very, intense hot weather and I think it drove them into the deepest water they could find-which by the way does not seem very deep for the most part. I have a depth finder and I used it pretty expensively but could not find any really deep water or drop offs. The average water temp was running about 72-74 degrees if that gives you any indication!I know Mike Borger had Apisko on his list to visit, so maybe he can really embarrass me by going there and catching 25 or 30 Master Anglers as he seems to always do! Sas, at least in my humble opinion truly has their act together and they run a pretty tight ship. I would like to go back but with stable, cooler weather. The cost versus what they provide in the way of accommodations I believe is very reasonable.Mike"
