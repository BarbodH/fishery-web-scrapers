6215554,Caleb,2018-06-30 19:46:00,36,Thanks for the information. We were suppose to go last week but had to cancel. We are now going the first of August. Haven't been there that late before hope fishing is good at that time.
6218288,Bigiver,2018-07-07 09:53:00,94,"Caleb we are heading up on the 14th. I will try and post something when I get back. It would give me great pleasure to give you a report like Woods but add the big ones just started. We also have been going up for 30+ years and and always hope this year is the best one yet. Woods if your still following, what part of the river were you fishing? Have the walleyes made it up to Big Sand yet? Thanks for any feedback."
