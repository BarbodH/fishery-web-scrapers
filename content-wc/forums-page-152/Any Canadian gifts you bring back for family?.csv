6216628,Golden Eagle,2018-07-03 07:33:00,2642,A few years ago I placed 10 cans of Malkins on the checkout counter and my fishing partner asked what I was going to do with all that jam. I replied that I would take it home and trade it for *****. Within seconds I was approached by the most attractive young lady in upper MN who asked where I found my jam and said she loves Malkins jam. My fishing partner smiled and bought 4 cans for himself. He never told me if it worked for him.

6217200,pjshorthorn,2018-07-04 09:01:00,5654,"Many years ago when I took my first trip to Canada, my Grandfather was under strict instructions not to come home without x lbs of Tenderflake Lard so my Grandmother could make her pie crusts. When my wife and I got married, my grandmother passed down her receipes including the pie crusts. I'm now on the hook for the same thing. Gotta bring Tenderflake lard home so Momma can make her homemade pies for everyone that visits. I think she is pretty low on lard so I guess I'll have to figure out how to take a trip to Canada soon ðŸ˜€ PjShorthorn"
6217224,Baseline,2018-07-04 09:34:00,3207,I used to buy Cuban Cigars and would hand them out at the annual wild animal feed my friends and I put on after hunting season. When then they stopped selling real Cubans and only sold the ones rolled in Canada I stopped buying them.

6217356,Ogoki,2018-07-04 15:39:00,291,"Pjshorthorn, I read your post about the Tenderflake lard. Depending how busy I am , I sometimes go to Bear Camp and work for fun 2-3 weeks. Guide people , run baits , help successful hunters skin their bears . A friend of the 2 owners comes up most years . He is a chef. Said to me save some bear fat . He got a single burner stove and a pot of water . Told me to chunk up the bear fat and drop in water , when it began to boil . He took off to pick blueberries. He took the rendered lard and made pie crust with it and used the blueberries for filling . It was some of the best pie crust I ever had . His filling stayed together , when the pie was cut too ( nothing to do with the crust ). Awesome . When we skinned my wifeâ€™s bear this spring , the one owner had me save the fat , as he has several lady friends who demand bear lard from him , for their pies . Spring bears donâ€™t have the amount of fat that the fall bears do . Itâ€™s also crazy too , but in big blueberry years , the bear fat has purple in it from the amount of blueberries, they consume ."
6217440,pjshorthorn,2018-07-04 21:53:00,5654,Thanks for sharing that cooking info. I never heard of bear fat being used for pie crusts. I'll see what the wife thinks about the idea of me going on a bear hunt for her blueberry lard PjShorthorn
6215950,andreindy,2018-07-01 18:09:00,308,"Is there something that the family looks forward to you bringing back from Canada (aside from walleye)? Maybe not the healthiest parenting move, but my kids were fascinated with the different kinds of candy bars and snacks I brought back for them north of the border that are unavailable in the States. Any place between Thunder Bay and Nakina that are regular stops for you?"
6215964,kettyspanky,2018-07-01 18:24:00,271,I usually get some jams to eat at the border and some shirts or hats at Whitefish lake or at the border.
6215986,btyreprich,2018-07-01 19:00:00,1067,"When I was first married and didn't have any kids, our group would do fly in trips to Manitoba. There was a souvenir shop in the Winnipeg Airport that always had small hand carved ducks that my wife enjoyed. Later on it was several cans on Malkin Jam that can only be found in Canada. Stopped that as this jams were nothing but sugar."
