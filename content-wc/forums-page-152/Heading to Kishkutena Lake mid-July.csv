Wondering if anyone has been there recently and would have advice on baits, colors, and general patterns for bass and muskie. Boys wanted an adventure for their fishing getaway before college. Portaging in looks like it will certainly fit that request. &#x1f642;"

Anyway, there were 5 portages, at the time some easy, some a little more work. - several ladders to pull over, a beaver dam, and at least one ""creek"" (short stream) to wade up - the last portage. We camped on the right side after entering, perhaps 1/4 -1/2 mile over, on the right side. There is a nice rock with a small bay, nice area. We didn't look for an island to camp on, I guess there are some, a better choice to protect the food supply from creatures. I honestly don't remember seeing any perfect camping islands. At the time, Mepps spinners, with dressed single hook bucktails caught a ton of smallmouth. We also got some muskies - I caught 3 - in the several days we were there. I imagine plastics would be a good choice for the bass. Good luck, it will be a fun trip, I still have found memories while there with my late father, and my other friends. Please give us a report when you complete the journey. Bill"

There looked to be some decent spots, but we weren’t looking for campsites so I don’t know of any specific spots to suggest. We stay in a cabin on an island near the eastern end of the lake. Smallmouth: we’ve tried every type of lure/presentation that we could think of for them, but nothing even comes close to the success we’ve had with live bait under a bobber. Crawlers or leeches. Both work about the same. Probably 3-4’ below the bobber. Jig head, hook and split shot, didn’t seem to matter. Pretty much any rock pile will hold bass. The best spots we have found are spots with both weeds and rocks in close proximity. We focus on muskies, but will take an occasional break during the afternoon to catch some smallies. I truly believe 100+ is a reasonable total if you fish for them most of the day. We’ve caught fish up to 21”. Several 18-19”. Also several 10-12”. Muskies: we focus on muskies and we like to cast, so we haven’t trolled much. Our success rate when we do troll is really high. Our experience is that casting will produce MANY follows each day It’s a blast if you have the muskie fishing outlook. If you’re looking to constantly boat fish, you may get frustrated at seeing so many fish and not hooking them. Hopefully you’re better in the figure 8 than me &#x1f642; Boating 1-3 muskies a day per boat is a pretty good expectation if you’re focusing on muskies. Some days more, some less. As far as lures, we use all the usual suspects. We’ve found that they tend to like downsized bucktails and rubber over the regular sized stuff. Weeds, rocks, points all provide good action. There are an unbelievable amount of fish in this lake. We’ve caught mostly low-mid 30’s. I caught one 41” and a buddy caught a 42”. I’ve seen some mid 40’s fish and there are tales of fish over 50”. It’s a great lake for smallies. Size and numbers. It’s a great lake for numbers of muskies. It’s a beautiful lake. I’m jealous of you and your sons. Hope you have a great trip!"
6215974,IlliniMuskie,2018-07-01 18:44:00,22,"Also, it may be worth your time to fish Marl (the last lake before Kish) for muskies. It’s loaded with small muskies (27-34”). We talked to a couple guys who boated 23 muskies there in one afternoon. We’ve had great days there, but nothing quite that good."
6217072,twobearlake,2018-07-04 00:14:00,379,"Thank you guys very much! I have gleaned the information from this site's archives as well. I appreciate the additional information and encouragement from both of you! I will definitely post a report when we return. By the way, I shared you posts with my two sons. Their response, WC is awesome! It's good to see that at least in some areas I have raised them up to appreciate the outdoors and the people who embrace helping others enjoy what nature has to offer. :-) Thanks again!
