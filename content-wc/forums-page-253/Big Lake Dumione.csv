4103265,fsz,2015-08-04 19:12:00,144,"Try the search function on this site, you will get some hits on Dumoine. I think most of the users of this site fish Ontario there are a few who visit quebec, many of them fish Hebert and Gouin. I fish in the area of Dumoine, But I have never fished Dumoine itself. From what I understand it is a dark water lake (as opposed to the clear water of Kipawa). Walley, pike, but no lake trout. It is also an exclusive rights lake- must go thru the outfitter to fish it. There is another site called kipawa fishing forum .net that has some folks posting about Dumoine, including a recent trip report."
4105561,Powder3578,2015-08-05 16:02:00,5,Thanks fsz. I have done some searching on this site and Kipawa.net. Club trout lake was also an exclusive lake. I was looking for some info from this year. What I have found says it has average size fish with good numbers.
4207338,bartidge,2015-09-16 17:34:00,12,"Our group has fished Dumoine a few times. Walleye fishing is good. Good numbers and good size by our experience. Northerns - decent numbers but we've never gotten anything big there (i.e 40+"") It's a big lake and the northern portion of it is in the Verendrye Park, so you will need park licenses to fish up there (outfitter Eric can provide them). Eric / Dumoine Lake Cottages has exclusive rights on 2/3 of the lake. Ten Mile Lodge has exclusive rights on about 1/4 of the lake... and the rest of it in the northern fingers are in the park. It's been about 7 years since we've been. We've done two fly-in trips there and two drive in trips. The last drive in trip there 7 years ago was ****. The last 1/3 of the road had really gotten to be a rocky goatpath and 4x4 required/slow going. I heard recently from the outfitter that the last section of road has been recently graded and substantially improved in the last year or so tho. You drive to a staging point on the lake (outfitter's camp) and load all your gear on to his 28' pontoon boat and he sherpa's you to your cabin on the lake - he has 6-7 cabins remotely located around the lake. Your boats and gas will be there for you (10HP 16' abbitibi boats) Given the size of the lake, it can a challenge to boat on any given day. We've had afternoons where the wind and waves were well beyond small craft advisory in the main lake and even in the fingers was a bit dicey. But you have to take the good days with the bad. There is also a Lake Trout outpost lake in Eric's territory (Lac Maltaise). He has boats in there and will take you in on ATVs if you want to go.

4208994,doubleheader,2015-09-17 12:43:00,2652,"Stayed at Ten Mile Lodge once. We were there towards the end on May at a boat only cabin on the east end about 10 miles from the lodge. There were plenty of walleye but for the most part they were situated in the eastern most creek fed bay, and after a day of two I felt like I was in a box. We found a couple other area where the fish had moved but those areas were inconsistent. I suspect later into June would be better but that group I went with goes to Ten Mile every year in May and between 6 guys catch about 400 walleye in a week. Believe it or not the #1 bait in that lake over the years has been a 4"" Berkley Gulp minnow on a jig. The black flies in May were absolutely horrible the year I was there. The road getting to 10 Mile Lodge really sucks bad and it's about 3 hours off a hard road to the lodge. I would not take anything but an older 4wd that you won't mind if it gets dinged up a little."
