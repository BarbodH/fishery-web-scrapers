4223762,55walleyes,2015-09-24 17:46:00,131,"1. Slate Falls will be opening an outpost on Hooker Lake. I am booked in early July 2. Hidden Bay Lodge will now have an opening at Blackstone in early July. I am very excited to be returning to Hooker Lake. It is best lake I have ever fished and from what I read on here Slate Falls is a great outfitter. I do want to take this opportunity to thank Hidden Bay. They have been great to me and I highly recommend them. Great service, economical and great food."
4223850,Mike Borger,2015-09-24 18:12:00,1554,When I fished with Slate Falls in August I heard some pretty amazing stories about Hooker lake. Will be interesting to see how it fishes next year.
4223962,Daveygravy,2015-09-24 19:18:00,88,"Fished Hooker last week of July every other year for the last 10 years. Great numbers lake , but haven't caught any over 26 inches."
4224026,wallydave,2015-09-24 20:00:00,2151,"A big thumbs up for Hidden Bay! Great crew and equipment! They know how to put you on the fish, and know how to provide outstanding customer service!"
4224290,55walleyes,2015-09-25 00:49:00,131,I would give Blackstone an edge over Hooker on size. For me Hooker has produced better numbers by a substantial amount. I do have one 28 incher from Hooker and know of one other one that size as well.
4224362,Mike Borger,2015-09-25 05:43:00,1554,"So for the guys who have been to Hooker, the concensus is it's a numbers walleye lake?Any idea how long the camp sat vacant before Slate Falls acquired it?"
4224666,adempsey,2015-09-25 09:00:00,963,Based on what I've read it looks like it closed in 2009/2010 due to some issue with the government? The last reference I could find was a report from July 2009. I believe the management of the lodge also transitioned in 2010.
4224746,Lovetofish,2015-09-25 09:32:00,458,I know some guys who moose hunted there two maybe three falls ago. Seven men and they shot seven moose.
4224986,Daveygravy,2015-09-25 12:12:00,88,We have fished Hooker since 2007 and haven't seen anyone at that camp ever. We go the last week of July and the 6 of us have caught thousands of Walleyes on Hooker & Vincent and haven't topped 26inches. Maybe earlier in the year would produce a bigger fish.Anyway it's a real fun lake system with lots of walleyes.
4226210,Ebarnett,2015-09-26 12:02:00,60,Is there another outpost on Hooker or Vincent other than Slate Falls?
