The lakes temperature was the highest we can remember. Still in the seventies on the surface. The old pros on the lake claimed it had been the best year ever for the continued walleye bite, but I think they took our week off. We fished hard, with small jigs as the wind did not give us much drift, and we caught short walleyes early on. Later in the week when we expected the bite to pick up, it didn't. We constantly marked good schools of walleye. If we were smallmouth fishermen, we would have been okay. Some beautiful bass were caught but not targeted. What do we do, blame global warming? We had a great trip regardless. Old friends and new always make a great trip no matter how challenging the fishing. We're pumped for next year already. There's always a good fish even on a tough trip."

Slip-bobber, lindy-rig, and oh so many more. Switch from minnows to leeches or crawlers.Like many have said before ""it's fishing, not catching"" sometimes we need to put on the thinking cap and figure out the puzzle. Contrary to popular belief, you can catch walleye doing something other than jigs.Really nice eye, that is one to be very proud of."
