Now mind you, we had 4 dogs in camp so we could not venture out on the boat for a 10 hour day. Nonetheless, we did do some adventuring and overall it was a great fishing experience. Overall, the river was a more consistent bite than the lake, but both were very good. 29.5 walleye was our biggest, but had a good number in the mid to upper 20's. Numbers were also good and if you were on a good school, 20-30 fish per hour was common. Minnow/1/4 oz jig combo was the best bait, but we also caught fish on ring worms, swim baits, gulp and crank baits. The resort we stayed at was Golden Eagle. This is Clint and Marie's first year at camp and maybe their attitude was so good because they are new, but by far the most refreshing hosts I have been to, and I have never had a real bad experience. They both went above and beyond to make our stay great. Clint brought us to grouse spots and marked up a map for fishing. He also offered to take us out on the boat, but we did not take him up on that offer. I did mention we had dogs in the camp including a 9 week old pup. Marie would let the dog out to go pee so we could fish longer without coming back. That was HUGE to us. Some of the charges  gas: same price as pump at $1.23 per liter. Can't ask for better. Minnows. $4.50 per dozen. And I will just say, Marie is a terrible counter. I laughed when I mentioned my 6 year old does a much better job. Conversation  always great. A place I would highly recommend going back to. And it doesn't hurt excellent fishing was just down from their place. Marie is also a vet and can tell you, she has seen some things from war I wish never would happen. Great people all around. Sure hope they make it."
