4228402,Baseline,2015-09-28 05:11:00,3207,We are always respectful of a resort's property and my group leaves the property as we found it. We follow the usual list of check-out procedures placed in each cabin. I always follow up with a note or email to the owner with comments about our use of the property including any needed maintenance. Everyone also pays on terms as agreed. I'd say resort owners are very happy with our group. We always pack out any food that we bring in. About the only thing I ever use are paper products left by the previous group. If the refrigerator doesn't have enough room because of other food in it. I pack up what was left and deliver it to the owner.

4226954,v-bay gord,2015-09-27 08:20:00,3168,Most camps would empty the fridge and scrub it out. The food would be given away or used....and never left for the next guests who arrived......perhaps in a fly-in situation.
4226970,uv2021,2015-09-27 08:28:00,48,"That is why I personally never leave anything behind.Plus it cost me money.So I take it.I was just thinking in terms where people do leave stuff behind.There is one camp I have been going to for 25 years,summer and winter.Summer is a fly in and winter is 60 km ,s by snow machine.The camp pretty well has the same people going in and out year after year.So that is a special situation where we bump into the same people.But when you have multiple cabins or the camp is going to be empty,leftover food is no good.""The food would be given away or used""Another reason to leave a note."
4226994,zeebee,2015-09-27 08:36:00,1144,"If we are gonna leave a messy cabin cause the poker game went too late then there will also be $100 cash on the table. Fly ins will be cleaned regardless...poker ends early.As for leaving notes on food.....yeah right. If you have time to write a note, you have time to discard or pack it up. Not gonna use an opened package left by someone I dont know unlessits the Pope and he doesn't do the fishy thing."
4227050,123chadder,2015-09-27 09:00:00,429,"we clean the cabin,sweep beds and floor and deck,do dishes,chop and stack wood for next guests,clean out boats,fill boats and geny with gas.....leave it cleaner than you found it...i must say im guilty of leaving canned food,left a bag of garbage once,,i felt sooo bad....and left a tray of ""special"" brownies by accident for mike borgers group.....i must add i am a legal cannabis user"

4228354,roscoe33,2015-09-28 01:25:00,653,"We always clean up, better than at home. Everything but the bathroom. We offer leftover fresh food to the camp owner or his helper. Things like eggs, butter, fresh fruit or potatoes. Most of the time they take it. Maybe it saves them a trip to the store ? Maybe they use it for bear bait ? Anything opened gets packed for the trip home. What we usually leave in the cabin, are things like extra ziplock bags, foil, plastic wrap, dish soap, paper toweling, new sos pads, and paper cups and plates. None of us smoke, only one of us drinks, and when dad gets board he has been known to wash the windows. So the place is pretty clean when we leave. A few years ago, the first time at a resort, on Tuesday afternoon the owner came and told us that we had to put our garbage and aluminum cans out in the barrels so they could pick them up. They didn't want us piling it up in the cabin, and attracting pests. When I handed him a kitchen garbage bag that was about 3/4 full, he couldn't believe it. Mom taught us how to plan and pack 40 years ago. No glass, very few cans, no styrofoam, no boxes. And pack it in/pack it out wilderness camping taught us what we needed, and how to avoid creating trash that had to be carried out."
4225962,v-bay gord,2015-09-26 06:59:00,3168,"Lot's of discussion on what guests think of camps and their owners. Ever wonder what camp owners might say about you after you leave? Here's a few thoughts on the positive and negative side. On the positive.........guests who are happy and interesting to be around. Guests who treat the staff well and appreciate them by leaving a tip or compliment. Guests who respect the equipment and cabins by leaving them in good shape. On the negative......damaging equipment and not telling anyone. Leaving a cabin with every dish greasy....usually prefaced by the comment ""All you need to do is make the beds, we cleaned up! Guests who are demanding and generally give off a negative attitude during their stay (fortunately not common but a real bummer for everyone when they are around). As a camp owner we see all combinations of good and bad, but generally most leave with a favorable impression because most have good qualities (even if they might be messy). If you can't handle difficult situations like a ""duck shedding water off it's back"" then you're probably in the wrong business. Just know that owners do appreciate the really good guests that leave a cabin clean or tip their employees. Thank you to those of you who are ""good guests"".."
4225978,Mark R,2015-09-26 07:17:00,1538,I always figured the camp cleans the cabin after a guest leaves. Don't get me wrong we always do the dishes and wipe down the counters etc. we also leave some food in refrigerator for cleaning ladies if they want it. We dont clean showers or stool don't make beds or mop the floor.
4226002,Mike Borger,2015-09-26 07:53:00,1554,"Regarding food left in the fridge I can only speak for the fly in operators, but everyone I've talked to says they can't stand it LOL!People usually always bring way too much food and it adds up over the course of a season. Usually it ends up being more garbage to pack up and fly out, it's not a bonus at all.I'm just as guilty as everyone else (maybe more ) and will be doing my best in the future to plan and pack a little better so there's no leftovers."
4226010,v-bay gord,2015-09-26 08:01:00,3168,"When I say ""leaving a cabin clean"" I don't mean it's ready for the next group......just tidied up, and not looking like your teenage daughters bedroom........"
4226074,1jigfish2,2015-09-26 09:04:00,110,"V-Bay Gord, what about leaving food in the fridge? I am not talking about half eaten meals. I mean ketchup, new oil, potatoes, butter, etc.."
4226114,ftfarms,2015-09-26 09:58:00,444,We were told by the camp owner to leave what we wasn't taking home in the fridge this year. I'm guessing if thay didn't want it thay would burn it instead instead of putting in there dump and attracting the bears.
4226146,v-bay gord,2015-09-26 11:01:00,3168,That's a good thing. Stuff will get used rather than thrown in the trash. When people ask we always say just leave it in the fridge........not a problem. Fly ins may have a different opinion.
4226178,Ebarnett,2015-09-26 11:48:00,60,"When we enter a camp, it is a big turn off to see a bunch of food in the fridge. Who knows how long its been there, who's been fingering it...etc. We always throw it out and replace it with our fresh food."
4226194,prov1800,2015-09-26 11:57:00,5010,Well gord on the nagative parties which are far and few inbetween and you happen to be guiding them you have to put up with them all day.at least yout lucky when they leave camp.lol.thank goodness this rarely happens.
4226306,Fisherman Ted,2015-09-26 15:18:00,461,"Lodge owners are only human. Yes, we all strive to treat everyone the same and provide great service and a smile to each person that walks through our door. But there are those guests that stand out. The most important thing that strikes me more than anything else is a smile. I kid you not.A friendly demeanor is so welcome to an owner that pours their soul into their lodge and sometimes is running on fumes. So many of my guests do smile and are happy and it is especially important when the fishing isn't always what we hope it will be. Most fishermen get this (its fishing) and to be honest it kills me when guests get cranky if the conditions are tough. Its one thing to say you had a tough day its another to complain about it throughout happy hour and dinner. The fishing is pretty much the only thing we can't control so the last thing we want to hear is how it was a tough day, for like 4 hours.If you however have a positive attitude that puts me in a much better frame of mind. I take MANY guests out after dinner in my personal boat on my personal time to see if we can't get them their first 30"" walleye or put a fly-rod in their hand for the first time. You can bet that offer (complimentary of course) will not be extended to a customer that treats me with disrespect. A smile goes a long way!Sure people are messy, so that's no big deal. But if you disrespect me, my staff or my equipment you go to the bottom of the list. I have seen guests break a rod (no biggie) and then hide it in the bottom of the boat compartments so we don't find it. Seriously? Is that how your were raised. You can destroy a motor, accidents happen. But be a man and own up to it. Compliments will also get you far, especially if they are genuine. We care for our lodges sometimes more than our personal homes. When you point out the new bathroom counters, or paint, or deck or whatever it shows you care and are attentive. We are human and its nice to know our hard work doesn't go unnoticed."
