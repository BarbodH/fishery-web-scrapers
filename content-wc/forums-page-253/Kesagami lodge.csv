3838481,phishfearme,2015-05-04 18:45:00,1242,"do a search here - lots of feedback from myself and others - add ""partridge"" to your search as many stay at that cabin and portage over to kesagami for much much less money. for example, see: https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...ight=partridge phish"
3838553,Mike Borger,2015-05-04 18:58:00,1554,"I guided there many years ago. Walleye fishing is fantastic although in my experience more of a numbers fishery. Most anglers fish Kesagami for pike which can be world class. It's a very shallow lake which can get quite weedy so you're not going to be targeting typical shield type structure. It's basically a big shallow bowl smack dab in the middle of the James Bay lowlands. Jigs will catch all the walleyes you want. The water is highly tannin stained so brighter citrus colors (lime green, orange, chartreuse) shine. Fish around any of the main lake islands, around any obvious points and in the narrows south of the lodge and you'll catch all the walleye the want. Use the wind to your advantage - always fish the windward shoreline. Be careful, the lake can really blow up!"
3838777,PIKEMAN330,2015-05-04 20:16:00,101,"I fished the lake three times about nine or ten years ago.We fished the southwestern part of the lake and had great times.It is a very interesting lake and we caught plenty of fish.In three trips we only saw one boat from the Lodge. They told us that the lodge owners told everyone not to go to this area and there was no fish there.The Lodge has new owners now and that has to be a good thing.I think you will like the lake.I dont know about the Lodge.Good Fishing,Pikeman."
4195417,spoonchucker,2015-09-11 10:18:00,82,PJC_ Did you go and what was it like. Would welcome a report
4197818,pjc,2015-09-12 20:17:00,6,"Did get to Kesagami in July. Great fishing, camp and service. Ran into terrible weather, but guides put us onto fish. Was wet windy and cold. Will be going back here again. Very different lake to fish though. Big lake, shallow and very little structure, but still lots of walleye."
4219081,spoonchucker,2015-09-22 09:53:00,82,Did you get on to or see any big pike caught? Kesagami was certainly at one time known for big pike and my group will be primarily interested in the pike fishing.
4219281,Mike Borger,2015-09-22 11:02:00,1554,"Go early in the season when the pike are in the bays, you should catch plenty of large fish."
4220041,spoonchucker,2015-09-22 17:53:00,82,Mike- What is early in the season there? With a shallow lake like that I am guessing the lake warms early. Also- if we can't get there until end of June or 1st week July are the Big pike attainable?
4224386,phishfearme,2015-09-25 06:20:00,1242,"when we were, the lodge would close s week or two after Canada Day - not enough business. not sure if it's still that way but it sure makes for a very short 1.5 month season. hard to stay in business. phish"
