4223706,mickr,2015-09-24 16:46:00,74,"If you are looking in eastern Ontario, I'd look at Kashwakamak Lake or Big Gull before Crotch lake. I've been to all 3 and IMO Crotch is the lesser of those three. All within a few miles of one another. The Ottawa River is an awesome fish. StoneCliffe is a little outside your travel range. You said 1.5 hour north of Ottawa, I'd say Pine Valley or Morning Mist are about 2.5 hours. I have fished there several times and the fishing is excellent for walleye and pike. I did a quick check on the Pine Valley website. If that interests you I would check with them on whether they have large boats to rent than a 14 with an 8 hp. I know the area well, it is a bit of a run from there to the best spots and if the wind gets up on the Ottawa you do not want to be on it in a 14 foot tinny with an 8. Morning Mist which is right beside Pine Valley has bigger boats to rent. But, you did say 1.5 hours north so check out this link to Quebec outfitters. Tons of places to go. I've been to quite a few but when we go to Quebec we go much further north so I can't speak to anything within that distance from Ottawa. http://www.pourvoiries.com/en/ Another place you might try within your 1.5 hours from Ottawa, on the Ottawa River is Laurentian View Resort. I fished there many times back in the 90s. Fishing was good then and by all accounts fishing has improved on the Ottawa all over since they bought in a spring slot about 10 years ago. http://www.spotswoodslanding.com/ I googled it, I guess they changed the name. Same owner as when I was going there back in the 90s. Lorne Spotswood. Good guy."
4229386,Ferrispata,2015-09-28 13:06:00,63,"Thanks Mickr,Big Gull is actually the lake we are ready to move on from, having spent 4 years there with marginal results.. We have thought of Kashwakamak as an option but weren't sure if it would be an upgrade on Big Gull. Any good options to stay at on Kashwakamak that have boats/motors, cottages, etc?Thanks for the info. Really appreciated!Ferris"
4229578,mickr,2015-09-28 15:13:00,74,"Kash is a better lake that Big Gull for walleyes IMO. There are a few lodges on the lake, the one that definitely rents fishing boats is www.fernleighlodge.com. If you do go to Kash, PM me, I have maps and can give you a few spots. There are some big walleye in that lake, I have managed several 25 inchers, but you'll have to work for your fish Another lake in that general vicinity you might try is Wolfe lake. Or Buckshot lake. Those recommendations aside, those lakes do get hit pretty hard by cottagers and by people looking for table fare. The Ottawa River recommendations if you want to travel just a bit further get you in to some pretty decent fishing with good numbers and opportunity for size. Mick"
4218433,Ferrispata,2015-09-22 06:29:00,63,Any decent options out there? We are coming from US and are looking for some decent walleye fishing within 1.5 hours from Ottawa. What options do we have? Thanks.
4218721,adempsey,2015-09-22 08:15:00,963,I'd ask here: www.fish-hawk.netA lot of guys from that area on those forums.
4218817,Consigliere,2015-09-22 08:38:00,132,If coming from the US just hit the St Lawrence. The walleye bite is coming on there with the chance for some big ones.
4220017,Ferrispata,2015-09-22 17:31:00,63,We are aware of it being good but we all grew up there and would like to find somewhere up in Canada a little farther away.
4220826,MrSimon,2015-09-23 07:58:00,922,"Try the Ottawa River from Stonecliffe up to Mattawa. It's an absolutely beautiful place to fish with unlimited amounts of rocky structure, islands and bays. There is definitely a good population of walleye in there, but it's so stinking big you'll have to hunt them down. A good walleye fisherman with good electronics could do really well there. Earlier this month we stayed at Pine Valley Campground. We rented a nice three bedroom cottage for something like $90 US a night. Can't beat that. They had nice docks and a killer view. We found the fishing pressure in that area to be very light. Good smallmouth fishing too. One day we pulled the boat and drove up the road a bit to Deux Rivieres and launched there. I think the walleye fishing was quite a bit better up there. There was a nice looking lodge there called Kingfishers something or other. And no your graph isn't broken, it really does reach depths of 600 ft in places."
4220906,Ferrispata,2015-09-23 08:47:00,63,"We had another mention of Ottawa River as well but that far up the river is outside our traveling limit unfortunately. Looking for something not over 3 hours from 1000 Islands border. Stonecliff appears to be about 3h 45min. Is there good walleye fishing anywhere a little more east on the Ottawa River. What kind of walleye numbers did you get, how many fisherman and how long did you stay?"
4221474,MrSimon,2015-09-23 13:12:00,922,"We fished for 4 days. There were 5 guys in a pontoon boat. The weather was HOT, no wind, and super clear skies. Absolutely horrible walleye fishing conditions. It's hard to target walleye from a pontoon boat, especially in conditions like that. So our results were poor, boating maybe a few dozen walleye only with the largest being 22"". We caught OK numbers of smallmouth and found some medium sized pike in weedy areas. I could see the eyes on the graph sitting at the bottom of breaks in about 30-40', but we had no anchor or trolling motor so pinpoint jigging was out. Not to mention they all had lock-jaw. Anyway, it's certainly a gorgeous place to fish and I'd like to go back with my fishing boat under better conditions. PS - If you live close to the St. Lawrence, I agree that it's a much better walleye fishery with giants being caught regularly. And it's so large you could just move 30 miles up or down river for a change of scenery. I've been fishing in Northern Ontario for 25 years and my top five walleye have all come from the Larry."
4221546,Ferrispata,2015-09-23 13:30:00,63,"We ran into the same issue last week at the lake we were fishing. Really sunny and warm. Worst outing in 4 years. We are definitely contemplating a St. Lawrence stop next year in Sep but will shoot for the Canadian side for a change of scenery or at least downstream 45 minutes if on the American side, as one of our friends has been getting some large 'eyes lately. We have a short list of other options that people have mentioned as well including a couple lakes (White near Ottawa, Crotch), and the Ottawa River (just not as far out as you were).Thanks for the help.Ferris"
4222786,Consigliere,2015-09-24 07:33:00,132,Kingston area half hour east of the bridge is getting on fire right now. Fish are coming in onto the shoals.
