4222322,eyemike,2015-09-23 20:01:00,233,"I took my wife to Booi's 2 years ago and it is an excellent fly-in. The cabins are beautiful, 2 story with 2 decks on each cabin and 2 bathrooms. they even had dishwashers in the cabin. We did the houskeeping, but from what guests were saying their menu is second to none. They have a free steak night that isn't too shabby. Their boats are 18 footers with 30 and 35 hp. Honda elect. start motors. As for the fishing, there is no smallmouth in Trout Lake. The walleye fishing is great. We were averaging 60 walleye days with very few under 20 inches. There is big pike, I caught and released a 45 incher. The lake trout fishing is as good as it gets. My wife and I did not chase the lakers but many in camp did and were very successful. They have a great website that is very informative. I am willing to bet that your wife will be a convert to Canadian fishing trips after going to Booi's"
4222346,Daveygravy,2015-09-23 20:11:00,88,Thanks for the suggestions! I will be researching them. Keep them coming.
4222418,tyeegs,2015-09-23 20:49:00,177,Howey Bay camps out of Red Lake offers remote fly-ins. Dave and Margaret are very nice and run a terrific operation.
4222946,Hawker,2015-09-24 08:30:00,3967,Young's Wilderness Camp without a doubt has EVERYTHING and more than what your looking for! My wife and I have been going here for the past 24 years and have no interest in attempting to find a camp that offers more!! My wife LOVES YWC (as do I) and can't recommend it high enough!!http://youngswildernesscamp.com/
4224090,Daveygravy,2015-09-24 20:16:00,88,"Have you fished highstone? If not , what lakes w/hidden bay have you fished ?"
4224274,46Harley,2015-09-24 23:23:00,149,"x2 for Young's Wilderness Camp. We have our reservations booked for our 6th consecutive year. Clean as a pin, well kept, nice boats, great food, great staff. Try it, you will like it.....we did."
4225850,Daveygravy,2015-09-26 05:05:00,88,"I like their half trip on low and the other half at their fly in option. Have you been to Kish? If so, how was it?"
4225898,wallydave,2015-09-26 05:44:00,2151,"Miniss is the only lake I have fished with HBL. We flew over Highstone on our way to Miniss. Shaggy the pilot, said it's a good fishery. Miniss is better, bigger cabin and body of water. Highstone looks to be easy to fish, and looks like windy days would not be a problem.Miniss was fantastic! Tim marked a map for hot spots to fish, every one held fish, some of the best fighting walleyes I have ever caught! Nice cabin, with plenty of room, indoor plumbing, solar lights and Skype phone too.HBL is flexible with late season trips, they might put you and your wife in a bigger cabin/lake. They did for my 3 person group."
4227322,Hawker,2015-09-27 12:05:00,3967,"Kish is phenomenal for LOTS of big Smallmouth and loads of Musky! There are no Walleye or Northern Pike there, but there are some dandy Lake Trout. The cabin there is very nice (will sleep up to eight) with a large kitchen, big gathering room, and the view from the deck is beautiful!"
4220266,Daveygravy,2015-09-22 19:22:00,88,"I need suggestions on a camp that is woman friendly. This will be my wife's first fishing trip to Canada and I would like her to experience the peacefulness of a single camp lake while still having an american plan. I prefer fly in's , but a boat in or drive to would work if remote enough. We like to fish walleye , smallmouth and pike."
4220362,ftfarms,2015-09-22 20:32:00,444,I would say give Jared at obabikon bay a call. He has what your looking for. It's a boat in on lake of the woods and walleye and smallmouth fishing is awesome and obabikon bay is some of the best northern fishing in that area. Have a great trip and god bless. It's not a single camp lake but it's not a lot of boats around.
4220434,wallydave,2015-09-22 20:53:00,2151,"Check out www.hidden bay.com Highstone is a smaller cabin, they have a great meal plan, they put you up the night before the flight. Top notch plane, and staff. Nice drive to Sioux lookout. Eagle Falls Lodge on Red Lake might be worth a look, American plan, boat in, two lakes to fish, Red and Parker. Happy shopping!"
4220618,acplumber,2015-09-23 03:10:00,80,Leuenbergers on kag lake is supposed to be very nice I've heard nothing but good things about that place. Or u could try the old post on Pickle lake. I know a guy that goes there every year and raves about it
4220690,Baseline,2015-09-23 05:20:00,3207,There are so many resorts offering what you want it's hard to make a recommendation. In recent years resorts offering the American Plan have generally remodeled and provide a great accommodations and a fishing experience. My recommendation would be to take a late winter trip to the NW Sports Show in Minneapolis. That way you can see what you are buying into and talk to the owners.
4221002,Bill Krejca,2015-09-23 09:27:00,6107,Good choice. Bill
4221090,3 Z's,2015-09-23 09:59:00,133,"Check out Witch Bay Camp, drive in but located on a remote bay. My wife loves the place."
4221122,Ogoki,2015-09-23 10:12:00,291,Mattice Lake Outfitters has some very nice cabins on single cabin lakes. One in particular comes to mind that my wife and I stayed at is Bellsmith Lake. Very nice cabin with a detached shower building. Smaller lake so it is very fishable in bad weather. Look at MLO website. Don has pictures of each camp. We are already booked for next June. We have a couples trip planned.
4221346,orchard frank,2015-09-23 12:11:00,1900,"Wife and I fished together forever. Lost Island is on Lac Seul, other lodges on this huge lake, but it is on an island by itself. Top-notch American Plan, great staff and owners. Once we went there, never went anywhere else on a Canada trip. Lots of couples go there, nice cabins, about 8(?) cabins on the island, meals in the main lodge."
4222002,stevensinks,2015-09-23 17:14:00,330,My wife loves going to Bow Narrows on Red Lake. That's the only time she fishes.
