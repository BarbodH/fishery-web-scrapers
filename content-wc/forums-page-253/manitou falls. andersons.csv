4219385,UpNorthGuy,2015-09-22 11:49:00,53,"Stayed at Knotty Pine's Lodge in June and fished Unexpected and Goose most to time so we went past the Outpost a few times. Looked like it was in pretty poor shape, although better than the year before. Looked like either un-booked that week or they weren't ready to use it yet. 2013/2014 it was mostly covered in garbage and unmowed most of the two years. That part looks to have gotten better."
