Knotty Pines Lodge ie formerly English River Outfitters, Naughty Pine Fish Camp, and Walt's English River Fish Camp. I've been to every iteration of this camp.Can anyone give me a recent fishing and water level report? I've seen a few posts mention low water compared to years past. Low water make getting into Johnson, Clear and Unexpected lake's a bit tricky and makes the run through Barnston Rapids way more fun!Thanks for any help that I get..."
3960441,UpNorthGuy,2015-06-12 15:20:00,53,"Just got back from a fantastic week fishing on the English River down stream from Manitou falls. Fishing was off the chart, pretty much everything/everywhere we tried worked. Walleyes are our main thing we fished for. We stumbled upon a really hot Muskie spot in Goose Lake. Lots of numbers (walleye), size was average no big trophy's where taken by our group, largest walleye was 24"". Stayed at the newly open Knotty Pine Lodge on Wegg Lake run by Norm Roy. For being his first paying customer it couldn't have been better. Clean rooms, good bait, and a great time. He's got some work to do but he's headed in the right direction. Looks like Anderson Manitou Falls fish camp finally has its head on straight and has ""cleaned"" up is act."

3979570,UpNorthGuy,2015-06-18 16:36:00,53,It was a new thing for us as well. We found them at the mouth of Moose creek on the south side of Goose. There are some rocks on the east lip of the creek and we speculated they were chasing bait fish up against the rocks.
4218121,UpNorthGuy,2015-09-21 21:24:00,53,"Thinking about heading up to Knotty Pines Lodge in October, but my problem is I can't get up there until about the 20th. Couple questions: How long do I have until freeze up?? and where should I look for late season walleyes? Was really happy with our trip in June and cant wait to get back."

He was the owner of the old Naughty Pines Fish Camp. I would be asking Norm when he planned on closing up & allow a little wiggle room based on the weather. I am of the opinion that you can catch walleye just about anywhere on the river up there. Later, Jay"
4219361,UpNorthGuy,2015-09-22 11:39:00,53,"Jay221 - Thanks for the advice. I texted Norm and it looks like he'll be there until the end of October or early November. Checked out his facebook site and from the looks of it he's been working hard on the camp, and from the pictures the fishing is still spectacular. https://www.facebook.com/KnottyPinesLodge?fref=ts Water must have really come up, pictures shows his dock underwater."
