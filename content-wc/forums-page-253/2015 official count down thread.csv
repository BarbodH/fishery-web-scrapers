3148985,rnnonmt,2014-09-03 18:39:00,992,"It may be a little premature but for those of us that only get to experience the great Canadian fishing waters it can not come soon enough. 277 days to go!I cant wait for another serene wilderness adventure coupled with great fishing, good friends, great memories and lots of laughs. My Dad started taking me in 1982 when I was 10. Here we are 31 years later and 20 plus trips to Lac Seul and the last 5 of them with my oldest son. I used to live in Chicago which was an easier trip to make but now that I live in Phoenix AZ it has become a bit more challenging but I still manage to make it. Most recent years we have been taking a motor home and towing my boat and I hope to continue this for more years to come. In another couple years my younger son should be capable of staying out on out boat for the entire day but... we will see. Whats your story and your count down?Happy fishing Folks!!"
