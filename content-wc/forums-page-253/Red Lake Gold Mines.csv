We did manage to grab a sign from the place that said ""Little Long Lac Gold Mine"" and I do still currently have that. It was a pretty interesting place, complete with an old Theatre and Drs. office with old medicine bottles."
1961153,fourt2,2013-07-18 12:30:00,45,"Aaron--exactly the kind of ""adventure"" I'm looking for...though I doubt I'd abscond with a sign (too much work carrying it back, I think).To all of the other helpful replies: my sincere thanks! You've given me a ton of sources to investigate...-42"
4229274,Guest,2015-09-28 12:09:00,0,back in the 70's i hunted the old gold mine trails on the west of Red lake. we used to work off the topo maps and an old map from Black Bear Camp. Straight across from the falls on west shore of Trout you'l see a grassy area. There used to be a cabin there. You'll find a trail heading into the woods I's wide enough for a truck . Keep in Mind I haven't been on these trails for over 40 years. This trail will take you back about a mile to the old mine head. across a little creek. there used to be a large open area with old building's. They area around Bow Narrows camp used to be the mine community. The fire sign across frpm the camp used to the old pool hall. When you enter the narrows from the east there was an old sutter's store the called the Chinaman's. Everyone traveled byb boat to get somewhere. In the west of Bow narrows is the Spir Mine but that's private know. If you go out im Pipestone bay and head NW to the rock wall there is a old mine there. The ore carts and track where still there. Scott Bay On South side you'll see the landing This trail will take you over to The Golden Arm. If you take the first trail on the left this will take you back to an old mine. Back to the main trail this will take you to the Mt. Jamie Mine. and Rowen Mine. These are still working mines. We gold price is up they open the mines. When I used to explore there was this Crazy Frenchman and his Indian sidekick who lived out there in the bush. He had more junk sitting around. The mining company would buy it and he would run it till he broke it. He would always invite us in for tea and free BS. When I hunted this trail in the 70's it was abandoned. Nothong more than and ox cart. Noe there is a nice gravel road from town that goes back through this are. I f your interested I have pictures of some of the old mines
1957609,fourt2,2013-07-17 11:29:00,45,"Last year my son and I did a little bit of exploring on the west end of Red Lake--on shore. We had seen some maps that showed abandoned gold mines relatively close to the water, but they weren't ""real"" maps--more like drawings, if you know what I mean. Tied the boat to a tree, left a note in it in case somebody was worried, and trecked north-ish from the Trout Falls area. Finding our way back was simple--we just followed the blood trail we left from going through the pricker bushes...As near as I can tell, we didn't come anywhere close to actually finding the mine we thought was near our landing area of choice. May actually have been closer to finding Jimmy Hoffa...Not actually looking to find gold, and not looking to trespass or anything like that--just think it would be kind of neat to see the actual mining site...only problem is that I haven't been able to find any resources that might help locate such a site. Willing to hike a couple of miles if necessary (and this time, we probably won't try it in sandals like last year--we didn't really plan the excursion so much as got a sudden idea to try looking around).Anybody have any suggestions on where I might find GPS coordinates at best, or at least a good map/description at worst that would help us explore?Of course, pack-in = pack-out. Not looking to defile the countryside, or anything else--just a little hiking adventure to see yet more things that we'll never see around home.Any help appreciated!-42"
1957689,new hips,2013-07-17 12:01:00,498,"I've seen the map, there are quite a few active gold mines in the area. We saw a barge bringing in some large equipment a few years ago. With the price of gold dropping it's probably not as lucrative today."
1957745,NARDA 1,2013-07-17 12:13:00,636,Have you tried Google Earth? You might be able to get some info from their satellite imagery.
1957777,LOW1,2013-07-17 12:20:00,2828,Have you tried the topographical maps? And there is a Red Lake museum/tourist information center which would likely have older topographical maps and books dealing with the mines in the area.http://www.redlakemuseum.com/Here's the current online Ontario top maps linkhttp://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business...02_167954.htmlPaper copies are available from online map stores such as http://www.fedmaps.com/I have bought buy antique geological and other maps and books regarding the Lake of the Woods area from this source.http://www.vialibri.net/ It's hit and miss re what they have.Here's a very good Winnipeg dealer in antique books and maps which may be able to help. http://www.lysecki.com/main.html
1957841,Pawchaser,2013-07-17 12:39:00,31,"Check Red Lake Regional Heritage website under History/Immigration then search Red Lake immigrants for Carlson, Artur and read his background. He worked on the west end of Red Lake in the mines in Pipestone Bay. In '99 my husband and I visited a mine site on I believe the SW side of Pipestone. At that time there was still part of a cabin, rail, small cart, chains and a few other things there. It was just right up from the water. 2 minute walk. Last fall when we were in Pipestone we didn't go down that far but could see what looked like a home built there now. Viking Island Lodge on Douglas lake is owned my Carlson's son and Enid Carlson has a blog I read all the time. I love reading the history of the Red Lake area."

1958353,Aaron-IN,2013-07-17 15:29:00,500,"When I was a kid my dad took me on a fly-in to Uchi Lake Lodge (that lodge burned down). One day we stopped (pulled the boat up) on what looked like an old trail so we decided to follow it. About an hour into the hike we happened upon an abandon town of sorts.....I mean what looked like a sprawling town at one point. If memory serves me it was called ""Little Long Lac"" and it was an old gold mining town. We continued another hour or so walking until we ended up at Confederation lake, I'm guessing the same Confederation lake I've seen mentioned here at Walleye Central. Anyway, it was a pretty neat hike."
1960369,troutwater,2013-07-18 08:43:00,299,Did you happen to take any pictures of that? Sounds like it would be pretty awesome to see.
