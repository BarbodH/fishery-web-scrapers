First time on lake, really enjoyed it. Largest crappie was 13-1/2"", all were fat, we ate crappie every day. Water in the eastern portion of the lake was still very green with algae, water temp was 66 when we got there, 65 degrees on Thursday. Weather was unusually warm, mosquitoes were still around. Walleye fishing was only fair, perhaps we could have done a little better on them had we used minnows and targeted them but it still was OK. The crappies bit best from noon on. I'd like to go again, nice area. Bill"

The first trip we caught lots of walleyes and this year we did well on crappies and fair on the walleyes. Did your crappies come out of deeper water? Ours were mostly caught in over 20' vertical jigging 2"" twister tails. That was the second week of August. Did you stay at Cedar Point Resort? I'm taking the rest of the week off to go to southern Iowa and hit the farm ponds for what we like to call ""turbo"" gills and crappies. Hope to hear back from you."
