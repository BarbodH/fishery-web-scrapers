4175225,SinOrSwim,2015-09-02 06:45:00,1528,"Is it possible to take your boat out of the water and go fill it up? What if you had a talk with the owner as a GROUP and respectfully asked why it is so much higher? Explain how happy you all are as a group with the facilities and everything. Maybe he has an explanation. If not, then maybe to make a point, everyone take their boats out, go fill up and bring them back. Or, are there other facilities on the water that sell gas to the general public? I'm guessing it would be worse if he has gas that isn't selling. I use our marina to fill my houseboat because I like all the other services. But, theirs isn't double the price of land based stations. If so, I might have to think otherwise for a couple 100 gallon tanks."
4175337,pjshorthorn,2015-09-02 07:13:00,5654,"Just another data point in the event you decide to have a discussion with the lodge owner. I never even looked at the gas costs when I paid our bill. I acknowledged we were charged something, but in the overall scheme of trip costs, fuel in camp is always a very small portion of the bill. Out of curiousity, I pulled our bill and the gas cost was less than 2% of our overall bill. This is what I affectionately call ""noise""...........meaning I typically won't spend time worrying about it.......at all. We burned next to nothing with the boat we brought as we didn't have to make long runs to find fishing spots.Our fuel for the camp boat was covered as part of the package. Having said that, we were charged sub $4.00 US per gallon for fuel that we purchased for a personal boat. We were charged VERY fair, which included a very favorable exchange rate since the lodge charges in CDN funds. Our trip does not compare apples to apples with yours in terms of length of stay and overall fuel consumption so the $ we spent will probably pale in comparison to your trip. It probably also doesn't equate in terms of the lodge's laid in costs for fuel delivery. Take those variables into consideration for what it is worth. I understand your concern completely ........tough discussion to have if you are happy with everything else. I guess it comes down to whether the group feels the gas cost is the tipping point in order to find a new lodge that offers the same type of camping and fishing experience. Best of luck on your decision moving forward. PjShorthorn."

4177761,hogridnfool,2015-09-02 23:46:00,349,I paid $1.28 Canadian per liter at the camp on Mameigwess Lake.
4178417,btyreprich,2015-09-03 09:42:00,1067,"We always fill up our boat in International Falls and used to bring in a few gas jugs with us - until owner asked us to stop. I'm all about saving money and agree that the prices you mention are quite high. With that being said, I suggest you look at the total cost of the trip and compare it to other lodges with a similar set up on the same lake. Might be there is not that much of a cost difference when comparing the final bill. Every lodge owner has the right to make a profit and this lodge might be designating gas sales as a higher profit area versus say minnows."
4178609,Moondog,2015-09-03 10:37:00,362,"All postings have been appreciated. Here is the final math on the subject: We came to camp with a full tank of gas. Over the next 7 weeks we purchased 99.2 gallons of gas at camp at $9.60 per gallon including 13%HST. This was 22% of our total camping bill. If we had purchased gas in Red Lake during that same time period (we had a car and we know) fuel was $3.84/gal US dollars. Had we pulled our boat we would have saved $500 plus dollars. And the camp owner pays a distributor in Red Lake in Canadian funds further compounded this price gouging. We pay our bill in US dollars. Yes, I think it is gouging. No I don't think talking to this owner will make a difference. No I don't want to change camps (Yes we are in the process of getting prices at other camps). But the truth be known, I think it is fitting that the owner know exactly how I feel about it. No, I sure don't blame anyone for trying to make a living but once again.......we, the long term campers, are the ones being penalized. Folks in camp renting boats don't pay for gas, folks in camp for one week rarely need gas.........it is those of us that love the camaraderie we have established and spend extended periods there with others of like mind that are getting screwed. We are also all low maintenance and often help others around camp and do chores. We don't come to Canada for 7 weeks to save money and spend all kinds of money in town during our stay as well........food, bait, tackle, dining out, liquor.......boat repair etc. So thank you all for your input. We will be sitting down with the owner to have a nice civilized chat about this come next spring."
4178721,bigwalleye1,2015-09-03 11:45:00,2632,"$9.60 seems like a lot of money, esp if loading and running to town when you seem to be going anyway is an option. Sounds like it may be some tricky footing in a discussion, but you never know. Perhaps he only seels gas because he needs to..."
4178761,Moondog,2015-09-03 11:54:00,362,"Obabikon and VBayGord, I respect both of you as honest forthright camp owners. How would you approach this particular camp owner who can be difficult?"
4209146,Moondog,2015-09-17 13:49:00,362,"I agree, I wouldn't mind paying double! In fact, I'd be glad to pay double but not triple. It was $8.50 per gallon PLUS 13%HST = $9.60 American (and we paid in US dollars) and camp owner paid local distributor in Canadian dollars. So if you factor in the exchange rate at that time fuel in town would have been around $3 per 4 liters in American dollars. It has never been about the money. For the amount of fun and camaraderie that we have at fish camp......as the commercial says.........priceless. It has always been about being taken advantage of. And certainly I have never begrudged anyone of making money, taking profits and being an independent business owner. Very very difficult, very hard work not to mention making a years income in 5 months.Stayed tuned next spring for the continuing saga of ""Gas Cans VS Pay and PAY and PAY at the PUMP."""
4209202,Bobby Winds,2015-09-17 14:25:00,10817,There is no way I would wait until next year to address this with the owner. BEFORE booking another night there I would address this and make it very clear to him that you are being taking advantage of and need to resolve this BEFORE booking 2016 as that is where your leverage is.
4209866,ftfarms,2015-09-17 19:56:00,444,I totally agree. Three times is a little to much.
4209914,prov1800,2015-09-17 20:23:00,5010,Not sure where you are staying but around the area where i do business the camp owners respect there guests not disrespect them.man charging those kind of prices is like getting kicked in the balls.if you need some info for a stay next year where you will be treated like gold you know how to get a hold of me.

4186377,Moondog,2015-09-07 14:44:00,362,"Thanks, Jared............pretty much figured that. Planning to bring one (empty) next year. OK, mebbe I will fill it up!!!!! Remains to be seen."

4196393,clawman,2015-09-11 18:48:00,2078,"Ever seen a RICH resort owner, I haven't? Do you think the guy is getting rich because he is charging a couple bucks more for gas? Their season to make the entire years revenue is short. If you want the facilities to be kept up and available you have to pay for somethings."
4196481,Obabikon,2015-09-11 19:21:00,2370,"clawman, I of course agree with what you said. This isn't a ""get rich"" type of job. However, I will say that some resort owners use different tactics to make the same end goal. Some ""nickle and dime"" and some try to hold hostage. Neither are very good tactics to keep customers happy. Just be up front and post your prices. Base your prices on what you need to earn. If you need to make $50 to be successful. Charge for your most valuable commodity. The problem with charging double the cost for fuel, is that people feel like they're being taken advantage of. If the owner simply increased his base rate... he could make the same amount of money, without upsetting his client base. (which would be a MUCH better business decision) (just my 2 cents)"
4196857,Moondog,2015-09-11 23:27:00,362,"Amen, Jared.............. As previously mentioned I would be more than happy to pay more for my site or Less for the long term camping we do but Price gouging gas is a sore point. With everyone. No just me. Everyone that gets there bill and see that all things equal we are being charged $9.60 American for gas that is purchased in Canadian. Being a small business owner myself.........I am the last one trying to deprive a camp owner of his or her due. You can make a living by treating customers fairly without pissing them off."
4197794,Guest,2015-09-12 19:52:00,0,Moondawg - tell me more about funning naked at happy hour. I don't remember that
4197874,Moondog,2015-09-12 20:49:00,362,"Harry, Sorry we missed you! Naw, you didn't miss a thing. I believe it was another poster who was talking about someone getting kicked outta camp for streaking. I can't recall anyone running around naked since you did that a few years back!"
4204362,Baseline,2015-09-15 12:15:00,3207,Earlier this spring I was at a boat in resort on Lake of the Woods and paid the $7.10 CA for a per 4 liters. If you are staying at a resort for 7 weeks you cannot be the typical customer. I'd say the owner would be very happy you are a customer. I'd think the owner would be very happy to hear what you have to say. There may be a perfectly good reason to justify the cost of their fuel. If they can't or won't lower the price then the balls in your court.
4208706,ftfarms,2015-09-17 10:49:00,444,We were charged a little over $5 US at a boat in on the BIG LOW in August. I think that was more than fair. Well maybe to cheap. I don't mind paying 2x's what it is in town. They have to plan so they don't have a bunch left or problems with a pump or tank problems. Every thing today cost a lot to fix. Most camps we stay at charge 7-8 bucks a gallon Canadian.
4178897,skindzier,2015-09-03 12:45:00,137,What about possibly buying gas from other outfitters on the lake? I know on LOW in Nestor Helliar's sells to anybody/everybody - maybe there's a camp there that would sell it to you. Might send a bit of a message too. [Edit: Obabikon covered my suggestion already - he posted while I was typing... ]
4178937,Moondog,2015-09-03 12:55:00,362,"Well said and again I appreciate your honesty. Would love to come to your camp but our camper doesn't have pontoons!!!!! Hey we are just retired fun loving crazy about fishing people who call what our group does.........SUMMER CAMP FOR OLD PEOPLE!!!! I think the pissy part about all this is the apparent complete disregard for common sensibilities. If I could pay a reasonable amount for gas and extra for the primo camp spot I would be fine with that. COME ON, MAN! BTW......Our ""group"" consists of a number of people camping PLUS occupying 1 to 3 cabins per week. Everyone is miffed about this as we all bring our own boats to camp."
4178953,Moondog,2015-09-03 12:57:00,362,"The last time we asked, the closest camp to us refused to sell us gas in deference to our camp owner. Didn't ask the others but planning to do that this winter. Good suggestion."
4179097,Huntindave,2015-09-03 14:14:00,2194,OH really? Are you saying the boats are free? OR would it be more correct to say that the full cost is already added into the rental cost of the boat?
4179361,v-bay gord,2015-09-03 16:34:00,3168,"x 2 on Obabikon's thoughts, and I would lean towards #5. There have been recent inspections occurring with some operators that have resulted in extra costs for lodge owners....ie moving tankis, upgrading all aspects of fuelling stations. Could this be the case here? Another option would be to have a friend email the lodge/campground owner with a link to this discussion......"
4179449,Moondog,2015-09-03 17:34:00,362,"VBG and Obabikon.......wise words as usual and thank you. Thinking of printing this thread and taking it when having a calm discussion when we arrive next spring. If nothing happens or threats are made that really changes the whole complexion of the issue. Let me be clear......our ""group"" are people in their 60's and 70's, including grandparents that are raising their 3 young grandchildren. We are retired. We are not rowdy, vulgar or run naked thru camp (except for happy hour!) and very low maintenance. In fact, many in the group assist the camp owner with daily activities/chores around camp. That makes it seem just a little bit more unfair. So I am putting this to rest until next spring and thank all of the posters for their valuable suggestions."
4179505,rnnonmt,2015-09-03 18:24:00,992,Paid 11 bucks a gallon in 2014 at Lac Seul in Chamberlain Narrows. Needless to say I only took on enough gas to get back to Deception Launch.

4182753,Guest,2015-09-05 13:51:00,0,"We paid $30 US for 15 liters of gas, which seemed high but we're not allowed to bring in cans of gas. What can you do?"
4183545,tackleman,2015-09-05 23:30:00,444,"been following this thread for a while now and I have heard from people who own these camp, that there is a law that prohibits guests from bringing jerry cans into the camps to fill up their boats. perhaps vbay gord can comment on this. is there a law or just the camp owners own rule."
4178865,Obabikon,2015-09-03 12:27:00,2370,"Camp sites are not high profit businesses. There's a reason that there are fewer and fewer. They are obviously supplementing high gas prices, and trying to make their business more profitable. The problem is that people feel ""fleeced"" or pinned in. Especially if you tell them they aren't allowed to bring in gas. From a business owner's stand point, their intentions are fine... the way they are doing it is not. I would have told them to raise everyone's weekly camp site rental by $10-$15. Probably makes them the same return (or close to it), and at the end of the day, guests don't feel like they're being taken advantage of. Now, your situation is very different. You've brought it to his attention, and it sounds like the concern was brushed off. Is there an option of filling up at another marina on the lake? You could also ask, since you're there for 7 weeks, if it is ok once a week to take your boat to town to fill it up. That'd be the same as if you were renting 7 different 1 week rentals. Again, this shouldn't be an issue, since you're not getting a discount for taking 7 weeks (which is a completely different problem in my opinion, but that's another topic). Here's the way to figure out what to do... in this thread, the average price of fuel appears to be in the range $6-$6.50. That's at least $3.10 more expensive that the average ""on the water"" places. In 7 weeks, you probably purchase (as I'm sure you come up with a full tank) in the range of 100-120 gallons of gas. They are taking an extra $300-$400 in fuel prices during your trip. That'd be around $50 per week. If $50 extra per week added to your trip puts knots in your stomach... you have to resolve it. There's no way to enjoy a vacation when you hold resentment or anxiety about where you're staying. The alternative is that you can just budget $50 extra a week, and don't even look at the gas bill. Just understand its part of your trip. Basically here are your options.... 1. Approach owner about bringing gas again, and explain your serious concerns 2. Approach owner about going to town once a week for gas 3. Approach owner about discount for extra weeks, and that could supplement the extra gas costs 4. Find alternative gas on the lake, and use that service 5. Do nothing, and just enjoy the trip. Understanding that there's an extra $50 per week fuel charge Every situation/owner is different. Personally, I would want to know. However, my place is based on full service. Everyone has to be happy all the time. I work my butt off so that the guests don't have to. That's a very different situation than a camp site. If the owner is a good one, he'll want to know. If he's a bad one... he'll be a jerk. A lot of people can handle having service from a jerk. All they want is a place and a lake... service doesn't matter. So, if you have a jerk owner, and you don't want to rock the boat... find an alternative way to get gas. Good luck! Sorry this is so long."
4174145,LOW1,2015-09-01 18:04:00,2828,This summer it seemed to run about 20 cents a liter more than the in town stations charged. It was cheaper than I have paid in the past and with the currency exchange rate I am not complaining in the slightest.
4174329,bigdaddyguns,2015-09-01 19:10:00,608,I paid $5.70 CAD / gallon this year.
4174417,Moondog,2015-09-01 19:32:00,362,"I agree with all the positive postings and feel that a discussion with the camper owner is necessary and appropriate. And I agree with VBAYG and Obabikon about weighing the good vs. bad. However this has become a very sore topic and questions have been raised in the past and we get blown off by the owner. We pay a premium price for a lovely campsite and $180 per week warfage. If you then go to the camp website the following is posted: DO NOT BRING GAS TO CAMP We provide the following at no cost: Power at every slip Boat launching ramp (at camp or river) Fish freezing You can obtain your licenses, live bait, ice, and treated water at camp. So.........we pay for the power at every slip aka warfage. We only launch our boat once and fish freezing? I believe that the DO NOT BRING GAS TO CAMP should probably not be mandated. And this camp is not on an island. The only benefit that we appear to NOT pay for is the ability of the camp inhabitants to use golf carts when available, not being used by other campers or broken. I would gladly pay for this service rather than feel fleeced over the fuel. I guess its just the principle of the whole deal. As a private business owner I understand about making a buck....big time. I understand that camp owners only have so much time to make a living. I understand all of this. I certainly do not begrudge anyone from making what they can. That said......$9.60???? and then to say that we can't bring gas to camp?? BTW......we can no longer be assured of buying our licenses at camp (bad internet) and live bait is no longer available so we do have to go to town for that. Its sad that we have to be worried about getting kicked out of camp if we bring gas. And we do not get a discount for staying long term. What say you?"
4174449,Obabikon,2015-09-01 19:37:00,2370,"Wow, that's pretty bogus. To say not to bring gas... and then charge double? In my opinion, not an ethical business practice."
4174505,Ron engesether,2015-09-01 19:47:00,46,"I need to understand this a little more, You are parking your camper on site for 180 a week? Besides gas, are you paying for anything else there that gives the resort addition funds?"
4174649,Richard B,2015-09-01 20:47:00,735,This summer we paid $8.00 U.S. for fuel. I did not feel that was bad at all considering we where almost 30 road miles and 22 miles by water from the nearest gas station.
4174713,Moondog,2015-09-01 21:30:00,362,"Ron, $210 for the campsite. IN ADDITION, we pay $180 for wharfage. The facilities are wonderful, no doubt about it. And we have many friends that join us!!! Super super time. So is it worth it? That is the question. Do we get our bang for our buck? Sure!!!! But then we feel so taken advantage of when the price of fuel is obviously outrageous."
4174745,Ron engesether,2015-09-01 21:50:00,46,"My advice is to just let it go, and chalk it up and here is why. Yes they are gouging you on gas and I know that is not right, but in essence you don't spend a lot of dollars there totally, (other than gas) if I undrstsnd correct. Roughly 400 a week, so 2800 hindered a year, and I am know you are one of few staying for many weeks at time and not recieving any discount, but the end profit dollars are not probably going to really drive the owner to feel compassionate, and especially when you have attempted this before and you did not get an open ear. If you we going to a lodge and staying 7 weeks and spending a couple thousand or more a week I would feel the other way 100 percent. I just think that the way you talk you are happy with place and it sounds very fair, and it is just the gas issue and I don't see how you will change it. If you did attempt anything I would try to ask him to sit down over a cup of coffe and explain your side and hope for the best than to just start bringing in gas, because I think he will feel cheated and come up with a new fee to get even. This is just my opinion and it is probably worth less than you payed for it. Good luck."
4174793,Moondog,2015-09-01 22:21:00,362,"Well said. You got it nailed. Sucks, tho."
4174929,Skyraptor,2015-09-02 04:29:00,291,"IMHO I would have a talk with the camp owner and let it be known that you are not happy with the current price that he charges for gas and also let him know what other gas stations in the area charge and wait for his explanation. I would not be happy with the owner not allowing you to bring in extra gas but it might be a liability reason or his insurance does not cover it. In the end you are free to choose to go to any camp that you want if you are not happy and if you leave, others that you camp with might do so also and that will affect the owners pocket book. There are other camps that would welcome a camper like you, long term stay and low maintenance."
4173281,Moondog,2015-09-01 13:04:00,362,"Are there any camp owners out there willing to share what they charge for gas? I reason I am asking is that this year our camp owner charged us $9.60 per gallon including HST. We are pretty pissed about this and are considering bringing gas cans and going into Red Lake to get fuel and fill our tanks. We are long term guests (7 weeks) and feel our camp owner is punishing those of us who stay more than a week. People there one week rarely buy gas. We are pretty much at our tipping point and not sure how to handle this whole situation. We love the camp, love the people we camp with every year but this was two times the price of gas in town. What do other camp owners suggest short of not going back. I sure don't feel good about this and we have been faithful clients for 15 years. Moondog"
4173321,Huntindave,2015-09-01 13:09:00,2194,Paid $6.70 per gallon on the water at the dock last week of July this year.
4173353,Lovetofish,2015-09-01 13:23:00,458,I think I paid $6.40.
4173449,Bill Krejca,2015-09-01 14:07:00,6107,"Some differences in price can be a reflection on how/how far the gas is delivered to the camp. For example, it is usually expected to be more if the camp is located on an island, or at the end of 50 miles of wilderness. Deliveries to a camp that is right off the highway and fairly close to the tanker fill are usually less expensive than the former. I have a strong feeling that at most camps,very little is made from gas sales. Also, there can be some tank loss from evaporation, according to a relative who once had a large tank near his dock. Bill"
4173457,tackleman,2015-09-01 14:08:00,444,"i'm not sure what I pay, just get a bill near the end of the season and pay it,. but it's kind of funny that this is your topic today because I was just talking to a couple from iowa today on the lake and they were telling me they were getting ticked at the price they pay too. maybe I should do a survey to see what is being charged around here and have some sort of reference for the future."
4173489,v-bay gord,2015-09-01 14:17:00,3168,"What others charge really doesn't go to the heart of the matter in your case. I would be upfront with the owner and mention how you love coming there over the years but you're wondering why the gas cost is so high. If you get a satisfactory answer then the issue is resolved. If you don't, then mention that the gas cost is a tipping point for some in the group. Most camp owners would want to know what aspects of their service (in their control) might be hurting their business."
4173657,Fishin Fun,2015-09-01 15:15:00,218,I think I paid $6.40 also. Paid $7 last year.
4173857,prov1800,2015-09-01 16:12:00,5010,Id be headed to another camp.lots of them around.whoa what a rip off.
4173937,Obabikon,2015-09-01 16:27:00,2370,"I'm an 8 mile boat ride for the barge to bring me fuel. This summer (cost has gone down some) I've been paying in the range of $5.65 / gallon (delivered). I've been charging in the range of $6.65 / gallon. I encourage guests to bring as much gas as they want. I'm happy to store it for them, and they can use it as needed. I also tell them that the marina is a less expensive pump. With delivery and everything... I have to charge more. Some purchase from me, and some don't. I always say... ""I am not in the gas business"". Just want to break even on it. Some camps are designed to make money on every little service... that way they can charge less for being there. The best option is always to discuss the issue with the owner. If you're staying on the ""cheap""... a few extra $$$ for gas probably isn't going to kill you. If you're paying top dollar... then you might have an argument. Just try to remember, that they are doing their best to make a profit. If you feel they are ""fleecing"" you in one area, but are under charging in another... maybe you just let it go. Since you're there so long, there's always the option of just taking an afternoon and going into town to fill up."
4173953,Obabikon,2015-09-01 16:33:00,2370,"As an example: the Morson Grocery store that just opened charges in the range of $10 per gallon of milk. I buy a couple gallons every time I go by. Is it cheaper in Baudette? Yes. However, we need a store here. So... we need to support it. Sometimes overpaying for one product/service isn't a big deal... when you're getting another product/service that you desperately need or a product/service at a huge discount."
