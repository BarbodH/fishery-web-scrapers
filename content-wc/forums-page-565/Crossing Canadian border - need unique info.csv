1122699,hawks_rule,2009-07-21 13:17:00,115,"I had similar problems with misplacing/losing my passport, I was not asked for either on my trip returning home last Saturday. I'm not sure if I just got lucky or perhaps fell under the 3 month grace period mentioned earlier in the thread. I promptly ordered a replacement after my return. Actually both border crossing were the fastest and easiest in > 15 years of travel. Good Luck"
1122819,phishfearme,2009-07-21 19:16:00,1242,hey herb - lots of good advice here - you should be able to get back into the US just fine - maybe not next year though. hope you have the best trip of your life!! phish - fellow x-CECo employee (see your pmail)
1123088,Northern Manitoban,2009-07-22 17:39:00,195,"which border, is it one on the Ontario side? i'm going to be crossing through Manitoba to North Dakota, Roseau area. I only have birth certificate and picture Id (drivers Licence) hope there is no problem."

1121651,Hammerhead Herb,2009-07-17 06:19:00,259,"Need some advice guys. I am planning to cross the border this Sunday for our annual fishing trip. All the planning went smooth until I went to look for my passport on Thursday. I can't find the darn thing; looked all over; dumped the safety deposit box upside down (where it should have been); checked my cigar boxes; done everything. I haven't used it since last year's trip to Ear Falls. It's probably due to the fact that I turned 65 a few months ago and am suffering from CRS (Can't Remember Sh-tuff). So now what do I do. Can you get into Canada with just a birth certificate and a driver's license AND explain the hard luck story to Canadian customs AND plead for mercy? Does Canadian customs have a computer file of US passports that they can access to verify that the individual has a passport? I've seen some mention of an Â‘enhanced' driver's license. Does anyone know what they are? Are they the ones that can be read by a card reader? My IL license can be read by a card reader but I'm not sure what it says. Your ideas and suggestions would be appreciated. We are due to leave tomorrow morning (7/18) for the first leg of our trip from N. Central Illinois to Cook, MN. As you can see, besides being forgetful, I'm desperate."
1121657,Guest,2009-07-17 06:39:00,0,"Crossed twice this year at Pigeon River. All they wanted was a drivers license. If I were in your situation, I would stop on the American side with my birthcertificate and explain my situation before going in. You are an American, we have to take you back."
1121673,Guest,2009-07-17 07:12:00,0,"You need to worry about US customs not Canadian customs. The Canadians don't require a US passport to get into the country, the US customs do. My guess would be that you wouldn't have a problem coming or going with your birth certificate and drivers liscense though."
1121675,WalleyeWally28,2009-07-17 07:19:00,298,"Herb,Read 5 of Diamonds post on thread above ""Official docs to cross the US border. Might give you an idea of what you are in for."
1121683,Larry Mac,2009-07-17 07:40:00,530,"Hi Hammerhead Herb, Listening to other experiences like yours earlier this year I believe you will be fine. Like previuosly said Canada does not require a passport the US does. You are a verifiable US Citizen. You might have some delay and explaining to do but you should be fine. Have a great trip.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1121705,Obabikon,2009-07-17 08:44:00,2370,"I personally would bring extra forms of ID... not just drivers license and birth certificate. If you have credit cards, US hunting tags, anything at all that might reinforce your claim to be who you are. I was told last year that when the rule finally went into affect, they'd actually give a 3month grace period. I'm not sure if that's true, but if it is... you're within that time."
1121861,Catman59,2009-07-17 17:01:00,345,We were asked for our passports going in on July 9 and coming out of Canada yesterday. Went in at Pigeon River and came back through Fort Francis. I think it really depends on the officer in charge at the time.
1121910,Northern Manitoban,2009-07-17 22:22:00,195,"I will be trying to cross without a passport my enhanced Drivers licence wont be here in time so I will try and cross into the US with my other ID and birth certificate, i was also told it will be up to the border guard. I hope i get over"
1122580,Kevin R,2009-07-21 06:51:00,305,I understand it is needed for entry into the US but if Canada finds you without a passport why would they allow you in ?
1122639,Kruger,2009-07-21 09:38:00,259,We handed the Canadian Customs official our drivers licenses and he asked how we planned on getting back into our country. He then asked to see our Passports and put each one into a reader.
