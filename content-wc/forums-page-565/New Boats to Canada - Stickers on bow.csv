I am heading to Gull Rock in two weeks and am not sure if I will have stickers in time for the trip. I do have a temp card which is valid in the US, just not sure about in Canada."
1123226,JayM5209,2009-07-23 09:15:00,1050,"Last year I took my new Rebel without the permanent registration or numbers. I had purchased it new and took delivery about three weeks earlier, and the registration had not yet arrived. I took the original copy of the bill of sale and the temporary registration (if I remember, that is a copy of the application for registration). No one asked any questions at the border going either way, and we did not see any OPP or Conservation officers on the water. With the two documents I had with me, I was not a bit concerned."
1123229,Pezman38,2009-07-23 09:19:00,3196,"Jay, That is exactly what I wanted to hear. I have also asked the manager of the camp I go to, I will post his response when I get it."
1123249,JayM5209,2009-07-23 10:33:00,1050,"O.k., now you have to tell us what the new boat is so we can watch for it on the highway northbound. (My son and I leave two weeks from tomorrow for Perrault Falls.)"
1123476,Pezman38,2009-07-24 07:07:00,3196,"Jay, not a problem if you see us going down the road make sure to wave. I sold off my Lund for my first Ranger, so far I am really happy with it. When you see it heading north it will have a kicker on it, but this is the outfit."
