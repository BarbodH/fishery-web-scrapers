1101721,Red Pine J,2009-05-01 10:19:00,44,"I could talk about it all night & day too.....but I'll keep it short to start off with.....maybe....another lol........ Anyways...I've been fishin these waters out of Pickerel Arm Camps since 1993. Words will not do the great times we've had justice......just an awesome experience!!!!!!!!!! We mainly fish walleye & bass nowadays. When my boys were young...they really wanted to go after the ""ax-handles"" ""snakes"" etc.....I wanted to back troll & I suppose that was boring until we got better knowledge of areas..techniches etc etc. We'll be heading for PAC the third week of June. We've settled on this week for a few years now. Met a great guy named ""Smoky"" that has taught us a lot & he's a great man to boot!!!!!!!!! Do you know Smoky.......Colin??????????? Bet you do......lol We've been to Lil' Vermillion with Smoky & he's taken us to the English River & Northeast Bay area. We usually fish the ""Arm"" & spend quite a bit of time @ Red Pine Bay if necessary. I'll stop for now & I look forward to hearing more tales about the mighty ""Minnitaki""....EH!!!!!!!!! Take care & God Bless!!!!!!!!!!! Red Pine J"
1103940,Red Pine J,2009-05-11 05:49:00,44,Anybody???????????
1104144,bad fisherman,2009-05-11 16:54:00,13,"I would like to give you advice on minnitaki, but I have only been there twice and so I guess I am a novice. I don't consider myself as a seasoned walleye fisherman, but I can catch 25 - 100 a day. I frequent this site alot looking for more info on minnitaki because it is a great place to fish and relax for a week. My boys will be looking to catch those ax handles and hopefullly a few walleye during the week. Is there anything for the wife to do other than fish? Need to keep her happy to! All advice is free and appreciated."
1108248,Red Pine J,2009-05-26 15:08:00,44,from Minnitaki???????? I'm sure it's been gr8!!!!!!!!

1123653,RyanG,2009-07-24 18:09:00,16,We are heading up for the 12th time this first week of August. The fishing has always been great. We stay at Abrahms Lake Lodge a mile or so before the bridge.I have fished Pelican and done well but Minn. has always produced more and bigger fish.I see that other folks have posted that the trout fishing is great on Minn. I will be more than happy to share GPS coords. for a few Trout spots.We have a crew of 14 guys and never in 12 years have we caught a trout.We have done very well on crawlers w/ rigs and spinners but this year I am hopeful the slow death will work well.Please email or PM me to talk more.Ryan G[email protected]
1123773,Skiball,2009-07-25 09:41:00,82,"SAW:Thanks for the help. Have been fishing Lac Seul for many years. We fish out of Mahwka in the southern part of Lac seul. Walleye fishing has been good but it seems that we have had to move northeast a bit to get nicer eyes. Any help would be appreciated. Also, is there a place in Sioux Lookout that we can purchase nicer walleye moinnows that are packaged to travel? Good posts as always on this site.Skiball"

1083408,walleyeslayer1,2009-02-24 17:47:00,19,"Anyone fish Minnitaki Lake, or the Sioux Lookout area?"
1083417,prov1900,2009-02-24 18:05:00,544,"Going on our third year in a row. Great for eyes, pike, smallies, and lakers. Fairly easy to navigate, don't need a huge boat. Nice variety of structure. When are you going? Where are you staying?"
1083535,Guest,2009-02-25 07:21:00,0,"Have fished Minnitaki for the last 25 years, keeps getting better, bigger fish! Easy Lake to Navigate, only found one rockpile in all those years. Lake Trout on ultralight is a gas,"
1083562,Larry Mac,2009-02-25 08:34:00,530,"Hello walleyeslayer1, we have fished the Sioux Lookout Area for the last 10 years. Very Good fishing, we have not fished Minnitaki Lake. The Sioux Lookout District has an annual CR program which they publish in there Area Magazine and a lot of Catch and Release Award fish come out of that lake. Have a great trip.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1083650,SeulAreaWalleye,2009-02-25 12:53:00,100,"I live in Sioux Lookout, Ontario and have guided here for over 15yrs. I can provide a ton of info about this area/Lac Seul east, etc. It would be interesting to chat with people that have been to this area, and share experiences...feel free to message me. I may have spoken to some of you before, as I was a member a year ago....just lost my info...lolMinnitaki is an awesome lake through hard or soft water, and so are all the adjoining lakes. Each year keeps on getting better, and more trophies are caught and released. This is now the only area in Ontario with a slot of 18-21"". The rest is one over 18"". There is angling pressure up here, but with a lake system this big, and regs this tight...you can always find your own spot, with lots of action.Walleyeslayer1, I'm sure that you'll have a great trip here, and feel free to ask me for advice."
1083717,prov1900,2009-02-25 16:17:00,544,"SAW, who were you last year? I would also like to chat about Minnitaki."
1083720,SeulAreaWalleye,2009-02-25 16:32:00,100,"The moderator and I tried to find my old account this AM, with no luck, and I can't remember my old info....I'm pretty sure we spoke last year, my name is Colin Gosse, that might help....so....let's chat Minnitaki sometime! I look forward to hearing from you, send me a message."
1083723,prov1900,2009-02-25 16:36:00,544,"You are right, I think we might have and that is why I asked. I will pm you soon because I have some info to share and some info to gain from you BTW, I envy you living up there in HEAVEN. Someday..."
1083785,maverick,2009-02-25 20:03:00,24,"SAW, I come upt to Souix Lookout every summer, we stay in town at a cabin on Pelican, near the railroad bridge public landing. We normally fish the east end of Lac Seul (Sen Bay, Deception Bay, etc..) Last year, we spent a good amount of time on Pelican and had some good luck with numbers, but not much luck with size. I would be interested in chatting with you about good spots, etc....we have quite a few favorite spots, but it never hurts to share info and find some alternative spots... Jim"
1083815,Guest,2009-02-25 21:46:00,0,"This lake has tremendous opportunities. It's too bad that I don't get to take advantage of them every summer like I wish I could. I have to spend most of my year on Lac Seul (no complaints there though!) Got to say that Colin is one of the top 3 guides we have in this area no matter the species, no matter the lake. He'll give you the straight poop. Have a great season! Dragon"
