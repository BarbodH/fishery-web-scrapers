1122625,cruiseforever,2009-07-21 08:52:00,177,What do you feel it a nice amount to tip the help at housekeeping type cabin? I usually only get help to fuel up and get bait.
1122631,Bigfishhunter,2009-07-21 09:09:00,803,"I worked at a lodge as a guide and then a manager for 8 years. Whenever clients asked me how much was appropriate my answer was that a tip should be about 10% of your trip cost. Now all of that could go to the management and they could split it up among the staff, or you can give it in cash to the people that you feel help you out, that way you get to pick who you feel has worked hard for their money. Just don't forget that their are behind the scenes people that work hard and never see a tip. When I was guiding I was the front man so I got the bulk of the cash, we had a girl that busted her but to wash dishes, do laundry, run to town for mail, etc etc. Very necessary tasks and I know she did not see cash handed to her up front. So when I was a manager I realized how much people like this allow us to run a successful, smooth business even thought there is no glamour, so I liked it if the clients gave the tip to me and I would divide it evenly among the staff. Now mind you some liked my straight forward answer and others didn't, I just told them that a tip is exactly that... a tip and it is up to the client as to how much and where it goes. But there is some insight for you, talk to your camp manager, a good manager will be able to look you in the eye and tell you what they feel is appropriate."

If so that would seem steep if say the trip costs $800 and you have 12 guys..I guess it would also matter how many dock people are splitting it too..on our trip there are 2 dock people, a husband and wife..when we leave we give them $20 per man..we also tip the cook $20 per man"
1122931,SkeeterJeff,2009-07-22 09:19:00,31,"We generally tip a total of 10% of the cost for the trip (Lodge charges) and let the owner/manager distribute that out. However, in the five years we have been going on these trips one guy that works the docks has always gave us the best service and lots of fishing tips, so last year I slipped him $100 above what we gave to the owner. He is back again this year, and I expect to give him a bit extra again. This guy puts us on fish every year and is worth his weight in gold. Jeff, heading out in 24 hours!!"
1122966,rockpt,2009-07-22 10:29:00,589,"It's hard to say without knowing the type of service your camp provides. Some camps have dockboys on duty from 6 am to 10 pm for anything you need. Others have dockboys around camp but it's hit or miss whether they're available when you need them and they're off duty after 5 pm. At my camp it's not unusual for me to get my own ice and bait, fill my own tank and just have the dockboys clean my catch at the end of the day if they're around. Same with cabin service. Some camps pick up the trash and provide clean towels and fresh tp every day while others it's only if you ask. At our camp, we're pretty self sufficient in the cabin and rely on housekeeping only to clean the cabin after we leave. I've made over 40 housekeeping trips and what's worked best for me is to tip the dockboys each day depending if they've done anything for me and I tip the housekeeper thru the management at the end of the week. The dockboys seem to appreciate getting tipped at the time they perform a service. And I know that I'm tipping for service that I got instead of just tipping a flat percentage of my total bill. For a typical day, the dockboy might get me a couple dozen minnows and clean 3-4 fish and I'll tip him $10. I usually tip $20 for hauling our gear from boat to cabin or vice versa at start or end of the trip. I usually bring the guys a few decent cigars, too. I'll leave about $50 for housekeeping and that's for me and my wife in the cabin. I think almost as much as tips, the staff appreciates friendly treatment. We've become friends with the dockboys at our camp over the years and enjoy taking time to chat about what they've been doing, interesting happenings around camp or the lake, fishing, etc. I think the natives in particular don't always get that kind of respect and they appreciate it."
1123039,Bigfishhunter,2009-07-22 14:53:00,803,"We had 6 staff at one of our camps and then the other one we had 24 staff. I mean that the 10% should come from each client and that it should get split among all of the staff. Read where I wrote about the laundry girl. On an 800$ trip, that would be 80$ per guy. I don't think that is too steep at all, most clients have rods 2x that price, and like I said, some guys thought I was fair and others did not. I was honest though, and ultimately the tip is up to up to you anyway pay what you feel the service is worth."
1123047,Obabikon,2009-07-22 15:25:00,2370,"I recommend to my guests between 8 and 10% of the total bill. Our tips are split 6 ways, sometimes more. Also, for those of you who take out guides and leave big tips, and then don't tip the rest of the staff as well... I'd consider changing your ways. Guides get paid very well already. I hate it when guests leave $150 for the guide and $100 for the rest of the staff to split up. I understand the guide spends more time with you, and developes a relationship. However, the behind the scenes people work very hard to make your trip enjoyable. All of that said... $20 for a dock boy is fine, unless you ask him to clean fish. If you do that, tip him $20 and $1 or more per fish."
1123237,Guest,2009-07-23 09:45:00,0,"First of all I don't think the camp manager should tell anyone what to tip (especially when they put a number on it like 10%...pfft) and who to tip and I wouldn't leave tip money with the camp owner or manager to distribute (they are not all honest) some camp workers keep in contact with guests and when the guest asks the worker if he or she got the $50.00 they left for them. The reason the guides get the bulk of the tips is cause they are the ones who keep the guests coming back, I think if people catch fish and lots of them they will come back for them and not just for a clean bed. At most of the camps I've worked at, the guests would leave a tip in the cabin and they would personally tip the dock boys and as for the cooks, it would help if they went out to the dining room and ask all guests how their meals were. I guided for a husband/wife/child after 2 other guides put them on rocks for the first 2 days, I got them on the third day and right of the bat the daughter hooked into a 48lb. lake trout and as soon as we had it in the boat the guy pulled out his wallet and gave me a Ben Franklin (guides best friend) and said thanks Harv you just made our whole trip and said we'll do it again after the trip and boy did he ever. We went on to one of the best days of trout fishing in my life and was their best day of fishing all together. At the end of the trip I recieved 8 more Ben Frankilins, he had a vacation of a lifetime and I am still friends with the family today, they actually come fishing with me now for free but that still doesn't stop him from leaving me a tip. Just my 2 cents"
1123271,cruiseforever,2009-07-23 12:07:00,177,Thanks for the info.
1123551,Bigfishhunter,2009-07-24 11:03:00,803,"I was about to say the exact thing Obabikon. Well put. I would also like to add that good managers hire good people, if you have a bad manager well then... you need to find a good one that will hire you for their camp. Running a business must be a team mentality and if anyone thinks they are too good for the team then they need to be cut from the team, everyone needs to contribute and have the support of the rest of the team."
1123679,1shooter,2009-07-24 20:19:00,1493,"Obabikon, So what kind of tips does Otis bring in???"
1123835,Obabikon,2009-07-25 16:34:00,2370,Otis is the PR guy... he accepts his tips in table scraps. Especially on ham night.
1123845,orchard frank,2009-07-25 17:32:00,1900,"Haven't been North for a few years, but my wife and I were steady 2-3 weeks a year for close to 20 years. Tips are seriously appreciated by anyone who recieves them. Dock help, kitchen crew, guides, housekeeping, whatever. My recommendation is to give a decent shot to everybody, give it in person, and give it in cash. Make sure everyone gets your praise and a little $. Whatever feels right, 10% of the total? Maybe, but that would seem like a minimum, especially if you are going to return to the same camp. In the final tally, it is a small amount for people who are trying to show you a great time and memorable trip. Once during a bad blow at Lac Seul, the dock attendent just about busted his a## helping us to dock and tie up, during the struggle, a prize filet knife (25th anniversary present) fell into the water (deep). that kid got goggles and dived for close to a half hour to retrieve it, in very tough conditions. Junior hockey player from Newfoundland. We made sure he remembered the incident as well as we did."
1123483,Obabikon,2009-07-24 07:20:00,2370,"Harvey, I'm not sure what you would expect a camp manager to do when asked what a good tip is. If a guest says, ""what should I tip""... he expects an answer other than ""it's up to you"". Also, you don't have to leave it with the camp manager. But, I can tell you that most camps have a tip jar, that is handled by the owner/camp manager. So, leave it with the girls, the dock boy, the cook... it usually goes back to the owner's responsibility. If you're going to a resort that doesn't have a trustworthy owner, switch places. A slime ball owner can screw someone over much worse than a $50 tip. The guides THINK they're the ones that keep the guests coming back, but are usually wrong. The fishing does that. Without the rest of the staff, the guide would have zero work. Without good owners, clean cabins, good food... guests don't return. Without good promoting, advertising, recruiting... guides would have no new guests. I'm not saying at all that guides aren't important, because they are. Especially the great guides. All I'm saying is this... when opperating a resort, everyone's job is crucial. Maybe the guides should tip the dock boys for docking ""their"" boats, carrying ""their"" guest's luggage, getting ""their"" minnows, pumping ""their"" gas... maybe the guides should tip the cook for packing ""their"" shorebox, mixing ""their"" special breading or baking ""their"" cookies for lunch. Guests pay for an experience... not a person. Very few people come just for a guide, and would refuse to come to a resort if he wasnt' there. Some do... but as a total, not many. (maybe 3 out of 100) Again, I'm not saying that the cook needs to be tipped as much as the guide. However, being tipped 10 times less is silly. If you leave the guide $200, leave the staff something similar to divide amongst themselves. They work hard, and deserve it. Last comments, I (as a camp owner) go out during every meal to ask how it is/was. Breakfast I talk about the day's weather, and dinner I talk about the fishing. Many camps do that. Also, when guests ask what to tip the guide, I tell them a similar number. I also inform them that it's nice to tip additional for a fish of a lifetime or a spectacular day. Sorry for the rant, it just struck a nerve."
