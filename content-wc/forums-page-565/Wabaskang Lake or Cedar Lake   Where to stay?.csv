1122623,cruiseforever,2009-07-21 08:47:00,177,"Planning a trip to Wabaskang, Cedar Lake area next year. I've been looking at the camps in the area and having a hard time figuring out the best one for my needs. Looking for the good and bad of the diffrent resorts. I would be looking at housekeeping cabin. From what I can tell Wabaskang Lake might be a better choice for Northern and Walleye and Cedar for Muskie. Am I correct in my thinking? I plan on going up in July or August. Thanks for any info. Scott"
1122707,lonewolf73,2009-07-21 13:28:00,17,"Scott,I think you will be happy either way. I have fished Cedar Lake for the last 7 years and have found the walleye fishing to be very good. June of 2009 was a trip to remember. The second night that we were there, we caught just over 50 fish in under two hours and only two of them were under 18""....the rest were in the 20-23"" range with a couple right around 26"". Basically that was the story for the rest of the week. We only keep the smaller walleyes for the frying pan and this year it proved to be a challenge finding those smaller fish. It was an absolute blast. We stay at Jerry & Ellie's Cedar Lake Camp. If you want a modern, clean camp run by great people this is your place. They are a large part of the reason that we keep returning every year. From what I have read online, I don't think that you would be disappointed with Wabaskang either. Just my two cents worth. Good luck with your decision."
1122736,teddi,2009-07-21 14:30:00,349,i would check out sleepy dog cabins on wabaskange. tommy is a good guy and knows the lake well [ lived there all his life ]. or you can check the sunset country website for other options on the lake. if you are stuck on the lake Tommy would be the man to call.
1122771,MartyT,2009-07-21 16:13:00,23,"We're heading up to Peffley's Camp on Wabaskang Lake in a couple of days - I'll give a full report when I get back, but if the level of attentiveness and service that Dave Peffley has offered in advance of our trip are any indicators, I'm certain that we're going to have a great stay. I've spoken to Dave a couple of times last winter prior to booking for nearly an hour each time and he freely shared information and helped me make the decision on when and where to book. Plus I've emailed him quite a few times in the last few weeks and always got a response in just a couple of hours."
1122782,teddi,2009-07-21 17:04:00,349,"i would still try sleepy dog. it dosn,t hurt to shop around. i know both camp owners and they are both very good. i tend to sway towards sleepy dog because they are more in the middle and you dont,t have a lot of boat time."

1123188,Kevin R,2009-07-23 07:19:00,305,"I thought last year was great in July but this sounds even better. 50 Walleyes for how many fishing & live bait or what bait used ? I will be up in a few days, last year they hit almost anything with large lures getting the 25"" or larger Walleyes."
1123200,lonewolf73,2009-07-23 07:48:00,17,"Kevin,All walleyes were caught on a jig and minnow. Most of the time we were using 1/8 oz. chartreuse & orange jigs unless the wind really picked up and then we switched to 1/4 oz. Plain chartreuse or green & chartreuse also worked as well. There were only two of us fishing for the week. The fish this year seemed to have a little extra fight in them as well. I have been fishing walleyes since I was a kid and have never seen walleyes put up as much of a fight as they did this year. Some of the fish this year would make runs like a northern would and just strip yard after yard of line off your reel. Like I had said in my original post, every day was an absolute blast. We didn't catch as many northern as usual but those that we did catch had some size to them. The largest northern (7 1/2 lbs.)for the week was caught up in Carter (Nelson) Lake on the far end out in front of the inlet. Walleyes were caught just about everywhere off of points and around islands with depths running from 5 to 12 feet. Also caught a good number of fish casting crankbaits. Good luck with your trip. I'm already fired up for next years' trip!!!"
1123670,Kevin R,2009-07-24 19:43:00,305,"Thanks for the info. I have not used any minnows for many years but I know many say they are the best bait. I did very good on large lures the big Walleyes over 25"" would blast them like a Pike. Never caught a lot each day but lost track when I counted past 20 over 25"" for my trip about 5 over 27"" with 28"" being the largest. Only caught a few less than 16"" & lots of 17-24"" on smaller baits. I heard someone landed a 31"" at another camp last year. I had one pull off at the boat that looked to be over 30"". I would like to get a 30"" this year."
