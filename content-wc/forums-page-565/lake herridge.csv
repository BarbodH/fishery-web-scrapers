I will be taking a combo bear hunt/ fishing trip there at the end of august- early sept. . Any info as to baits used, techniques, or early fall/late summer patterns would be helpful. Live bait or lures? Mainly targeting 'eyes, pike, and smallies, and possibly lake trout. Anybody know what the forage base in these lakes would be? Also, misc. items you thought were helpful on these trips. Will be using the lodge boats so bringing my own anchor, drift sock(S), and vexilar(only portable I have), and my thermocell. Should be a great trip and any feedback is welcome. Thanx in advance and will try to post a report upon my return. eyecrosser"

Our group was there in 2001...we didn't do great on Lake Herridge, but it was only the 2nd trip for our group so I'm sure we weren't using the best techniques. No depthfinders, no bottom bouncing...we were probably lucky to get anything in the boat now that I think back on how we were fishing Best luck that we had was in the bay that Lake Herridge Lodge is in..just inside the mouth of the bay. Seemed like a popular spot..not many boats on the lake but in the evening they all seemed to be in this area. Caught some walleyes here mainly on worm harnesses. Best fishing we ran into was on one of the back lakes...Wassikina I think it was? Lots of good sized smallmouth and a few walleye back there. So if you run into tough fishing on the main lake I'd definitely suggest looking into trying to one of the back lakes. Was definitely worth it and made the trip!"
