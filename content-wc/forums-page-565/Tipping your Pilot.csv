1122335,Jig Man,2009-07-20 08:17:00,95,"For those of you that do a fly-in what do you normally tip the Pilot? Do you tip him on the way in, way out or both? Our standard amount had been $40 and just on the way in. Wondering if this was about right."
1122350,onetimedave,2009-07-20 09:40:00,502,We tip $20.00 US on way in. Also on way out if we have a different pilot.
1122390,Guest,2009-07-20 11:54:00,0,We always tip $5 per person.. Coming in and going out..
1122447,phishfearme,2009-07-20 15:55:00,1242,if the pilot is also the outfitter we include the tip in th overall trip tip - if an independent operator/pilot - $25 to $50 depending on the situation. last week the pilot waiting for th wind to due down in the evening an was still willing to take us out late - worth $50. phish
1122459,Hot Runr Guy,2009-07-20 16:41:00,16062,Tipping the Pilot helps him remember where he left you Priceless! HRG
1122469,Nimstug,2009-07-20 17:09:00,2605,Would it be so bad if he forgot you for a week or so?
1122472,Hawkfan,2009-07-20 17:24:00,237,Our group of 6-8 usually tips $40-$50 American both on the way in and way out. A good flight is well worth the money and we want to do our part to keep those pilots happy where they are.
1122673,Stauff,2009-07-21 11:22:00,110,"I'm embarrassed.......not once have we even thought about tipping the pilot! What else am I missing out on in Canadian fishing etiquette? To Don and the other pilots, I apologize! I didn't know!!!"
1122688,515,2009-07-21 12:38:00,254,"Don't feel bad Stauff we never thought of it till a few years ago either. We give the tip after landing on the lake to begin the week and if the pilot was nice enough to give us a quick fly around the lake to see the layout his tip will reflect that. We once asked a pilot for a quick fly around, his response was this plane flys for $450 an hour if you want to pay me that. I though geeze we just paid close to $5000 bucks for this week rental of a cottage and flight it was the least he could do. Needlass to say his tip reflected his response and we never fly again with that outfitter because of the attitude. Sorry to bring up another question but do anyone tip the dock crews that load and unload the planes at the base?"
1122822,SinOrSwim,2009-07-21 19:47:00,1528,"We have the guy who catches the smallest fish tip on the way back out. So, Hawkfan has tipped every year he has gone."
