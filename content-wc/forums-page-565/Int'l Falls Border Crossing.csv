1123083,Electricman56,2009-07-22 17:19:00,1,"I've been to Canada over 20 times, been to Sioux Narrows twice now, did the house boat thing. Mostly walleye fishing. Haven't been to Canada for 4 years now but going in September to Sioux Narrows (Lebron's Long Bay Camp). First time there and would like to find some smallies this trip, last 2 times on Lake of the Woods never caught any, any suggestions? I have a Hot Spots map for reference if that works."
1123251,Larry Mac,2009-07-23 10:34:00,530,"Hi Electricman56, I have never fished Lake of the Woods before but have heard and read that it is one of the best Freshwater Fisheries in the world. You must be excited.We fished Smallmouth this past June 20th in Perrault Falls Ontario. This may sound elementary but my son (14yrs old) and I fish Smallmouth with a slip bobber and a leech. Our best day was 84 fish, the largest being 18 1/2"". My son lost one that had to be 20"" or better right at the boat (Dad was the net man and he did not talk to me for 1 1/2 hours after that) but that's another story LOL. We always try to keep our presentations as simple as possible. Have a great trip and take care. We are leaving for Sioux Lookout in (7) days for our August trip. I am sure the lodge owner will put you on the Smallmouth and you will catch plenty. I do not need to tell you how aggressive those fish are and the beauty is they also school. Again have a great trip.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1123725,Kevin R,2009-07-25 07:03:00,305,We crossed at International Falls yesterday at 3:30 pm the wait 25-30 minutes was twice as long as it was last year at about the same time as was the line to wait in. Way more traffic on the roads & all rooms booked at the Holiday Inn in Dryden. The mill in Dryden is shut down but will be opening again very soon.
1076043,Basser,2009-01-25 20:08:00,31,Our outpost trip this year has us crossing at Int'l Falls on Sat. afternoon July 4th. Are we going to have a massive wait to cross on a Holiday weekend Saturday? I've never gone through on a Holiday weekend before. Basser
1076048,prov1900,2009-01-25 20:25:00,544,"Coming into the US? Don't know if the holiday would affect it much, but I think the I-Falls cross is pretty busy in the afternoon, period. Throw in the new passport regs and I would imagine you are facing a wait. Of course that probably will be everywhere. Last spring we braved the moose(s) and left our camp super early. We hit I-Falls at about 0630 and had zero traffic. I don't recommend the travel at oh dark thirty and I will not be doing it this year. That stunk."
1076079,Dan G,2009-01-26 06:10:00,31,"Dear Basser:I cross at I-falls all the time. A couple of things for you to keep in mind.....Saturdays are the turn-over days for housekeeping resorts. It will be busy crossing there from 10 a.m. to probably 4 p.m. or so. If you can cross the border in the wee hours of the morning....you likely will have a very minimal wait....going IN to Canada. Returning to the U.S., if you are returning on a Saturday...it will be brutal probably starting as early as 8 a.m. Many peeople get the ""great"" idea to leave the resort, ""early"". Well...if you leave at 6 a.m. or so, this will get you to the border just when everyone else is there. Either travel really, really early....or enjoy your day, and leave late. Your stay at the border will be shorter, and your stress level will be lower!I have found that traveling to Canada on July 4 to essentially be a non-event. Just because it is a holiday in the States....does not necessarily equate to be heavier than normal traffic to and from Canada. It is a weekend, traffic will be heavier than during the week. But, if you travel at odd times you won't have as much vehicle traffic. Many people travel to International Falls later in the day....stay there over night, then leave early, early, early. If you decide to do this....call ahead to make a reservation....because.....they fill up quick. I've seen many, many a boat trailer parked out in front of these hotels and motels on my way through at 2 or 3 in the morning! You will have more deer and moose to content with....but if you can live with that....your down time at the border will be minimal. If you are traveling after June 1, 2009.....DON'T FORGET TO HAVE YOUR PASSPORTS!!! Good Fishing! Oh, yes....it behooves me to mention Lake of the Woods...where I have my cabin......some absolutely fantastic smallie fishing out of the Sioux Narrows area. Red Indian Lodge is jut down the road from my place and a great place to stay!"
1076092,Glenman12,2009-01-26 07:16:00,762,"Our trip to Perrault Falls is 6 days, Sat-Fri and we leave from the Chicago area..for years we would pull out around 6AM on Friday and take our time on the way up..long breakfast around Mauston, long lunch in Eau Claire..we would get to the border around 6PM and usually have about a half hour wait...we would cross and spend the night in Ft Frances and then go the rest of the way up on Sat morning..the following Fri morning we would pull out of camp around 5AM, but we would always get that long wait crossing back into the states.. Last year we tried something completely different that really worked out well for our group..we left on Friday morning at 4:30AM..drove straight thru only stopping for gas and a drive thru McDonalds for a late breakfast..we got to the border just before 3:00PM and got across in 10 mins..we continued on to Vermillion Bay and stopped there for dinner..then we continued on up and were at our resorts boat dock by 7PM..what that did was give us a whole extra morning of fishing on Sat............coming back, instead of leaving early Friday morning, we had dinner at 4PM on Thursday and were on the road by 5PM..we were at the border by 7:15 crossed in minutes and spend the night in Int Falls and then drove home the next morning..worked out really well for us"
1076218,Mohleye,2009-01-26 15:23:00,368,"Glenman, I assume you must have made prior arrangements with your camp to arrive on Friday night? To the original poster: I've made a lot of crossings at IF the past 25 years mostly on Thursday or Friday at various times. I can never remember a wait longer than 30 minutes, although have been pulled over and searched several times which took some additional time. Entering the US from Canada at Ft Frances on Saturday has been a different story. Many long waits. However the past 2 years the waits have been very almost nonexistent, even though they were late morning. Maybe US Customs has increased staffing during peak times, and I'm sure numbers have to be down due to economics. Before I'd consider driving in the wee hours to avoid a long border wait on the way home, I'd be interested to hear what others have experienced the last 2 years. That's a rough way to start a long drive home, and the moose danger is very real all the way to Ft Frances."
1076234,Dan G,2009-01-26 16:20:00,31,"I agree....the moose and deer at night are a real concern. But, I will differ on you about crossing. I've seen some very long waits at the border....especially coming back into the U.S. at I-falls. Was once backed up to the McDonalds in the Fort. That was 2.5 hours to cross. This, of course was on a Saturday...the housekeeping turnover day. But, I had no choice that day. So, if one is careful as to the day they cross, doesn't necessarily need to be ""wee"" hours."
1076236,Glenman12,2009-01-26 16:26:00,762,"Yes, prior arrangements were made with the lodge.."
1076400,Mohleye,2009-01-27 07:59:00,368,"I said in my post that I've had some very long waits on Saturday crossing back to the US. Many times past the McDonalds and 4 years ago past the city limits, waited over 3 hours. I only said that the past 2 years the waits have been practically non-existent, and they were at peak time Saturday."
1076606,Guest,2009-01-27 20:03:00,0,"If you are going into Canada and cross before 8AM on Saturday, there should be no problem. Coming back from camp at Ear Falls, we left at about 3AM to get to the border early, then parked over at the Safeway because it is before 7AM when the tax free shop opens, picked up our liquor and crossed very shortly after that. The longest line was at the north end of the railroad bridge. It took about 10-15 minutes."
1076817,Adam Schlaeger,2009-01-28 18:34:00,4,For the most part the border is pretty busy. I have found that if you cross very early in the morning of Saturday that the wait is diminished greatly. Dan G is correct when he talks about how busy Saturday mornings are there. I typically leave Friday night and have a very little wait if any at the border when I get there. Depending on your resort you go to but most you have to be out by 8:00 am so it is not like you will get much fishing in so leaving friday night you are really not missing anything accept the long lines at the border.Adam
