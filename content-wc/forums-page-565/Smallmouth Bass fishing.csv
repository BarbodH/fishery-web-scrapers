I have seen a few reports that make me think they are primarily caught in the earlier summer period....is this accurate? Is there any reason to think that I shouldn't be able to get into them in fairly decent numbers in the NW part of Lac Suel...we'll be fishing the Bay of Islands, South Inlet, McKenzie Bay area. Would you look for them on rocky shorelines? What baits work best at Lac Seul....small crankbaits, tube jigs, grubs, in-line spinners such as rooster tail, night crawlers???Any sugguestions are appreciated."

When we've caught them in large numbers it almost always been along rockie shoreline with a twister tail and leech. We've also used crankbaits with good success. They like cover usually between or under rocks or under a sunken log. We fish the Southeastern side of Lac Seul around the Lost Lake, Webster Bay and Deceiption Bay area. Leave Friday morning can't wait. Have a good trip and good luck."
