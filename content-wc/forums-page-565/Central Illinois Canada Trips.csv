1122016,Obabikon,2009-07-18 15:34:00,2370,My wife will be driving back up next week. We live in Centralia (southern IL) in the winter time. It's a long trip... be safe and good luck!
1122018,SkeeterJeff,2009-07-18 16:25:00,31,"Not Illinois, but leaving from central Indiana on Thursday for Lady Evelyn Lake in east central Ontario. Good luck, be safe, and have fun. Jeff"
1122090,Hunter4,2009-07-19 07:11:00,65,"I'm from Carpentersville, Il. and my wife and two kids are heading up to Kenora. This trip is the highlight of our year. Sounds like the weather is going to be crap."
1122120,JMKC,2009-07-19 09:12:00,238,"Been going up to the Kenora area (LOW) for thirty years, live in the north Chicago suburbs. I know there is still road work on I-90 in Rockford, this year was easy sailing though. That EauClaire by-pass is a time saver. A little road work south of Cook, Minn., that's it as I recall. Have a good trip. JJ"
1122298,Babamel2,2009-07-20 05:57:00,414,We will be leaving for canada on Aug 21. Going to Dryden area. It is a long trip but the end result is wonderful. It is so great to be in good company out in the wilderness. the big unknown this year for me is that my wife will have laporoscopic surgery this week. Sure hope she is well enough to travel in a month.

1122714,Obabikon,2009-07-21 13:53:00,2370,"Atikwa Lake Lodge is a nice... less expensive, trip. Todd (the owner) is a very good person. He's a flyin camp that has (I believe) like 11 lakes (that are almost 100% uninhabited)... no cabins... one small minors camp somewhere. Anyhow, beautiful area, great people, good fishing. If it doesn't HAVE to be a fly in, and you might consider a boat in. www.obabikon.com I'd love to host you."
