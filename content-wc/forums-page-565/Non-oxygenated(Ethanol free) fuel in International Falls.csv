1123659,Kevin R,2009-07-24 18:57:00,305,Just put some high test pure gas from the fisherman in my boat it was about 2.90 a gal. They are on the south east corner of 53 in Internatonal Falls a mile or so from the border.
1123689,Guest,2009-07-24 21:06:00,0,Fill up with Non-Oxy Gold at the BP station just past Mcdonalds. It's 1/2 block north of the first stoplight right on Hwy 53.
