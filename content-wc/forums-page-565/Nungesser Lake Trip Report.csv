Very windy for the first few days, and cool and rainy to go along with more wind towards the end of the week. Only one ""nice"" weather day during the week. The fish didn't seem to mind though. We caught plenty of walleye in the usual spots like wind-blown points on jigs and rigs all tipped with minnows. A new twist this year was fishing in the river which is the outflow from Nungesser Lake. We tried the river to get out of the wind a few days and caught lots of walleye there, with a 26.5"" coming from there. Biggest walleye of the week was 27.5"", with quite a few 23"" and 24""'s. This was my second straight year fishing Nungesser Lake, and while I don't have a ton of comparisons, this seems like a great walleye lake. Roy at Birch Point did a great job for us, and he runs a good camp. He put us on fish all week, and even took my dad and son out with him for a half day Fri., (at no charge) and the two of them boated around 80 fish. My dad who is 83 boated 54 fish himself that morning. My dad (thin-blooded Floridian) struggled with the weather all week, and Roy went above and beyond to make sure he had a memorable last day. Can't wait to get back there. Tim"
