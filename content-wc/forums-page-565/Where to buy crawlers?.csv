1122775,MartyT,2009-07-21 16:19:00,23,"Can anyone recommend a bait shop where I can buy night crawlers in bulk, somewhere between Minneapolis and International Falls along the ""usual"" route (I-35 to Duluth then north on the smaller roads)? I'm assuming (boldly, I guess) that it'd be cheaper to buy them before getting to Dryden or Vermilion Bay but if someone can confirm that there's not much of a price difference I'll just wait. Thanks"
1122801,Moondog,2009-07-21 18:20:00,362,"You cannot bring crawlers into Canada unless they are packing in dirt free bedding. There were some people at camp that stopped at a bait shop in Orr, MN and picked up crawlers in Canadian approved bedding but not sure about bulk. The bait shop in Vermillion Bay is always good."
1122809,Gary from Iowa,2009-07-21 18:34:00,74,"I understand that Vados Bait, www.vadosbait.com offers crawlers in a Canadian Pack, foam container, gel pack, and dirt free bedding in various size containers. Their address: 7895 Hwy 65, Spring Lake Park, MN 55632; Phone 763-795-0110; Fax; 763-795-0325; toll free 1-866-584=3474. I have no connnection to Vados Bait but might buy some for our group tomorrow or Friday. Spring Lake Park is a suburb in the north part of the Twin Cities.Good luck on getting youir bait and hope the fishing is great for you.Gary"
1122810,SkeeterJeff,2009-07-21 18:44:00,31,"I've never used Vados crawlers, but have ordered leeches from 'em a couple of times and they were top notch, high quality. I recommend them highly. Jeff"
1122812,MartyT,2009-07-21 18:51:00,23,Thanks for the quick replies - looks like Vados Bait is just a few minutes away from where we'll be staying overnight on the way up. Guess we'll stop in along the way. Their website shows $37.99 for a half-flat (250) of nightcrawlers in Canada-approved bedding. Looks like a good price to me.
1122825,Guest,2009-07-21 20:01:00,0,Picked up a flat of worms. Top notch.
1122916,scar,2009-07-22 07:46:00,196,Cheapest and most convenient I have found are at Rogers Corner Kwik Stop 5 miles south of I Falls right on the highway. a full flat packed in bedding is $50. phone number to order is 218-377-4393.
1122917,Mohleye,2009-07-22 07:46:00,368,"If you're going as far as Ear Falls, a 1/2 flat of 250 is $37.00 Canadian at Four Seasons. We always brought crawlers from home but decided to try them for the first time last week. The quality was excellent. They need to know ahead of time on half or full flats, so PM me if you need a phone # or email address."
1123339,MartyT,2009-07-23 16:27:00,23,"Just got in from my stop at Vados Bait - picked up a half-flat of nightcrawlers for $37.99. Just a tiny little shop in a non-descript suburb of Minneapolis but the worms looked to be good quality, big and lively. So I think I'm all set. Thanks again for the recommendation!"
1123663,Kevin R,2009-07-24 19:16:00,305,$60 for a flat at the fisherman in International Falls never have had a bad batch. 8 doz in a container is about $19. They also sell small crawlers very cheap they are culls from the 8 doz & other packages.
