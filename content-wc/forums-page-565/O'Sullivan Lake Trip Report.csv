1122392,Bill Krejca,2009-07-20 12:05:00,6107,"Left Cedar Rapids July 10, 6:30PM, hit border early morn at Pigeon River. Official was man of few words - ""Wher ya goin?"" (near Nakina), 2 other questions and we were gone, same for the other 2 vehicles with us. Fished a bit Sat eve, after arriving about 2:30 pm to the drive-to resort, got a few walleyes. The next 3 days were very windy, mostly from the west, maybe 40mph?, felt like it anyway. The surface water temperature, which had been 74 degrees 3 weeks ago, was 55 when we got there. In spite of the temp drop and difficult conditions, fishing was not that bad, mostly walleyes and a few pike and whitefish, but we picked up 2 lake trout, one being 24"", while fishing for walleyes in about 30 ft of water. Used mostly Gulp 3""and 4"" minnows all week, smelt finish, jigged straight down, when practicable. Had one day of summer, a tee shirt day, then wind came back, mostly from the north, along with the periodic rain that followed us most of week. Air temp was in 40's at night, 60's during the day. Caught many fish in the low 20"", most everyone got one or more 22""-24"", largest walleye was 26"". The walleyes in this lake are the fightingest 'eyes that I have tangled with, they just don't seem to give up, and the first minute of the fight may find them just hanging to the bottom - I even had one jump - thought maybe I had a trout for a while! Met up with Walleye Central member ""Burdman"", who was also staying at O""Sullivan's Rainbow Lodge, and we shared some hot spots. Due to the cool weather, the mosquito population was down, very pleasant. On Friday the wind blew from the north and it rained some more, one of the best fishing days, in spite of the bad conditions. Booked a return trip for 8 for 2010, nice place, good fishing, accommodating hosts. Headed back home Sat morning, water temperature was way up to 59 degrees. Bill Krejca"

1122451,phishfearme,2009-07-20 16:00:00,1242,"bill - sounds like you had the same weather we had - and the same water conditions - the water temp dropped at least 15degF over two weeks - made for some ""different"" situations. glad you had a nice time though. phish"
1122689,515,2009-07-21 12:40:00,254,Thanks for the report Bill. We are heading up that way soon and were wondering about the cold weather and how the lake temps are doing.
1122700,hawks_rule,2009-07-21 13:19:00,115,"I returned from the same trip with Bill, great trip, great fishing, great company... . wishing I was still up there instead of working. Burdman was lucky enough to be able to spend two weeks. (I'm jealous)."
1122863,fishforlife,2009-07-22 00:57:00,77,"Talked with my outfitter tonight in Nakina, and he says the weather has been unseasonably cool for this time of year. Also said the fishing is still good. Will be leaving in 3-weeks for Brace Lake. The had some rough weather after the tornado in Lac Soul snapping some trees off, but no injuries or property damage. Anyone been to Brace Ara or Meta Lake this year, and how did you do? Thanks in advance for the report, and good luck to those yet to go."
