1122979,rockpt,2009-07-22 10:45:00,589,"Winnipeg Free Press - PRINT EDITION Family braces for heartbreak Man, 25, presumed drowned near Minaki By: Gabrielle Giroday 20/07/2009 1:00 AM | Comments: 9 Print EÂ–mail Share ThisDave Christopher Pundyk was a star volleyball player turned Winnipeg teacher who grew up in the footsteps of his mother and father. But his parents have almost certainly outlived him after a freak accident on the weekend near the Minaki, Ont., cottage that was their family's refuge. His father, John Pundyk, a St. Paul's High School teacher, and his mother, Brenda Pundyk, who is principal of Shaughnessy Park School, were at the family's cottage awaiting news Sunday night. Grieving family members and friends gathered near the oak coffee table Dave had carefully built for his mother and inlaid with a chess board. They waited for confirmation that the Sisler High School industrial arts teacher was dead and his body found. Brenda said her son had Cree heritage and had assisted with Sisler's aboriginal academic achievement program. John's voice broke as he described the 2007 graduate of Red River College and University of Winnipeg's five-year Industrial Arts/Technology Teacher Education program. John said his 25-year-old son was thrown from a boat into the Winnipeg River at about 3:30 a.m. Saturday. The accident happened when two boats travelling together collided after Dave's boat stalled, he said. ""I don't have much hope,"" John said. ""At a time (like this) you can't do anything but rely on your friends. That's all we have. I know David is not coming back...knowing the circumstances and knowing the area, it's not like he's in the middle of the wild and he's lost somewhere. ""It's cottage country and where the accident took place, you wouldn't get lost in it."" John said his family was ""devastated"" after they received word of the accident. His son's boat was travelling behind another boat when it stalled, he said. Dave restarted his boat and then it collided head-on with the other boat that circled back. ""I guess the guy in the other boat didn't know what happened or it was dark,"" John said. His son was with close friends when the collision occurred, his father said. John said emphatically his family does not blame the other boat's driver for the collision. ""I'm sure he feels guilty as heck,"" he said, adding he has been friends for decades with the youth's parents. ""Can you imagine how the poor kid feels? ""I'm sure he was blaming himself, but no one's to blame, except kids (make) some dumb decisions sometimes."" Two others were sent to hospital: A woman had a severely injured leg and another man received minor injuries. Three other adults on the boats were not injured. This September, his father said, Dave was to move to Grant Park High School as a teacher in the wood shop. Dave attended Kelvin High School so he could take shop classes. The family's cottage bears the fruits of Dave's talents, including a wood box that he crafted for his parents. Dave and his longtime girlfriend had been searching for an apartment to live together, his father said. ""He was a great boy,"" he said, describing his son's ""easy smile"" and respectful way. ""He was a real gentle kid... he respected others and so people respected him."" During his university career, Dave was captain of Red River College's Rebels varsity volleyball team. In 2005, he was selected as a Central Plains Athletic Conference league all-star. John said his two sons, including Dave's 30-year-old brother, Mike Pundyk, had planned to meet at the cottage to participate in a fishing tournament. ""Everything changed,"" John said. The two brothers were both mechanically inclined and loved the outdoors. John said police officers had begun a recovery operation for their son's body. The Minaki region is about 250 kilometres east of Winnipeg and known for its jagged rocks, towering pines and placid waterfront. ""(The Ontario Provincial Police) told us they've exhausted the rescue search,"" John said. ""They've been doing it... along the shorelines and up all the islands in the area."" John and Brenda Pundyk thanked ""unbelievable"" search crews who combed the area using a heat-seeking helicopter and dog teams. They said friends and family had poured into their cottage to offer their support. The din of their voices could be heard Sunday night. John called the community support ""overpowering."" ""We do have a very good group of great friends that are very supportive,"" Brenda said. ""We could not get through this without them, and it's still not over.""[email protected] Republished from the Winnipeg Free Press print edition July 20, 2009 A3"
1122985,Guest,2009-07-22 11:12:00,0,Thank you for the update. I was wondering if this was a fishing accident but that doesn't appear to be the case. Nothing good can happen at 3:30 am on a Saturday night out on the lake. What a tragedy.
1123281,Guest,2009-07-23 12:45:00,0,"I was staying at the cabins at Northstar fish camp where the accident happened. the wrecked boats were docked at the marina right next to mine. I read an Ontario paper that said the accident was head on, that is incorrect. The boat that the young man that lost his life in was T-boned at the steering wheel and the the other boat's bow was curled and bent radically. Obivously, they collided at a high rate of speed. It was a tragic ending in so many ways. A young man lost his life. His friend will live with that guilt forever, the families... The Winn. river chain is a beautiful, bountiful fishing destination but the images of that morning will prevent me from returning to those waters for awhile. Let this tragic accident remind us all to boat safely. Accidents happen in a spilt second be careful out there. God Bless."
