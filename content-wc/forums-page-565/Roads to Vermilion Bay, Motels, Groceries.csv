1122574,Kevin R,2009-07-21 06:38:00,305,I would not drive 502 at night. The last 3 out of 4 times I have used it I never had a car infront of me or behind me. The pot holes were bad in places sharp turns steep hills & criters. You need to drive 502 in daylight.
1122589,Mohleye,2009-07-21 07:21:00,368,They are working on 17 in several places between V-Bay and Dryden. Not sure about west of V-Bay.
1122295,Gary from Iowa,2009-07-20 05:37:00,74,"My brothers, nephew and I are driving into Ontario on Friday on our way to Bow Narrows, Red Lake, Ontario. We may go along Lake of the Woods, Kenora, to Vermilion Bay or we might go up Highway 502 to Dryden. We will need a motel for the 5 of us on Friday night. Any suggestions for a motel along the way? Are Friday night rooms hard to find in Dryden, Kenora or Red Lake. We need to be at the municipal dock in Red Lake by 2 pm Saturday-ready to go with our gear and groceries. Last year we drove to Dryden for fishing at Route Lake Lodge so we are comfortable with that road. We do not know the route between Dryden and Vermilion Bay. Is it a good road? Are there choices for roads? (We will be renting a large SUV)What grocery stores are good in Red Lake and what effect does Norsemen Days have on shopping and traffic?Your input is greatly appreciated.Gary"
1122310,WalleyeWally28,2009-07-20 06:46:00,298,My wife & I always stay at the Super 8 in Kenora. They have a large parking lot that works good for boats and RVs and a Caseys restaurant located right there so you don't have to hassle driving and parking to eat.
1122318,Mohleye,2009-07-20 07:36:00,368,"The road from Dryden to Vermillion Bay is the trans-Canada highway and is in excellent condition. There is some construction work ongoing. Hotel rooms are harder to come by on Friday nights than others due to all the fishermen doing the same thing you are doing. They may not be as hard to find this year, but I would start looking."
1122319,stevensinks,2009-07-20 07:44:00,330,Gary we could not find a room in Red Lake for Fri becouse of Norseman days. But we did find one in Balmer which they tell me is only about 5 miles away.
1122329,Steve Ediger,2009-07-20 08:00:00,97,"Gary from Iowa,Have you considered staying at Ear Falls? It is about an hour from Red Lake. The highway 105 Bar & Grill is a great place to eat and also has a motel. I guarantee you won't leave hungry. Wilsons fine foods and an LCBO is right around the corner in a strip mall. Mr. Wilson is a great guy and will have everything you need.Steve"
1122398,Mohleye,2009-07-20 12:33:00,368,"It sort of depends on how much you need to do before 2 PM on Saturday. Driving all the way to Ear Falls or Red Lake from Iowa is a pretty long day if you'll just end up killing time in Red Lake Saturday morning. Ft Frances, Kenora and Dryden have plenty of good hotels and grocery stores, and if you go the western route the Emo Inn in Emo is a nice place to stay. Sports bar/restaurant on site, LCBO next door, and a police station across the street and well-lit parking. As far as grocery stores in Red Lake, there are two. I haven't been to either in several years. The IGA was good with an excellent bakery, but I understand it has changed haands, so I'll leave it to others to provide info."
1122416,IowaDave,2009-07-20 13:49:00,69,"You didn't say what time of day you'd be traveling, so my only $.02 worth would be not to drive 502 in the dark if you can help it. I've done it a couple times & with critters that are out & about at night, it's 'intense' to say the least. If you're going during daylight it's a great drive (as you know) and the road's been fixed a lot even since last year."
1122433,Mohleye,2009-07-20 15:19:00,368,"Agree 100%. I've driven that road in the dark, and there are too many moose to do it unless it can't possibly be avoided."
1122438,tackleman,2009-07-20 15:23:00,444,"First off, Norseman days is a big event in Red Lake, the main street of the town will be closed off for traffic, the food store you want is Sobeys it is in the plaza on top of the hill as you come into town., the liquor store is in the same plaza and shares the parking lot with the food store, the beer store is just up from these stores,I think Bow Narrows picks up his guests ath the dock by chimo airways or Red Lake Marine so you shouldn't have any trouble loading and unloading.The Balmer motor hotel is a decent place to stay and it's only 10 minutes from red lake, but you could easily stay in Ear Falls as mentioned in an earlier posting.Also watch out for the moose and deer they're everywhere."
1122499,Hump,2009-07-20 19:01:00,578,"We go up 71 and then 17 across to vermillion Bay. Our destination is Ear Falls. Northside motel is nice and clean and a couple of different restaurants in town. Does anyone know f they are still working on 17 and if so, is it still slow?"
