1122523,champ8,2009-07-20 20:30:00,40,"I'm headed up to LOW in a couple of weeks and I'm considering spending a day at Obabikon Lake, but am a little nervous about that infamous rock that sits in the river between Obabikon and LOW. It doesn't seem to show up on my Lakemaster Chip. Does anyone have the GPS coordinates to help me avoid losing my prop?"
1122536,MikeMcC,2009-07-20 21:09:00,72,"champ, I was just there Sunday for my first time. The Lakemaster chip is a great help, but the real narrow section is too small to be depicted on the chip. You should be ok if you stay close to the left side of this narrow chute. When you get there you will see what I mean. When I say close I mean within a foot or so of the left side. I made it thru with a deep boat (Lund Tyee)and stainless steel prop. Once thru you can power up. It is a fun lake to explore and fish. Sorry I don't have the GPS coordinates available. Have fun!"
1122577,Obabikon,2009-07-21 06:50:00,2370,"There isn't one rock in the narrows. There's about 15 hittable rocks on the EAST side of the narrows. Stay on the west side as close to the shore line as possible. (your boat should be about 12-24 inches from rubbing the point). That's the deepest part of the narrows, and the only area that is safe. If you have a very expensive boat, I suggest you use your trolling motor to go through. Either way, it's a trip worth making. If you'd like me to point out a couple spots to get bigger northern, feel free to stop by the camp. I'm Jared."
1122618,champ8,2009-07-21 08:38:00,40,Thanks for the info Mike MCc and Jared. I can't wait to get up there.
1122632,rockpt,2009-07-21 09:10:00,589,"If you're in a tiller, it's easier to back thru. If console, strongly recommend raising your motor and using the bow mount. Much easier to see the rocks as you go by them. Also, make sure your trolling motor batteries are fully charged. If there's a strong south wind there will be a good current flowing into Obabikon and you'll need full power to pull you out against the current."
1122746,Moondog,2009-07-21 14:54:00,362,Are there any maps available to that we can look at what we are talking about? I have never been to the area near Obabikon. Interested tho.
1122756,Obabikon,2009-07-21 15:28:00,2370,http://www.obabikon.com/map4.jpg Not a very good map... but it shows the area.
1122804,1shooter,2009-07-21 18:27:00,1493,You have nothing to worry about. Yes if your not carful you could cause some damage but if you take your time you will not have a problem. Our fising group goes through there several times a year with no problems. All 18' plus boats with big motors. Trim your motor up and you will be fine.
1122841,rockpt,2009-07-21 20:59:00,589,"The other tip is if you have a dog, keep him on a leash as you go thru. A few falls ago, our dog jumped out onto the big boulder on the left as we were going thru. We kept going and she had to jump in and swim to catch up. Still laugh about that one."
