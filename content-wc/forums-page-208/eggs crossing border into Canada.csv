5245210,rzep,2016-12-30 09:16:00,1196,"Yes... why would anyone bring eggs to CAN ? Just the aspect of keeping them at the right temps and not cracking would keep me away. Seems to me that fresh ""eggs"" are not perfect food for ""roughing it""."
5245298,Crackback,2016-12-30 09:44:00,257,Really? Then why do you even bother with 5 dollars worth of eggs from the U.S. when you can just eliminate the hassle and buy your eggs in Canada??????
5245330,Ricky Spanish,2016-12-30 09:49:00,1298,"My guess would be so as not to have to stop for groceries. The only stops I ever make are for gas/bathroom, border crossing, and one time a moose."
5245370,btyreprich,2016-12-30 10:00:00,1067,"For our group, not buying eggs in Canada is a matter of: Cost Convenience Time Not saying our way of doing things is right for everyone. However for us it works out nicely. Happy New Year everyone."

5248378,Multispecies Guy,2017-01-01 11:34:00,447,Not that they'd make it all the way home anyway.
5242490,revitup,2016-12-28 11:11:00,140,Will be coming into Canada over the upcoming holiday so wondering if we can bring eggs across the border and if so are there any restrictions or rules related to bringing them across? Thanks in advance.
5242674,Guest,2016-12-28 13:07:00,0,they won't ask so why tell them?
5242810,The tank,2016-12-28 13:47:00,340,Last i seen the only state that still had a restriction was eggs from Indiana. I would bet that thay have been ok'd by now.
5242914,btyreprich,2016-12-28 14:27:00,1067,"Indiana is all that I could find as being states from which poultry products are not allowed. When buying eggs for our trips, I always made sure the carton shows what state the eggs came from. Took a bit more work, but I just did not want the hassle of having to throw the eggs away at the border any buying more in Fort Frances. Sure the border guards might not ask you specifically about eggs - but if they decide to search the car for whatever reason and see eggs from Indiana, don't you think they search the vehicle & boat even more closely?"
5242970,revitup,2016-12-28 16:04:00,140,"Sorry--I can't live my life that way--intentionally breaking the law and then saying ""Sorry"" if I get caught. Especially over $5 worth of groceries."
5243250,Guest,2016-12-28 23:57:00,0,I just checked with the CBSA food search for Gallus domesticus / chicken eggs. even from Indiana they are approved. Max amount allowed in 30 doz. you can expect to pay duty on more than 2 doz eggs per person. That being said. Things can change over night and the web sight may not be up dates right away. There could be an emergency flash sent to the CBSA officers at all crossings. And the site not be updated.
