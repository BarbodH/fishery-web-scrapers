I watch a few outfitters websites today and none mentionne anything about it. It's a good incentive that they don't use! There is a fishing & hunting show in February so I will take the opportunity to talk to them.

Provinces which have an HST program where the GST and provincial sales tax (PST) are harmonized you get a 50% refund on the HST paid. Provinces which only charge GST, ie Alberta you will get a 50% refund on the GST. Provinces which have a separate GST and PST charged ie British Columbia, You will only get a 50% refund on the GST paid in that province. No rebate on the PST paid. Check out here for the taxes in the different provinces and territories:http://www.calculconversion.com/sale...r-hst-gst.html"
