5248898,Crackback,2017-01-01 23:52:00,257,"Really? Because people get a little sick of guys coming here asking the same old redundant question for the last 6 months thinking anything has changed! There has to be a least 15+ Canadian fish camp questions/recommendations since the summer, i have never seen the same question asked so much so recently. ....the SEARCH function is a marvelous tool....people should use it more often rather than thinking their question is the rediscovery of the wheel..."
5248906,Crackback,2017-01-02 00:00:00,257,So now you resort to name calling because people hate the same question over and over.....classy!
5248994,Multispecies Guy,2017-01-02 06:30:00,447,"Don't like certain threads? Skip them and move on. No need to be rude. Resorts close, change ownership or upgrade cabins/boats frequently. Plus, every time a new thread is opened it gets the attention of a new set of readers. I joined this site quite recently and I suspect many others have as well. New members bring experience and insight and there's nothing wrong with getting their input on lodges/lakes. I'd be willing to bet that every thread that bothers some so much contained info that wasn't in any other thread. Readers can pull up old threads to get some answers and then start a new thread and get even more answers. Not sure why some can't skip over threads that don't interest them without being negative. Happy New Year"

5249466,fsz,2017-01-02 11:05:00,144,"Exactly...don't like a thread, skip it! Not everyone can read or post to the site every day. So, doesn't matter if the same question is asked more than once. Those who want to answer can. We have moderators for a reason. They filter inappropriate posts. Gotta problem with a reply or thread...contact the moderators"
5249498,Obabikon,2017-01-02 11:23:00,2370,"I would argue that every time one of these is posted... it is not at all the same thread. There are different criteria all the time. This specific poster wanted a multi-species lake with really good small mouth bass, pro guide, meals, everything included for $2,000 per person. Does not want to troll. Leaning mostly Rainy Lake of LOTW. It'd be pretty hard to find a thread that was this specific. If you're not interested in reading these types of threads... don't. It takes you zero time, and it inconveniences you in absolutely no way. Simply skip any thread that states IN IT'S TITLE... ""lodge suggestions""."
5249674,Pooch,2017-01-02 13:45:00,4618,What Obadikon said. ^^^^ There is a gazillian members and all have a different experience to share at different times.Pooch
5241650,Daveygravy,2016-12-27 16:03:00,88,"Thank you for the detailed suggestions! We went to hawk lake a few years ago. The bass fishing was very good and Ted runs a class operation. Problem is my dad can't do portage lakes very well anymore . I mainly need the guide to run the boat ,so I can help my dad tie on baits , get him un snagged etc..."
5241690,Multispecies Guy,2016-12-27 17:41:00,447,"According to the All Canada website, under lodge search, neither of those resorts will be attending. Perhaps the resort list isn't complete/accurate."
5241762,Obabikon,2016-12-27 18:28:00,2370,"Without a doubt, I will be at the All Canada show in St. Charles in a couple weeks. One of my favorite shows! It sounds like we would absolutely fit the bill. As far as guided fishing goes, we have some of the best on staff. As far as being ""aggressive"" goes... it really depends on when, and what species. You will mostly jig for walleye, but can cast crank baits if you'd like. Bass, pike, musky will all be casting banks, rocks and weed beds. So, there's plenty to go get. Also, our pricing is well within your max range, and you can't get much closer of a drive than Morson Ontario. Feel free to PM or email me if you have any questions."
5241794,wellpastcold,2016-12-27 18:43:00,1351,"Witch Bay Camp rocks. Steve and Gayle run a first class operation. If you enjoy being looked after in every way while fishing some awesome water, check them out. Great value, solid service and you are treated like royalty. You won't be disappointed."
5241802,Fisherman Ted,2016-12-27 18:51:00,461,I will not be at the show. We have never attended a sport show actually. That being said give me a call anytime. Right now I am watching hockey and would be happy to talk to you. In terms of portage lakes we have 3 that you drive a quad to which is a complete blast (and no walking) and at least 6 others less than 100 yards long. Plus the main lake which is epic as Brett alluded to. -Fisherman Ted Hawk Lake Lodge
5245338,Crackback,2016-12-30 09:49:00,257,There are enough past posts and lodge/camp recommendations galore than to keep asking the same old questions...use the search feature....you will find more than what you are looking for.
5245362,ziggyzag,2016-12-30 09:59:00,125,Crackback: Whats the problem with his question?? maybe he wants to hear from someone personally. If it is such a boring question why are you responding at all then!!!!!!
5245498,Daveygravy,2016-12-30 10:58:00,88,Thanks ziggy zag!! I have gone through old posts for hours. Things change over time Crackback.
5245602,Multispecies Guy,2016-12-30 12:15:00,447,"Sorry, looked for you under ""O"", didn't realize you were at the top of the list under your resort's full name. Enjoy the show."
5245754,ziggyzag,2016-12-30 13:24:00,125,Daveygravy: I know what your saying. Last year when I was checking on a trip destination I to searched this sight and found a lot of good information. Then posted asking for additional information which led me into being able to talk to a couple of fellow fishermen who had been there recently and they shared there insight which I greatly appreciated. Yes I agree things do change over time. Good luck in finding the perfect spot. Dont let people like Crackhead make you feel uncomfortable in asking for help.
5240562,Daveygravy,2016-12-26 18:48:00,88,"Looking to do a trip with my dad this summer: It needs to be a guided American plan trip (Probably 4 to 5 days ), about 2000 max per person and not a real long drive. A multi species lake that has real good smallmouth fishing is what we're looking for. I have researched some places on low and rainy lake. My concerns are: Can you get away from the masses on these popular lakes? and are there guides that like to fish more aggressively ? Or do most drag bait around? ( never used a guide before ). I mentioned low and rainy , but am open to others as well. Your experiences and suggestions are appreciated."

5240954,Larry S,2016-12-27 07:32:00,665,Try Hawk Lake Lodge close to Kenora
5241114,The tank,2016-12-27 08:53:00,340,I would call Dale at Labelles Birch point camp on rainy lake. He will tell you staight up if he has what your looking for. 807 486 3345. Smallmouth fishing is second to none.
5241250,Mike Borger,2016-12-27 11:21:00,1554,"1. Obabikon Bay Camp on LOTW. Have researched this facility to death and have heard nothing but glowing reviews. I'm visiting it myself next year. http://obabikon.com/2. Already mentioned, Hawk Lake Lodge. They have 19 adjacent back lakes with boats/motors on them with some really incredible smallmouth bass fishing.http://hawk-lake.com/"
5241282,Daveygravy,2016-12-27 11:40:00,88,Obabikon and labelles are on my radar. I'm going to look for them at the all canada show in St charles. Shoal lake is very interesting also ( have any of you fished there? ). Been to hawk lake .
5241370,Cil,2016-12-27 12:22:00,10,Check out Pipestone Lake just across the border boat in no pressure only 2 resorts on the whole lake multi species
5241538,MN_Moose,2016-12-27 14:49:00,964,Maybe Witch Bay. They have a unique guide experience. I have never stayed there.
5241546,bthomas3333,2016-12-27 15:12:00,465,"I fished both Witch Bay and Hawk Lake last year in Early June back to back 4 day trips, they are only 45 mins apart. Both are very well run and offer good SM fishing. Maybe I was just lucky with our timing on Hawk but the SM fishing was fantastic. We had a couple of afternoons where my buddy and I caught 50+ SM with the average size being ~17. The average size was amazing. All three of us had a 19in in 4 days. Throw in the trophy size walleyes which is what Hawk is known for early in the season. I also fished Witch Bay and the SM fishing was good / pike was very good. The guide program at Witch bay is pretty cool. You ask for help and they assign you a guide who takes you out for half day / full day. Once they give you a few spots and techniques it gets you going. The best part is the cost (free). Of course we tipped a good bit since we enjoyed the experience and he did a good job. Guides as you know at Hawk are extra.I can only speak to my experience but if I wanted to target Pike / Muskie / eater size Walleye my choice would be Witch Bay. If I wanted to target Smallies or big Walleye I would prefer Hawk.My two cents from June 2016.B-"
5241562,The tank,2016-12-27 15:23:00,340,"Im going to put another one out there. Try lost lake lodge. It's alittle farther drive but walleye, pike and smallmouth fishing can be awsome."
