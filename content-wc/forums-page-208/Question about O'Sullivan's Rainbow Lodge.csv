5228858,MrSimon,2016-12-15 06:49:00,922,"Yup, I'm aware of the outpost .... it looks great! But I'm still interested in if they run a loud generator at the main camp. That lodge sure does look amazing though!"
5229026,Pooch,2016-12-15 08:23:00,4618,"I have not been to O'Sullivan for years, but I do not remember ever hearing their gen set. They might even be on the hydro by now. The outpost cabin wasn't all that far from the camp and back then had no shower. Guys from outpost came back into main camp to shower every few days. Bill Krejka is on this board and is very up on the camp. Sooner or later he will get up from his nap and help answer your questions. Pooch"
5229050,Bill Krejca,2016-12-15 08:34:00,6107,"Huh? What?..........Where are I? In answer to the generator: It runs 24/7. It is very quiet, not at all noticeable (at least to me). Seriously, it is far enough away to not be a factor. I'm not even sure where it is, it is that quiet. The outpost is about 5 miles away, in a great part of the lake. Nobody around at all in the evening, nice beach, no shower needed if the weather is warm. I've thought about staying at the outpost, just never did. I do think I might bring a generator to the outpost for charging batteries, tho. Fishing is good. Bill"
5236713,Erie Ranger620,2016-12-22 19:51:00,74,A little late to the party but agreed no problem with the generator it's a sweet camp we'll run and well maintained and super fishing I have a blog of all my years there hard to beat this drive to camp with the tons of islands and miles to explore here's my OS blog http://walleyewarriorcanada.blogspot.com/
5236729,Live to jig,2016-12-22 20:01:00,159,"You will not be sorry if you can book a week here, our cabin is probably the closest to the generator and I can easily hear the loons out on the the lake while laying in my bunk with the all the windows open. Counting the days till we can head back up there."
