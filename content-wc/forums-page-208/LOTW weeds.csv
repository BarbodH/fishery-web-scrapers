5234994,Obabikon,2016-12-21 10:26:00,2370,"I saw more cabbage this year than I have seen in 5-10. So either it is indeed making a comeback, or the rusty crayfish never got thick enough to completely wipe them out. Either way, the big red leaf cabbage is coming back."
5235154,rwl,2016-12-21 12:21:00,1655,"Point taken, but sounds like something a bass fisherman would say."
5235162,rwl,2016-12-21 12:26:00,1655,"Good to hear, I was just dreaming about hitting my favorite spots north of Sabaskong Bay and thinking of the last 2-3 years of a lot of them with zero weeds."
5235242,Ricky Spanish,2016-12-21 13:21:00,1298,Low blow. That seemed intentionally hurtful.
5235298,rwl,2016-12-21 14:03:00,1655,"Now I feel bad, at Christmas time too. I actually would be fine with EVERY other boat on the lake fishing for only bass."
5235546,pale ryder,2016-12-21 18:28:00,1937,"Buck Perry was a bass fisherman, and he practically invented structure fishing. Merry Christmas."
5235633,pale ryder,2016-12-21 20:19:00,1937,I didn't know there was any argument.
5233898,rwl,2016-12-20 10:19:00,1655,"I've been going to LOTW's every year at least once a year, usually twice, since 1989. The last few years things have changed in some areas a lot. Like bays that were full of cabbage weeds now have none. Some saddle areas and weedbeds on beaches have been weed free for the last 2-3 years. Anybody know why the weeds are gone, for sure? I've been told it is crayfish eating them, the water levels etc. I've seen extreme water levels in the past with no change, except for the incredibly high water two years ago. Maybe someone with more history or other parts of the lake may have seen this, is it a cycle? I had spots that were a for sure spot during the weeks I've been there, but are now just baren areas devoid of any structure. Just wondering if some of my prime musky spots will recover with some good cabbage?"
5233914,Bill Krejca,2016-12-20 10:31:00,6107,"Weed disappearance has been generally credited to the spread of the rusty crayfish, as suggested above. Bill"
5234018,rwl,2016-12-20 11:29:00,1655,"Do the weeds come back? Do the crayfish move on when the weeds are gone. To return when they regrow. Some of these spots have been dead for a few years. I'm wondering if anyone noticed a spot barren for a year or two, then return to something of its former self?"
5234026,v-bay gord,2016-12-20 11:59:00,3168,"I've been told from someone with experience on LOW that the effects of rusty crayfish will mitigate over time as the initial population explosion collapses. Will it be the same as before the introduction, probably not. We have the same issue on portions of Eagle Lake."
5234258,pale ryder,2016-12-20 17:19:00,1937,"I have seen the effect of rusty crayfish on several Wisconsin lakes. They have a huge impact on weeds and the fishery. They are cyclical but the cycle is 20+ years or more. First the population explodes, wiping out weeds and eating fish and fish eggs. then they die down some and weeds come back. But not the nice cabbage instead less desirable weeds followed by cabbage weeds much later on. The fishing can still be very good but locations change with the change in weed cover. Also, just FYI. Weeds are not structure. Structure is changes in depth. Points, humps, flats, drop offs, etc.. Weeds, rock, wood, etc.. are cover."
5234386,Obabikon,2016-12-20 19:33:00,2370,"Some of weed beds that hadn't had weeds in 5 years or more... had them last year. Not all of them, but some. This of course is only in the Sabaskong/Miles Bay area that I know about."
5234394,Obabikon,2016-12-20 19:35:00,2370,Ahh... the structure vs. cover argument
5234706,Bill Krejca,2016-12-21 07:24:00,6107,A rose by any other name...would still smell as sweet. Bill
5234722,jambi,2016-12-21 07:33:00,504,It's not a crayfish to me. It's a crawfish. I do love cabbage beds though.
5234730,Ricky Spanish,2016-12-21 07:39:00,1298,"[weed] /wid/ noun. 1. a valueless plant growing wild, especially one that grows on cultivated ground to the exclusion or injury of the desired crop. 2. the green stuff in willie nelson's pocket.OK, so I made up the 2nd one, but I don't think cabbage likes to be called a weed."
