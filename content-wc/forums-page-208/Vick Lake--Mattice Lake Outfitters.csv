I fished Auger Lake last year with Mattice Lake Outfitters, and had a fantastic week, albeit an ice-cold one, it being late May/early June.This might be a shot in the dark, but would appreciate any intel on this lake from someone who has fished it in the past couple years. I definitely wouldn't mind going back to Auger again, though. What I love about MLO is that they will take very small groups (last year, it was just my brother and I). Thanks for any info. anyone can provide!"
