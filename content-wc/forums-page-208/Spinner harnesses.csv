5230066,fsz,2016-12-16 07:27:00,144,"You are getting some good feedback. As far as using two blades, on Lake Erie the guys that ""pull meat"" as we call it use single larger colorado blades. If junk fish (sheephead white bass, etc) are a problem (as they often are), a double willow leaf blade combination is used because it works well at a faster speed to keep junk off. That can be a real problem on erie where literally at times a junk fish will bite every 5 minutes and the walleye never get a chance to see the presentation. Never heard of a double colorado set up though. Since junk fish are not the issue in NWO that they are in Erie, I wouldn't see any use for double willows there. My understanding the colorado blades, trolled slow, are your best bet day in and day out for walleye if junk fish aren't an issue."
5230130,Bobby Winds,2016-12-16 08:42:00,10817,I moved up to 20# floro too because of the rock piles I fish are covered with zebra mussels that cut 12# mono too easily.
5238482,drlee,2016-12-24 17:52:00,409,"Merry Christmas to you, as well! You are using the old fashioned walleye rig that was popular prior to the time that jigs became the go to bait. I love to fish with jigs, and find them to be very effective. However, when I fished Ottertail Lake in south western MN back in my childhood, my grandfather, who was a classic walleye fisherman, taught me to fish with a little joe type spinner bait, tipped with a minnow or crawler (or maybe even a leach in those days). We used a beaded trolling sinker and 6 pound test and caught a ton of walleye. I still use the same rig on Pashkokogan and Press Lakes north of Ignace, Ont. I catch an incredible number of walleye on these simple baits. I enjoy them because jigs relate to a slower, softer bite, while my little joe rigs produce dramatic strikes; a 15"" walleye can hit like a 3 lb northern and that is really fun! Single hook, beaded trolling sinker, related to the bottom + 6-10"" off, 1/2 crawler, or leach, or minnow (salt or live), and I can boat 50 per day, no problem. (of course, I must admit that there a slow days, as with any bait). I must admit that I really get a kick out of fishing, at least part of the time, with a bait that is outdated in the minds of most fishermen. History is often a good teacher. Have fun!"
5238578,billy weaver,2016-12-24 19:53:00,470,"My grandson and I have been tying some harnesses. I was asked the question, ""what determined which way the blade spins?"" I said I supposed it depended on which way it was oriented on the original start. I think he was thinking we could tie some with two blades one turning one way and one the other the other way. I said I didn't know and never heard of it."
5238634,pjshorthorn,2016-12-25 06:12:00,5654,"Here are some examples of my homemade spinner rigs. I have been using 12 lb mono, a 1/0 Aberdeen light wire hook,quick change plastic clevis, #5 Colorado blade , 8mm beads and a float glued to the head of the hook. I've been pulling these with a bottom bouncer and have done well enough to keep me interested in building more each season. Bait of choice has been a piece of crawler,but minnows have worked as well. I have found that they seem to perform better on a good drift or back trolling vs. trolling forward. I've goofed around with just a few beads up to the number seen in the picture. The fish don't seem to care either way PjSorthorn."
5238650,lassh,2016-12-25 06:25:00,553,What is the reason you glue the float onto the hook? Thanks for the pics.
5238666,pjshorthorn,2016-12-25 06:36:00,5654,"The float makes the hook act like a floating jig head. It gives the hook a little bit of buoyancy to keep the bait off the bottom on a slow drift presentation, especially when not using a bottom bouncer. Sometimes I'll pull these with just an egg shaped weight above the barrel swivel and the float keeps the hook from hanging up on the bottom moreso than without a float. PjShorthorn"
5241554,ILScott,2016-12-27 15:12:00,139,"I use fireline that is about 40"" long with 2 beads and then blade and then about 6 beads to the hook. I use to use aberdeen hooks only because if you get snagged up you could straighten the hook out. Is still use them but in the last two years I have switched to the slow death hooks. I was fishing with a buddy and he had them on his spinners and he was catching a lot more than me. I used one of his and we were even then. They give some good action and we use a small chunk of worm on the end and I fish in early June with these and they outperform minnows."
5228826,BornToFish,2016-12-15 06:30:00,1224,"Greetings,I have been using spinner harnesses the past two seasons while fishing in Sunset Country. I've been encouraged with the results to date.I tied my own spinner harnesses, using a variety of sizes/styles of hooks, beads and blades. The number of combinations of these components seems endless.A common feature of all of my spinner harnesses is that I have a hook, a stack of beads and then a single blade. I got to thinking that it might work well to add another stack of beads and another blade. That is, the spinner harnesses could have a hook, a stack of beads, a blade, a second stack of beads and a second blade.Have you tried such an arrangement of beads and blades on your spinner harnesses? If so, how did it work out for you? Is there anything in particular to watch out for?Merry Christmas and a happy and healthy New Year!"
5228850,mrwalleye5,2016-12-15 06:44:00,1922,"Keep it simple. I find the more beads and blades, the less bites. One blade, plastic or metal, a few beads. If using clevis for blade or not, position top bead to offer least blade spinning resistance."
5228898,MrSimon,2016-12-15 07:05:00,922,"I've tried all kinds of combinations over the years and have settled on four beads and one blade. I keep the blades simple ... gold, silver, or red. For beads, I try and make ""fishy"" patterns with yellows, blues, whites, purples, and oranges. Heck, I even have harnesses tied up with no beads or blades at all .... I work them really slow and they are killer on a tight bite."
5229298,Bstar,2016-12-15 11:33:00,564,I agree with the single blade but you may want to tie up some rigs with different size blades like a #5 or 6 Colorado blade. I particularly like the Silver Streak blades made by wolverine tackle.com. Especially like the reverse muffin pattern in a #6 blade on a bouncer.
5229450,Bstar,2016-12-15 14:42:00,564,That's wolverinetackle.com you can also get them at Cabela's.
5229594,adempsey2.0,2016-12-15 18:32:00,612,"Give it a whirl. I've seen guys use harnesses like that, but on big water for suspended walleye."
5229626,Guest,2016-12-15 18:49:00,0,"I like to tie 2 hook 2 blade harnesses. I ve found space the hooks about 10"" apart, one blade in front of each hook, on the back hook I usually put a float with one bead in front of the back hook. Keeps the back hook from snagging the bottom. Also like to use an abriene hook on the back to use minnow and a leech or crawler on front hook. Then I can find out what their hungry for. I have found the 2 blade harness usually work better in spring then late summer ,fall."
5229834,Bobby Winds,2016-12-16 04:07:00,10817,"The amount of beads is determined by the length of the blade. Add beads that all will be covered by the blade but yet comes down to the bottom of the blade or as close as possible. This way when the blade turns it shows the color of the blade and then the contrasting color of the beads as it spins. In Lake Erie I use a #4 Colorado chartreuse blade and 5 orange beads to accomplish this. Haven't used another combination in over 20 years and always do well on Erie. I also have TWO hooks after the blade, not one. But don't tell anyone my secret...................................LOL Bob"
5230010,Babamel2,2016-12-16 07:01:00,414,I have tied a few rigs but have been wondering what type of fishing line you people use when tying your own.
5230050,MrSimon,2016-12-16 07:17:00,922,"I use 20lb floro. It might sound like overkill, but I like it for two reasons ...... it doesn't tangle when I roll them up and put them in little bags, and I very rarely get bite-offs from pike."
