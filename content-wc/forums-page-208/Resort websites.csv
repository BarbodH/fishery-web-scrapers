5168753,Obabikon,2016-10-25 19:17:00,2370,"We are in the process of rebuilding our website. It has been ignored for far too long. I'm wanting something a little more interactive and easily updated. We have that plan in place. My question to you is this... what are you looking for in a resort's website? Most people will be simply looking for information, pricing, pictures, testimonials... all of that basic stuff will be on ours. How can I make it better than ""standard""? Fishing blogs, testimonials, easier ways to upload pictures directly to the site. Videos.... I've got lots of ideas, but I'm looking for outside the box thinkers. Thoughts?"
5169161,DeBo,2016-10-26 05:55:00,211,Have detailed pictures of all of your cabins including the bathrooms. I don't particularly care at all when I am on a trip with the guys but when finding a place to take my wife for a week I do care. Just seems like a simple way to show potential guests what they are getting for their money. Other than that just make it easy to navigate keep it current. I would avoid videos that auto play as that can be very annoying for those searching on slower connections. Links to vids are great though.
5169169,Pooch,2016-10-26 06:07:00,4618,"Several things I appreciate when ""trolling"" through any website is that they load fast. Clicking on cabin pictures, pricing or any change in page then having to wait too long for them to load makes me usually pass over a website. Pretty common and maybe not do-able depending on owners server location.Keeping the website constantly updated is a lot of work and takes imagination, but that keeps people interested and ""checking"" back more often. A weekly fishing report is really nice for incoming guests to prepare for their upcoming trip.If a website is out of date or seldom updated (freshened up might be a better word) then the camp probably will be too. Or at least that has been my experience.Website does not need to be fancy, just interesting enough to hold the viewers interest. Fancy websites are slower and sometimes just ""to much"".Overly glowing guest testimonials don't always carry much weight IMO. Honest pictures of cabins (more than just a front view) are really appreciated. Most guys come to fish, but knowing what they are walking into ahead of time allows us to prepare or pack in.Some camps or cabins are more ""wife friendly"". Not sure how to address that other than pictures of couples and cabin ""facilities"" helps persuade my beloved to go with me.One huge factor is good communications or website response from an inquiring guest. Some camps (Yes, I know it can take be a black hole for time for camp owners) are really slow at getting back when I've inquired about booking dates or cabin availability. Others are great. If I'm torn between two or more camps and wanting to book, the one who responds fairly soon will usually get our booking.One camp we fish gives us thirty days after our trip to re-book the same cabin for the same dates the upcoming year. After that the cabin is up for grabs. I like that. I do not like being under pressure to re-book before leaving camp as we don't always know immediately who can make those dates next year. I know that is not the camp owners problem, but you know as well as anyone that managing a group is like herding cats.Sorry, got off subject. Just keep the website simple, easy to navigate, honest, interesting, relevant, as fast as possible and freshened up several times a year. When you describe your camp, ""talk"" to people about the camp and facilities. Don't just rattle off amenities. If a drive in camp, let new guests know about the surrounding area. Bait shops, grocery stores, etc. in the area or on the way into camp. That really helps planning if we have not been there before.Talking too much., but thanks for asking.Pooch"

5169185,Hot Runr Guy,2016-10-26 06:10:00,16061,"Looking at your current site, I don't see an availability calendar. Many of us, who want to visit a specific resort, can adjust our dates, if we know there's an opening. Of course, it goes without saying that it has to be kept current. Here's an example of a place i stayed at this year: http://www.availabilityonline.com/av...p?un=mogasheen HRG"
5169369,tyeeguy,2016-10-26 07:55:00,111,I agree on the calendar. I always check to see if there are openings around the time I want to go. I can then narrow down my choices and make more targeted phone calls.
5169425,adempsey2.0,2016-10-26 08:27:00,612,"Do NOT over think it. You want it clean, simple and informative (probably responsive too (i.e., mobile friendly)). Definitely no audio or video on front page.Use a current template. There are so many great templates out there that it's so easy to do now. Here are several sites I think use a nice template and fit the description of clean and effective.http://www.bighookcamps.com/http://canoecanada.com/http://clarksresorts.com/http://www.halleyscamps.com/http://www.kabeelo.com/http://kashabowieoutposts.com/http://knobbys.on.ca/http://www.marmaclodge.com/http://www.walleye.ca/http://nakinanorthoutfitters.ca/http://www.oaklakelodge.com/http://www.crowrock.com/http://nestorfalls.com/http://slatefallsoutposts.com/http://whiteriverair.com/https://www.wilderness-air-escapes.com/home/Use UP TO DATE photographs, but don't go overboard. Be smart and use effective and good quality photographs. Ten good ones are better than 100 bad ones [especially dated ones - like on this site]. Don't skip on photo's of cabin interiors, boats and docks. Leave the 1000's of trophy fish photo's for Facebook. Photo's and videos from Drones are really nice.Keep your information UP TO DATE. Always update your rates. However, it's a lot easier to maintain a Facebook site and keep customers informed and up to date that way. You only really need to update your rates on your main site and perhaps change some of the main page eye catching photos every so often.Put detailed information under the appropriate sections. I click on a link for a reason and want information. Present it in a simple and effective way though. Bulleted lists are nice. Things like bedrooms in a cabin, type of water system, how it's powered, type of boats/motors etc.. Detailed and useful travel directions (so many sites do such a bad job of this), lake maps and location of camp/cabin, depth maps, recommended over night accommodations/restaurants.....you know the drill.I would not add a blog, photo gallery, or forum. Use FACEBOOK, YOUTUBE, INSTAGRAM, PHOTOBUCKET. That's why they exist and are so popular. So much easier to maintain. If you do use Facebook, commit to it. That doesn't mean an update every day, but once a week is probably a good idea at minimum. If you want a blog other than Facebook, use a completely separate site with a blogging template and not your main page. Most importantly your site has to make sense and easy to navigate. Here is a perfect example of not doing that.http://wildernessnorth.com/The site looks really nice BUT IS HORRIBLE to use. I hate it so much, lol.Not sure how I feel about a calendar. If it's empty, will I call? If it's full, will I call? Perfect example:So, if Tyeeguy's week was full, would he call? No business wants that. So, ultimately that's a business decision more than a website decision. I'd probably only go that route if it was part of my administration and used it to maintain my bookings and not something standalone just for the website. I wouldn't want the extra work myself.Really think about if you want things like testimonials as well. Sure, they are great, but if you don't keep adding them people will wonder why it's not up to date. Again, that's why Facebook is such a great tool.Good luck!"

I look at outfitter websites every single day and receive feedback from anglers on a broad spectrum of them.By far the most critical aspect of their website that many outfitters overlook is detailed photos inside and out of every cottage as well as the lodge if there is one. Even better, a short video tour of each individual cottage and/or lodge is great! In this day and age everyone does pretty much all of their research online before booking. The more detail you have on your website the better. People want to see exactly what they're booking, no surprises.It's been mentioned by others as well but a booking callender is also a nice feature that few have. It's a great idea with one caveat - if you have NO bookings then you probably don't want to include a booking callender. A really great website is critical these days, but just as important imo is a strong social media presence (Facebook, Twitter, etc...). Along with that online marketing in the form of regular email newsletters are a great idea. All of the outfitters I know who do all of this are hugely successful.If you want a real good example of an outfitter website that does video tours really well have a look at these guys: http://nestorfalls.com/"

No auto play sound or music is something I'm going to add to the list. I understand the appreciation of a calendar with availability, however as the owner, that isn't something that I want. I've ran into different issues with it over the years, and the way we run our business... it is a much larger hindrance than it is help. We have plenty of business, but there are times where I intentionally inform that we have no availability. Sometimes I need to have a slower week to give employees time off, sometimes I have personal things (like family coming) and might not be able to handle a full camp. Anyhow, we greatly encourage people to email or call for availability. I know that puts extra pressure on me to respond quickly, but I'm willing to do that. I know the idea of ""less is more"" is a popular idea, but I'm looking more for interactive blogs, pictures, fishing reports... I'm going to eventually have a competition on who writes the best story/photo wins a _______ I know that many of the people who use our website have no interest in coming to our camp. They simply use it for information. I'm perfectly fine with that, just like I am perfectly fine with giving honest fishing reports to the public. This new website will help create the ""Team Obabikon"" experience. Who we are and what we're about. Like I said in my original post...

I have waited 2-3weeks to get a current pic of a cabin(and have called/emailed several times during that time) and I have waited a couple months for a resort to receive a deposit check and send confirmation(still waiting on that after 3-4mo after they said they would send right out).Thanks for asking"

I would say the better sites have multiple pictures and a floorplan (even is its crudely sketched it helps) List amenities - all - does the cabin have a way to charge electronics is a big one (CPAP machines), what boats including length, what type of engine, do boats have swivel seats) I also agree clean look and easy nav is a must and mobile compatibility - most fishing sites are terrible when viewing from mobile Include a map and description of the lake - if possible mark hot spots - this gives someone looking confidence that they arent starting from scratch Believe someone mentioned it - but this is one of the nice oneshttp://clarksresorts.com/pages/view/cook-lake Cheers Gordy"

If I were operating a camp I would want some flexibility with my cabins to best utilize them. Having my booking calendar for the world to see would complicate and maybe limit me. Example, how do you show a cabin booked or not (on your website) if the group has not sent in deposits? To me that is the owners privileged information. As a guest, I don't need to know everything.In defense of Green's camps. They are undergoing a lot of changes with the passing of the original owners.

Picture after picture of guys holding up stingers of walleye are a turn-off. 20 year old pictures of old guys with 60 walleye laid out on the cleaning table mean I won't be going to that lake.I LOVE to see videos done by guests that document their trip. Obviously you have to get permission to use the video, but if the guest does a good job, you'll have a nice video that shows exactly what a potential guest can expect. I send one of my videos to an outfitter who was THRILLED to put the video on their website ... they even gave me a discount on my next trip."
5249994,Multispecies Guy,2017-01-02 17:16:00,447,Current and accurate photos of inside and outside of cabins including shots of all rooms. Aerial photos as well as close up photos of dock. Everyone bringing their own boat is concerned about protecting that investment and seeing how well-protected the dock area is and how well padded the docks are is very helpful. Easily discernible rates including a prominent statement of whether the rates are Canadian or US. No photos of stringers of fish. Or dead muskies. I enjoy photos of scenery and wildlife (tells me that it's not just about fishing for the owners) Mention the terrain from cabins to dock. Flat? Steep? Distance? A weekly fishing report would be great. Not website specific but be prompt in answering any correspondence. The digital world has made us all expect timely feedback to questions.
5250002,MrSimon,2017-01-02 17:25:00,922,"One thing that this thread reminded me ..... regardless of the website, you should always CALL the lodge and ask your questions .... and get a reference from someone you trust.

5197473,BornToFish,2016-11-16 13:18:00,1224,"Greetings,The last few post on this thread are of interest to me.I fish at a particular lodge in NW Ontario that sends a multi-page document to each guest upon booking. The document contains all sorts of helpful information - tips for crossing the border, things to bring and fishing suggestions. The fishing suggestions covers all the species of fish, equipment, techniques and seasonal movements. I've wondered many times if the guests even bother to read the fishing suggestions. If they do, they must use the ""it's close"" approximation to fishing. The power of my walleye rod is ""close"" to what is recommended. The diameter (weight) of my fishing line is ""close"" to that recommended. The weight of my jigs are ""close"" to that recommended, and so on. Pretty soon, all of the ""closes"" add up to being ""close"" to catching fish!I have long served as a reference for the fishing lodge that I fish from. I exchange emails and take phone calls from many prospective guests. I talk them through proven fishing techniques on the lake at the time of the year that they will be at the lodge. Many people have told me that my comments were very helpful. I close these discussions with two main points. First, they will probably struggle during their vacation on lakes within the Canada Shield if they fish the same way that they do on their home waters in the USA. Second, their vacation is their investment of time and money. It's up to them to decide as to how they want to fish.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5197489,tv4fish,2016-11-16 13:38:00,2694,"My point exactly - There ARE some big differences -- you are helping them to have a ""better fishing trip"" - good on ya'."
5197497,Bakefish,2016-11-16 13:43:00,1077,"I have to agree with Mike. Lure selection can change from year to year on the same lake in the same week. One year we slammed walleye on gold jigs, next year, same week, orange. Couldn't get them to touch gold. One year pike were hammering lipless cranks, next year, same week, forget about it. The first year I fished my current lake I killed the pike on chatterbaits. I swear I've caught no more than 3 or 4 since."

Light and medium light action rods, 4 and 6 lb line, 1/8 and 1/16 jigs were recommended. This was considerably lighter than the equipment I had originally planned on using. I strongly feel that type of local intel made what would have been an average trip to an epic experience."

Up to date photos of the boats and motors are a must. Same with the cabins - multiple photos on the inside of the cabins clearly showing what kitchen appliances are included. Finally, the web site should list what is included in each plan, what is not permitted in camp, and suggestions as to what to bring with you on the trip.

5193922,kayakmatt,2016-11-12 21:10:00,105,"Most websites fail to address these issues... My wife and I often go with my friends. I want to know if there are separate bedrooms, with doors. She doesnt want to listen to my buddies snore all night if we get stuck in a one room cabin, and would like some privacy when we sleep. She always asks if we have to sleep in bunk beds also. Heck I don't know, let me call the lodge again. I always want to know which cabin we are staying in. Usually we have no idea. Go ahead and state the minimum party size for each cabin. Are the cabins connected...those can be noisy with the wrong neighbor, Some ""American Plan"" cabins have a dorm room size fridge. I really want that fridge that will hold some beers and sodas, but when I question the size of the fridge, I've gotten some interesting responses. Sorry I had to ask. Actually, I always ask for the housekeeping cabins, even if I am on American Plan, as I like a full kitchen. I've been to places where I brought a bottle of wine into dinner, and was told I couldn't have it, cause they were a licensed bar. I often have had to email the camp just to find out if the boats have a trolling motor, and had to specifically state Electric Trolling motor. On the front or back? Looked at a website recently, looks like you can't go out fishing after dinner, but it doesn't really say. That would eliminate that place immediately! Anyway, website should explain details and price. I like this explanation on pricing...""Everything Included in price"" No surprises."

It's fairly common practice, but to me it's needless fluff. There's maybe 2% of your potential clientele who might be interested in fishing tips. No offense to anyone. As mentioned before clearly show the inside and out of all of the facilities with up to date photos or videos. All the cabins, the lodge, boats/motors, etc. People want to know EXACTLY what they're booking.Agreed that testimonials posted on the site add little value, but a list of names and contact info for past guests is a great idea.

As some of the other guys have pointed out - it may well be VERY helpful to ""new"" customers who have no idea of what they should bring to be a successful fisherman at a particular lodge.I can tell you this - the way we fish and the tackle that we use down here in Minnesota is not the same way that we fish on Lac Seul. I think for any neophytes going to a lodge for the first time - that would indeed be very helpful information and help prevent someone bringing a ton of equipment that would be unused."

5175369,Guest,2016-10-29 22:32:00,0,"I really don't need a photo of a fish. Your walleye looks just like the next walleye. Don't need any pictures of sunsets either But good photos of the cabin, entrance, porch, stairs, interior, are a must. One good photo of the cleaning house Stable docks are important. Height above water is important. Its also really nice if the boat doesn't slide under the dock. Stopped going to the last resort, in part, because the floating docks were 29"" above the water, making it very difficult to board the boat, even harder to get out. And even my 19' boat would slide under the dock. Other important items: screens on windows, and something to string a line on to hang wet clothes. You all know how stupid it is to drape your wet things over and above the heater, but we will do it if there is no other place to dry our gear."
5176833,Shorelunch,2016-10-31 07:17:00,554,"1) Quality photos of resort, including cabins, docks, dining, and other amenities 2) Short videos (YouTube) of each cabin and amenities 3) A welcome video showing what type of experience you can expect when you visit 4) Typical seasonal fishing patterns 5) Video testimonials from ""real"" fishermen 6) I would read an updated blog - especially if updated more than weekly about fishing successes, failures, events around the resort and funny stories."
5176849,That Minnesota guy,2016-10-31 07:32:00,8293,"I view testimonials like I would product reviews on the web. I always assume some are paid and salted in with good reviews. Any filmed testimonial I would view as suspect because.............who gives a terrible review with a camera stuck in your face with the owner behind it? Even if you do, why would it make it onto the web site?""Hi, we stayed at Joe Smoe's last week and the mice & mosquito's in the cabin drove us crazy! Our only sanctuary was out on the water. We were able to get the leak in the boat fixed temporarily but couldn't keep the motor running for over 10 minutes at a time. Good thing was if we let it sit 5 minutes it started right up!"""
5176873,rzep,2016-10-31 08:06:00,1196,"Owners control content of their website so the testimonials are really self serving and lock credibility.I pay attention to yelp, trip advisor and others . So it is really in the hands of customers to use 3rd party review resources. If I was an owner, I would not have testimonial section...."
5178937,BornToFish,2016-11-01 08:13:00,1224,"Greetings,I thought of a few suggestions relative to updating websites. One such suggestion is to include pictures of the docks. Are there plug-ins for recharging batteries? Is there a dock hand available to assist guests? Are boats tied up to a dock cleat or is the bow of the boat engaged into a V? Is there a boat launch on site? Will handi-capped individuals have difficulty getting into or out of the boat?Another suggestion is to include pictures of the boats. A picture can be worth a thousand words. Many anglers will want to know this information as they spend a lot of their waking time in the boat. The pictures will convey information about how the boat is configured and equipped, both in terms of comforts (e.g. the types of seats) and necessary equipment (anchors, nets, depth finders, etc.).A clear listing of services/items provided (e.g. towels, linens, coffee filters, dish soap, etc.) versus items not provided (e.g. life vests or fish cleaning/freezing) is always helpful in avoiding mis-understandings that can cause a vacation to start off on the wrong foot.Yet another suggestion is to clearly state the lodge's refund policy. Having this information readily accessible to the guests, rather than buried in the fine print, will reduce the likelihood of a bad experience and hard feelings.It's always helpful for potential guests to know about the availability of live bait and guides at a fishing lodge. Will guests need to stop on the way to the lodge for their own live bait? Are fishing guides available, and if so, what are their experience level? For example, have the guides been guiding on the lake(s) for many decades or are they only there to drive the boat?Some guests would also want to know about other options that might be available that could enhance the experience of staying at a lodge. For example, does the lodge have a swimming beach or an area where children can throw a football? Does the lodge organize a weekly pot-luck meal, fish fry or a bonfire? These activities can reduce anxiety of being the ""new people"" at the lodge and will they will be welcomed into the lodge? Does the lodge have access to remote boat-cache lakes for day trips? I know that many folks search for a fishing lodge that is friendly to families and women. Any information on a website that speaks to this concept should be prominently displayed if the lodge owner is targeting this segment of the market. Are there store(s) nearby that can be a source for items that may have been left at home?I agree with previous posts that the internet is a major factor in guests determining where/how they will spend their vacations. Trade shows during the off-season seem to be less popular than they were in the past, as a way to obtain information about fishing lodges. This leads me to a personal dilemma, as I am old-fashioned in that I want to be able to look into the lodge owner's eyes and shake his hand. I'm not sure how this feeling can be conveyed through the internet. I guess you will continue seeing me at the All Canada Shows.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5180009,eyemike,2016-11-01 18:21:00,233,Two examples of good websites That I personally really like (stayed at both resorts). Stanley's Resort and Booi's Trout Lake Lodge. Both are full of information. I bookmarked these sites and would go back and plan my trip during the cold winter nights.
5181689,Guest,2016-11-02 10:13:00,0,I would like good picture of the boats you have.
5188969,NP4ME,2016-11-07 10:23:00,378,"For me, and my group, it's mostly about equipment. Boats, motors, trolling motors, etc. Good pictures and descriptions of those. Pictures of the cabins (inside and out) are also a plus. Our group is an American plan group, so we look for pictures of the lodge, along with pictures of meals that are served."
5189073,1K1MOA,2016-11-07 11:22:00,90,"A breakdown of fishing tactics for spring, summer and fall by fish species would be greatly appreciated. That would help in selecting the right type of equipment (rods, line #, lures, etc.) to bring. I always bring way more than I need to a new lake. Specific info on the lakes fishery and conditions encountered would help me reduce my tackle box and maybe even a rod or two would be left home. This info would also be helpful in selecting the place you want to go that matches the type of fishing you like to do."
5189537,Obabikon,2016-11-07 17:00:00,2370,Awesome idea.
5170137,adempsey2.0,2016-10-26 14:38:00,612,"I wasn't really trying to say anything negative about Green's Camps at all. Their site is actually pretty good, but the photos are not great. I just don't understand all that effort for a new site but using old photos. There are far worse ones out there. It's just a comment on the website, not their operation."
5170153,Obabikon,2016-10-26 14:39:00,2370,"The other thing that I do is if a group of 5 requests a cabin that sleeps 8... I tell them they can have it as long as I don't get a larger group that can book. So, while it might be marked as ""occupied"", for a group of 8... I am willing (and have agreed) to move the group of 5 to a smaller cabin. There's a ton of issues involved in it. While it is nice to look at, I PERSONALLY think it would cause more problems than benefits (in our situation)."
5170169,rzep,2016-10-26 14:45:00,1196,Color coded. Red - no deposit ... black deposit taken ... have seen this on few websites ...

5170826,Crackback,2016-10-27 01:39:00,257,"Being mobility disabled with a neurological condition affecting my legs and balance, I always look for a description, information or photos on how mobility accessible is the cabin and facilities to where I have to moor my boat and how far is the walking distance and how many stairs steps I have to climb. I look for handrails on all the stair steps and I look to see how secure the dock is. A rolling, moving , floating dock is a killer for folks who have balance and walking problems. I also look for where the electric plug is to plug in my Amigo Travel Mate scooter at the cabin. The place we went to on Lac Seul, White Wings, will furnish me a golf cart next year at no charge so I don't have to bring my Amigo which can't get me near the dock because its small tires sink in the sand. Canadian outfitters are missing business because they neglect to do some simple easy to correct things to accommodate the mobility handicapped angler. You would be surprised the good fish camps and lodges I skipped over because of stairs without handrails moving docks and poor ramps because of mobility accessibility issues. A big help would be to have a vertical hand post/pipe mounted on the dock so a mobility afflicted person would have something to grab on to while he is getting in or out of the boat. With falling water levels, getting in and out of a boat docked lengthwise along a dock is really tough when you don't have a fixed post attached to the dock to grab on too to get you from the dock to the boat or boat to the dock. Once again a very easy fix to allow handicapped accessibility and advertised as such to get more client business. Another thing us disabled people need is ADA tall toilets, these 14 inch ground hugging commodes make it tough to get back up as compared the taller 17- 18 inch ones. Little things add up to big dollars when I look for places to fish. Unless you have walking and balance issues, you will never understand what people of my ilk are going through when you try to launch a boat, and stay at a camp or lodge without care and foresight given to mobility accessibility as it is so simple to correct. The simple things of just having a single wooden bar stool to sit on in the cabin as you cook in front of the stove or wash dishes frees up a hand you would ordinarily use to hold on to something to steady your balance. A simple wall mounted hand rail sold at Home Depot in the shower stall and shower area makes it easy to shower and not fall while not otherwise holding on the shower head or the shower curtain rod. Simple things......try going through life with one hand tied behind your back and see how you function. wink...."
5171018,wallydave,2016-10-27 06:45:00,2151,Hidden Bay Lodge went out of their way in working with our group to make the trip with an above the knee amputation concern with one of our group. Shaggy worked with us to find the lake/cabin with the least number of steps! And now back to our regularly scheduled programming.
5171809,bthomas3333,2016-10-27 13:40:00,465,I don't think anyone has mentioned a decent listing of recommended tackle. I used to be the guy who would drag in +50# of 'stuff in 12 370 boxes'. As I have aged I decided to go lighter. Now I repack one backpack for each trip I take. It would be nice to have a list of bait / tackle including recommended sizes. To really blow it out show some pictures of recommend tackle. My two cents... B-
5173193,Moosebunk,2016-10-28 12:16:00,211,"1. Rates & dates, guided/non-guided. 2. Pictures of fish, please hold off on the full E.A.P. angler shots to just the 0-75% range. 100% and it's considered trying too hard. 3. Accommodations. A few pics are fine. If still interested after 1 & 2, will call or email to talk more about 3, 4, 5, 6... and so on."

5170121,adempsey2.0,2016-10-26 14:35:00,612,"I am just thinking from the perspective of a business owner. There are plenty of potential problems with booking schedules. They constantly change, so if your online booking system is not up to date, both parties can lose out. Also, there are definitely going to be times where a week is tentatively booked but the party not yet committed. So, what do you do in that situation? It might help the outfitter to know you're interested so they can confirm with the other party. If it was blocked off, you may not have called. Not to mention last minute cancellations and perhaps even referrals.No business would want a potential customer to not call them. That makes no sense. However, the business should do a cost benefit analysis to determine if there are net gains or not.My point was that something as simple as a calendar system may seem like a trivial and positive thing to have, but I can also see a lot of negatives for a business to post that publicly. Just a consideration is all. Think about business that don't post rates. Most post them, but there are still some that don't because they think it hurts their business. Meanwhile, a potential customer may just find that annoying - or maybe they'll end up with a great deal."
5170129,Camoclad,2016-10-26 14:36:00,628,"This is a great thread, awesome of you to ask for suggestions! I am with WallyDave on the webcam idea, there are a few out there and they are fun to watch when you are toiling away at your desk! Another piece of information on the website that I think would be helpful is a solid set of ""how to get here"" directions for folks that travel a long way. Maybe some landmark items to reference. Another is access to some fishing maps for folks to look over and research about the lake while they are waiting for the trip to get there. Last, if you are attending any sport shows you could indicate that on the website and your inquisitive potential guests may come see you to ask questions and past guests might plan to come say hi and thanks for a great time on previous trips. Wouldn't hurt my feeling about a lodge if none of these are on the website, but I feel like some folks might appreciate them. Good luck with the redesign. For sure the website is a make a good first impression tool."
5169497,LOW1,2016-10-26 08:46:00,2828,"First, a complete, accurate and easy to understand explanation of what you charge and what the customer will get for their $.Second, accurate pictures. Put your best foot forward but then make sure you live up to these standards.Third, if you want regular visitors to your site use a webcam and/or regular fishing reports that are updated very frequently. (But I don't know how many of the visitors to your site to see these features will turn into actual customers)Above all, updates are necessary. A bad site with accurate current information is probably better than a spiffy new site with bad or stale information."
5169505,Lazy Fisherman,2016-10-26 08:46:00,276,"I agree with one of the previous posts, if possible, have an availability calendar."
