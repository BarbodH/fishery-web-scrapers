5237930,Shellback,2016-12-24 06:17:00,8083,"But those Canadian lodge owners charging in US $ have much higher costs than an owner charging in CA $. I read that on the internet, so it must be true."
5237994,pjshorthorn,2016-12-24 07:17:00,5654,"Actually, there are quite a few establishments in Mexico owned by Canadian citizens. I've frequented a "" few"" bars owned by Canadians which were all great places. The confusing part came into play when they charged you in pesos for a beer and you got change back in loonies. Being that I was an American in Mexico , drinking at a Canadian bar, I just went with it thinking that I would use all the loonies for the next fishing trip north of the border. On the way home, I was stopped in customs as they noticed quite a large amount of Canadian currency in my backpack when pulled for a personal screening. It was a long conversation , to say the least, as the agents couldn't follow how I acquired all the loonies in Mexico as part of the exchange rate during my trip. PjShorthorn"
5238050,v-bay gord,2016-12-24 07:54:00,3168,"True, and I also read on WC that many guests don't mind paying a higher rate because the resort owners are good guys and deserve to make as much money as possible. ..."
5238074,Obabikon,2016-12-24 08:18:00,2370,"This is so incredibly stupid, but I can't stand the pointless idiotic baiting. Just because someone charges in one currency over the other... does not mean they are more expensive or less expensive. It also does not mean they are more or less profitable."
5238218,rzep,2016-12-24 09:55:00,1196,If looney is at 0.6 I think I will use Uber to get to the Red Lake...
5238242,rickn,2016-12-24 10:14:00,993,"I haven't been able to get to Canada for 4 yrs, due to logistics at home, but the resort where I went posted rates in usd, and preffered a personal check vs cc.worked for me. Now I have to start looking for a new place, that one was sold to a private individual who closed the camp.going to miss that place. Good memories."
5238250,v-bay gord,2016-12-24 10:20:00,3168,"It's all in good fun Obabikon. After years of flogging this issue I now realize that nobody cares....or worse, understands."
5237170,Andre (wallyandre),2016-12-23 10:16:00,2274,I don't want to see that at .65 so after the bank it's going to be .62. I fish in the states for 4 months in the summer!
5237178,fishn-rod,2016-12-23 10:21:00,19,"Hmmmm, any Canadian resorts that charge in Pesos ?"
5237234,fishn-rod,2016-12-23 10:55:00,19,"Lets not forget about Halls cough drops, and Dare Maple Leaf Cr√®me Cookies."
5237250,Pooch,2016-12-23 11:41:00,4618,If so... I'm in.Pooch
5237426,Obabikon,2016-12-23 15:00:00,2370,"Yay... I've missed this SOOOOO much. LOL Who cares what they charge in? If I charge 25,000 pesos to come to my resort, is it cheaper than me charging $800 USD's? (that's about 16,000 pesos) Just do the exchange rate before you book, and figure out if it is a good price or not. What they charge in does not make it a good deal or bad deal. What YOU actually pay and the service you receive is what determines the ""deal""."
5237442,Obabikon,2016-12-23 15:10:00,2370,"To follow up that... Obabikon will give quotes and accept payment in Pesos, Yen, Canadian, and even Euro. We also will accept physical silver, gold, stocks, CD's and any other legitimate form of payment you would like to make. I can also be convinced to barter, but it is tricky to declare actual values of goods. We will need to do the proper import documents and declare the hst on the value of the transaction. Anyone want to buy me a brand new ranger for a trip? You can purchase that in Canadian if you'd like! I can assure all of you, the easiest and most cost efficient way to pay for a trip to my resort (for everyone involved) is to pay in YOUR original currency. Since US guests are 99.9% of my business, that's what we list prices in. But, we do not discriminate, and will accept/quote in all legal currency. It really doesn't matter what you pay with, as long as it is the value that I want to receive for a trip."
5237578,fishn-rod,2016-12-23 17:13:00,19,"Hmmmm, any Canadian resorts that charge in Pesos ? That was exactly my point. A few year ago my trip was about #1000 US. Switch to a different resort and lake. Better fishing, nicer owners, nicer cabins and facilities overall, and no 4x4 needed. Price at new resort is $600 all in, CANADIAN. If he switched to US dollars, I would still be there. If he bumped the price up to $1000 US, I would still be there."
5237586,rzep,2016-12-23 17:25:00,1196,"If I want nice facilities and service followed with value, I will go to Four Seasons week after new year. When I go fishing to CAN , I don't mind using outhouse for the time being... .."
5237594,Obabikon,2016-12-23 17:26:00,2370,"You did a great job, and found a great deal. Not only was it cheaper, it was better. That is a win. A cheaper trip is a cheaper trip... no matter what currency they charge in."
5237738,fishn-rod,2016-12-23 19:30:00,19,"Maybe. Not sure how it would compare to the popular places on WC. Never been to LOW or Las Suel. All I know is it is better than the last place. Someday, when I have more time, and friends with more money, I would like to explore and experience more areas. Dad was able to retire at 50, and enjoy many wonderful lakes and resorts in NW ontario for 30 years. Most years he spent 4-6 weeks up there."
5235977,pjshorthorn,2016-12-22 08:15:00,5654,"What outfits are you looking at ? Fishing charters ? If so, there would be no surprise that they charge in US. Quite a few are Americans. What's your point ? PjShorthorn."
5235985,LOW1,2016-12-22 08:19:00,2828,"I think the difference between the buy rate and the sell rate for US$ will result in there being no or miniscule savings to you. Maybe if you opened up a Cnd$ bank account you could justify doing this, but then you have minimum deposit balances to consider, etc. Deposit American dollars and they may give a better exchange rate than the rate they charge noncustomers.As others have said, a cc would be much more convenient."
5235993,rzep,2016-12-22 08:19:00,1196,Yes...if they charge in US $...exchange rate does not matter..does it?
5236089,v-bay gord,2016-12-22 09:19:00,3168,"It seems most places I've looked at in Mexico charge in U.S. $ probably for the same reason most lodges in NW Ontario do......they make money from the currency exchange. Would be nice to pay in pesos, with the great exchange."
5236137,andersaki,2016-12-22 10:06:00,1426,"One way or another you're going to pay an exchange fee. It's a cost of doing business. Jesus didn't like it either, he tipped over the money changers tables in the temple. andersaki"
5236185,rzep,2016-12-22 10:28:00,1196,Still... $250 for 7 hour charter going after sailfish or rooster is a great deal anytime. ...I am now around Naples this week and fishing really sucks...
5236545,pjshorthorn,2016-12-22 16:13:00,5654,"Depends on if you can negotiate with the charter captain to pay him in pesos. We had a local captain that we had been using for years and paid in pesos. We paid him to release every billfish we caught as well, otherwise the fish would have ended up at the local market. We tipped very well over the course of three full days of fishing so he made out quite well. Hotels and restaurants charged in pesos. If one knows what to do you can pay the entire trip in pesos and save a few sheckles for the next trip. PjShorthorn."
5237114,Andre (wallyandre),2016-12-23 09:18:00,2274,I was reading some forecast for the Can$ this morning and it all forecast for a dollar at 70-71cents. and that should be around May.
5237138,v-bay gord,2016-12-23 09:53:00,3168,.....or even better. http://www.msn.com/en-ca/money/topst...cid=spartanntp Let the exchange rate debate begin! (I'm sure those who charge in U.S. will factor in this potential windfall when they set their rates....)
5237162,LOW1,2016-12-23 10:14:00,2828,"Great time to be an exporter of essential Canadian products. You know, curling brooms, flashing green stoplights to replace left turn green arrows, and third rate pro football players. That about covers it."
5235506,Pooch,2016-12-21 18:03:00,4618,"I usually use our MC for most purchasers in Canada and Mexico, but after watching the exchange rate while in Mexico using Peso's vs Master Card vs US dollars I found the best deal in Peso's. I believe the same is true for Canada purchases. Plastic is handy, but they still charge you a tiny percentage for the convenience. Maybe not enough to worry about, but...This year before leaving for Mexico I converted our anticipated needs from USD into Mexican Peso's. I think I'm going to do the same thing for Canadian dollars in anticipation of next years trips. Right now the CND dollar is about .74 vs the USD. That is a good place to convert. It has remained stable only varying a penny either way for a while. Wasn't that long ago the CND and USD were pare.Just hedging my bets.Anyone else think about stuff like this?Pooch"
5235562,v-bay gord,2016-12-21 18:36:00,3168,If you're not thinking about exchange rates then you are really missing the boat.
5235570,martinbns,2016-12-21 18:37:00,1520,"It's a bit of a suckers game trying to time exhcange rates. We flip whatever CDN equals $50 US into a US$ account every two weeks to even it out. There were articles up here forecasting both .79 and .65 Cdn dollars in the same week in alternate papers. Generally, Fed rates are rising and Bank of Canada will either stay flat or go down, will result in higher US dollar and lower Cdn. the exchange rate is usually somewhere around 2.5% in either direction off actual when buying or selling including Mastercard or Visa. If you think your trip costs $2,000 its $50 in either direction."
5235602,rzep,2016-12-21 19:06:00,1196,Find CC which does not charge exchange fees. I use Southwest CC visa issued by chasel. You also get miles ...They had a deal of 50k free miles if signed up which is essentially round trip for 2 from IL to FL. The drawback is $99 annual fee.
5235681,elway12,2016-12-21 21:50:00,335,"I too think of those things Pooch! But as rzep said, find a cc with a low exchange rate fee. My MC only charges me 1%. Plus I get the 1% cash back or more for purchases and a higher % cash back for gas and groceries. I had looked this past year on converting the money(cash) as you speak of but banks here in AZ and even the place here at the airport get some huge fees(beyond the exchange rate) in converting your money."
5235841,Shellback,2016-12-22 06:29:00,8083,"I have a Capital One card, and there are no foreign fees. Get the actual exchange rate on the day of purchase. Swapping money at a bank, they usually charge an exchange fee, maybe up to 5 %. I use my card for most purchases in Canada. For cash, I have a Canadian friend I swap money with. I get the Canadian cash with no fee, and he gets the US money with no fee."
5235857,pjshorthorn,2016-12-22 06:38:00,5654,"If I need to charge anything in a foreign country I use my Amex card. No fees and the exchange rate applied is current with what is offered on the open market. The annual fee for the card is not much different than any other cards offered by lenders. I take exchange rates into consideration as part of the decision making process on where we might want to stay in Canada just like I did when fishing for sailfish and Marlin out of Zihuatenejo ,MX. Mexico is back on my radar screen as the exchange rate has nearly doubled since my last visit. PjShorthorn"
5235897,Pooch,2016-12-22 07:20:00,4618,"Our first trip to Mexico we stayed in the old Zia'. Walked to town for bread and supplies every couple days. Was still a sleepy little town, but we could see change coming. The mid town tent market was a thing to experience! Oh my...Pooch"
5235953,pjshorthorn,2016-12-22 07:59:00,5654,You are right about a sleepy little town. We would stay at Hotel Imelda and walk to the harbor every morning to get on our charter. The local fishermen would just be coming in with their catch from the night and getting it ready for sale. It was the panga fleet at its best. We would have great dinners at the small cantinas sitting on the sidewalk across from the harbor while everyone walked by.....with young kids hawking their merchandise and Chiclets. Never had a concern about walking around town at night back in those days. Hopefully I'll get back there one day to relive some old memories with good fishing buddies. PjShorthorn
5235961,rzep,2016-12-22 08:04:00,1196,Uhmm...looking at 3-4 outfits in Zia..all in U.S. currency. .
