I am planning to purchase a garmin handheld Oregon 600 and wondered if anyone has been to the area and used the chip.I would be using the unit primarily for navigation but heard this was also in 1' increments which would be even better. I am also aware none of the units are bullet proof, especially on Shoal lake.Thanks in advance"
5232354,Shellback,2016-12-18 12:27:00,8083,"I don't think Navionics mapping is compatible with Garmin units. Pray tell, where is shoal ash rapids? I may be able to see if it's on my Garmin chip if it's in Ontario."
5232618,Stringbean,2016-12-18 19:13:00,279,Shoal Lake is west of the upper part of Lake of the Woods right along the Manitoba border.
5232650,martinbns,2016-12-18 20:29:00,1520,Ash Rapids is the access route from the Main part of LOTW to Shoal Lake.
5232954,Shellback,2016-12-19 08:27:00,8083,"I'm not coming up with anything on my Garmin chip, it's a few years old now. If you go to http://webapp.navionics.com/ you will see what Navionics offers. Beware that Navionics is not compatible with Garmin though. I can run Navionics in my Delorme handheld GPS."
5235849,deadhead1,2016-12-22 06:35:00,193,My understanding is that once you get out into the bigger part of Shoal Lake there will be no detailed mapping available on any device or chip.
5240586,chris165,2016-12-26 19:03:00,128,Anglers Edge Mapping is the only available product that I know of available to the pubilc that has digital charts of Shoal. I don't think they have it completely charted yet though. Compatible with Lowrance units only. http://www.anglersedgemapping.com/about.html
5243442,Ia Walihntr,2016-12-29 07:37:00,320,I have a Navionics + chip (for my Humminbird) that shows LOTW Shoal Lake but once you get just past Shoal Lake narrows and into Shoal Lake the depth contours disappear!
5246258,robm_mb,2016-12-30 23:06:00,48,"Thanks for the plug Chris! You're correct that our charting of Shoal is not complete; we've started at the north end of the lake and will continue chipping away at new water year after year. For spring 2017 we will release Indian Bay, this will be in addition to the stretch we currently offer from (and including) Clytie & Bag bays over to the mouth of Indian Bay including the area north of Cash Island. Our maps are Lowrance exclusive and can be purchased from our web store as well as a couple of local Manitoba retailers (The Fishin Hole, Pro Am Tackle, Faloma Beach Marina). Also, once Navico's Gofree shop (www.gofreeshop.com) is up and running again in full capacity, individual lake maps will again be downloadable for those who are only interested in a single lake vs multiple bodies as featured on our region-specific chips. This is the most economical option for anybody visiting from afar who won't be fishing any of the other lakes on one of our chips. I've attached a preview of our 2016 Shoal mapped content, will post a preview of the 2017 mapped content once we're able to generate it. Shoal is an incredible fishery! -Rob McDougall Angler's Edge Mapping"
