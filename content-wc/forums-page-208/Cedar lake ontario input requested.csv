Nice people, and willing to help with whatever you need. It is not a fancy camp, so I wouldn't recommend it for someone looking for first rate accomodations, but it is plenty comfortable for our group. Good location on the lake. It's the only lodge on East Cedar, and there are no private cabins on that side of the lake, so it is more remote. However, we have noticed more and more boat traffic the last five years or so, and a good deal of competition on many of the muskie spots."
5227034,Plotman,2016-12-13 13:51:00,394,"I am torn between Cedar Lake and Lac Seul. We have never been to either but, I hate the thought of driving 13 hours to have boats ""crowd"" in on you heck, I get plenty of that here in Iowa! We aren't looking for fancy, just peaceful with a good chance of catching various species if the effort is put forth. I need to make a decision soon as openings are filling up fast."
5227138,wallydave,2016-12-13 14:51:00,2151,"Timing is everything, early season on the NW section of Lac Seul can get crowded! The traffic is one reason I have been going later in the season, plus the weather can be a concern in the early months. I have always wanted to try Cedar lake, but my problem is putting a trip together. As noted getting an open cabin in the spring can be a problem! Happy hunting!"
5228722,Plotman,2016-12-15 05:56:00,394,"We are booked at Keystone and due to scheduling the only time frame that would work was July 15-22. Maybe not the ideal time but, this is a family vacation and I am looking forward to it. Any suggestions from those that have been on cedar at that time regarding depth,presentations or locations? Thanks to all those that posted here and P.m,s"
5229642,pale ryder,2016-12-15 19:04:00,1937,"I've fished Cedar 8 times in July and August.There will be walleyes just about everywhere.Weeds, points, reefs and flats. And we caught them trolling crank baits, rigging, jigging, and casting. Some years everything works and some years they are picky. Last year we did best on Lindy rigs with Gum drop floats and minnows or leaches on rocks in 12' of water. Some years weeds were best. Jigs and plastic in the weed pockets and minnow or leaches on the weed edges. Other years reefs were better. And every year we get some fish trolling cranks.On new lakes I start out trolling. Looking for fish and interesting spots. Then I go back and fish the interesting spots jigging, rigging and casting.And you shouldn't have to fish deeper than 15' or so.For smallies the same areas only shallower.For musky weeds and rock, mostly weeds."
5229962,The tank,2016-12-16 06:50:00,340,I fish alot in canada and I love July to mid august. My best week on cedar came on third week of July. On Tuesday of that week I caught 102 walleyes and 28 smallmouth and for the week I caught over 80 smallmouth and over 460 walleyes. With cedar don't be afraid of fishing shallow and slow. I fish out of cedar point resort and fish mainly Neilson lake to the east side also bass fish up to Perreault lake. I watched some others in camp that were complainin about the fishing and they was pulling spinners and way to fast. We fished all rocks and reefs and some weeds. I used nothing but whistler jigs with a worm or minnow no plastics. If the winds blowing into the weeds it can be stupid good there.
5232818,prov1800,2016-12-19 06:28:00,5010,If you plan on staying at cedar lake lodge i would pick a bit later in june or through july for walleye.west end takes a while to get going it seems.east end has faster action earlier in the season.iam not saying there are no fish in west end at that time of year just slower fishing as they bite more toward evening.water is clearer and deeper.weed beds do come alive toward dark.but good pike and smallmouth fishing in that section.keystone is on the east end a requires a fair drive outvto the highway.where from cedar lake lidge you are very closecto mainland launch.probably faster if you wanted to get out.have you contacted cedar point resort about pets.
5232874,Plotman,2016-12-19 07:24:00,394,"Yeah, I checked with Cedar Point Resort which was actually my first choice and NO pets so, we booked July 15-22 with Keystone which was the only period we could make work. My new boat is rigged with Humminbird and I just looked over the Navionics map I downloaded onto the SD card and it basically just shows the lake outline and very few rocks and I think 1 island. Does anyone know of a mapping card with more detail that works in Humminbird for this lake?"
5232882,prov1800,2016-12-19 07:34:00,5010,I use the canada map from navionics.iam sure there is one for a hummingbird.mine is for a lowrance.cedar is fairly detailed on it.
5236473,Guest,2016-12-22 15:03:00,0,"You will be at Keystone the week before us. We always go late July. We target muskies in the morning and evening and only fish walleyes during the middle of the day. As already stated, they can be pretty scattered at that time. Dougie at Keystone is willing to give you specific spots, just ask him."
5212194,Plotman,2016-11-30 18:42:00,394,"My family and I are looking for that 1 place that we can return to year after year as our annual fishing vacation destination. So far we have not found that place and now are considering Cedar Lake Lodge on Cedar Lake as they allow dogs. Any input on this Lodge or location on the lake? Best time of year for this area when primarily targeting walleyes while also seeking smallmouth,crappie and pike? Any input appreciated."
5212298,Rich B,2016-11-30 20:06:00,1081,Sent you a PM....
5213722,pale ryder,2016-12-01 17:00:00,1937,"I've been been to Cedar about 10 times so far. I always stay at Clark's Northern Lights. They run a great camp. I don't know about their pet policy.Cedar is just what I look for in a lake.Big enough that I never get bored, but not so big that wind is a problem.Walleyes, SMB, BIG muskies, crappies. and some pike.I consider the fishing very good, but it is not so easy that there isn't any challenge."
5213834,Plotman,2016-12-01 18:23:00,394,"I checked clarks and they dont allow pets which seems quite common. How crowded is the lake in June,early July? How is it in regards to navigating underwater hazards in the event a long run is needed to find active fish?"
5217234,pale ryder,2016-12-04 14:42:00,1937,"Cedar is fairly easy to navigate. There is 1 marked rock hazard that is easy to avoid. You shouldn't have to run very far to catch fish, they are everywhere. But I usually run to the other end a couple of times each trip just to try something different. I've never felt crowded. You will see other boats but it's easy to find a place to fish. I've caught walleyes there in quite shallow water to about 25' on crank baits jigs and rigs. On rocks, weeds and flats. Some times they are everywhere. Some times they on specific kinds of spots."
5219802,Plotman,2016-12-06 18:20:00,394,I am liking what I am hearing/reading about this lake. Any input on Keystone Lodge as my wife is not real keen on being isolated on an island (Cedar Lake Lodge) and likes being able to drive to town while me and our son do the father/son fishing thing. Its down to Cedar or Lake of the Woods U.S side but a bit concerned about crowds therefore considering Arnesens there.
5219994,DavKin,2016-12-07 06:53:00,104,"Plotman, I have not stayed Cedar Lake Camp but I can vouch for Darren Bochler, owner with his wife, Merri. I did not see any mention of pets at www.cedarlakecamp.com."
5220034,Plotman,2016-12-07 07:26:00,394,"I already checked with Cedar Lake Camp as it looks very nice however, they do not accept pets. Best I can tell is that Cedar Lake Lodge and Keystone are the only two on that lake that do. Currently waiting to hear back on openings at Keystone as it is a drive to camp VS being isolated on an island. Any input as far as the 3rd week in May? Is there a better time?"
5221434,BornToFish,2016-12-08 09:00:00,1224,"Greetings,I encourage you to investigate potential requirements that you must satisfy to bring a pet either way across the US/Canada border. It may not be as simple as you might expect it to be.Many years ago, my friends were bringing their dog with them to Canada. I remember they had certain requirements that they had to satisfy, but unfortunately do not remember what those requirements were at the time. The requirements have almost certainly changed since then.One year, my friends had to dispose of their dog's food when they crossed the border and had to buy new dog food once across.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5221538,Plotman,2016-12-08 09:41:00,394,"I actually dreaded it the first time expecting problems however, All that is required is that the (1)pet be accompanied by the owner (2) signed document by licensed veterinarian of rabies vaccination in last 36 months and (3) no dog food. The last requirement concerned us the most as sometimes a dogs digestive tract doesn't do so good if their usual dog food is changed. Taking our dog severely limits our lodging options however, she has been with us for over 10 years and behaves better than some people I have encountered. Most importantly this is a family trip and you know the old saying ""happy wife, happy life""!"
