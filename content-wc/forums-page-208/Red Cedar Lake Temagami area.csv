5231978,Shellback,2016-12-18 05:59:00,8083,"I did look at their website, and it looks nice. I've fished Bob's Lake, and a number of lakes in the Rideau area, and was looking for something more remote. I'll be in Gananoque late May, early June, I could take a ride up there and check it out. By then they might be booked up though."
5231994,Bobby Winds,2016-12-18 06:21:00,10817,"Actually it's pretty remote with a LOT of undeveloped shoreline, hardly any other cottages with lots of remote bays and islands.Take a look at the map here if I linked it properly......hardly any roads around the lake.https://www.google.com/maps/@44.8102...3985,14z?hl=en"
5233234,mickr,2016-12-19 13:50:00,74,"i know the lakes in the land of lakes area well. I wouldn't consider any of the lakes in that area nearly as good as what you can find in your 8 hr driving range from Kingston. But if you do look in that area, I'd consider Kashwakamak and Skootamatta as better walleye lakes than Big Gull. Lots of suggestions for the Temagami / Kipawa area. I think you'd do just as well or better heading straight north from Ottawa"
5236802,northernbite,2016-12-23 06:20:00,1186,"I was there around 2009. I would look elsewhere. If you are going to camp fine, if to catch a lot of walleye not so much. I'll say no more. Paul"
5242634,Shellback,2016-12-28 12:40:00,8083,"Decided to bite the bullet and head farther west to the Chapleau area. Booked a cabin for July 15-22, and they also have camping available. With the 3 days traveling, I'll just bring camping gear with me, and if I want to stretch the trip out, I'll camp for a couple days. If they have a cabin available he will rent it for a couple nights also."
5226730,Shellback,2016-12-13 10:42:00,8083,"Anybody fished Red Cedar lake? Looking for a place within an 8 hour drive from Kingston, ON. The wife and I would just like to rent a housekeeping cottage and bring our own boat. Not looking for trophy fish and would be happy with some good walleye and perch fishing."
5229490,mickr,2016-12-15 15:11:00,74,I have fished there. did a 3 nighter there in the fall of 2015. The problem with 3 night stays is they are short. Weather can ruin a 3 day outing. We had bad weather when we were there. We did get some nice walleye but we worked hard for them. the concern I had with thst place was rock and a rather unhelpful lodge owner. lots of rock not enough marked shoals.
5229498,Shellback,2016-12-15 16:11:00,8083,"Can't do much about the weather, but the camp doesn't sound so great. PM me the camp you used if you don't mind. thanks, Ron"
5231586,retire55,2016-12-17 12:40:00,1029,"You might want to consider fishing in Quebec in lieu of Ontario. The TÃ©miscaming, Quebec area is approximately 40 miles east of Red Cedar Lake. Lake Kipawa is the biggest lake in that area (over 50 miles long) and is home to about 20 outfitters. Other shield lakes in the area include Lake Ogascanan, Lake Sasseginaga and Lake Kikwissi. Bathymetric maps are available for all these lakes. These four lakes offer walleye, lake trout and northern pike fishing. Of note, the walleye possession limit is 6. Maximum harvest length is 21 inches (about a 3 pound walleye). I've been walleye fishing in this area since 2000."
5231714,spurs101,2016-12-17 16:00:00,635,Have you fished the Sass? Wondering how has it been lately.
5231754,ohiojmj,2016-12-17 16:57:00,1262,I have fished several times at Red cedar Lake. I think there a good number of camps and resulting fishing pressure. Consider going further north. Lady Evelyn Lake is more remote. The more remote lakes in Quebec would also be better. Sent from my SCH-I545 using Tapatalk
5231818,Shellback,2016-12-17 18:42:00,8083,The Sassafras river at the head of the Chesapeake? About ready to get started there soon. Mostly fish it Jan thru March for perch. The past couple years have been poor.
5231826,Shellback,2016-12-17 18:52:00,8083,Folks seem to be recommending Quebec over eastern Ontario. I'll have to start looking that way.
5231890,adempsey2.0,2016-12-17 20:52:00,612,"Ivanhoe Lake might be worth a look. True jumbo perch and reasonable walleye fishing. Might be worth checking out some of the boat-to camps from Air Ivanhoe and Red Pine Lodge. We stayed at Red Pine Wilderness Resort and it was a bit busy since there's a trailer park there. However, the cottages along the beach are somewhat secluded and really nice. Amazing beach. Air Ivanhoe has some nice accommodations too.Kipawa is a beautiful lake, but not necessarily the easiest to fish. Not sure if there's perch there, but good laker and smallmouth fishing. If you like the remote feel, but maybe bad to awesome fishing, then it's definitely worth a look. Over a dozen places you can stay, including some boat-to outpost camps - it's a huge body of water. Horwood Lake might be another consideration, but again, I don't recall there being any perch. Fishing is average to good for walleye. Crazy logs every morning though, definitely an interesting experience.Lady Evelyn is another to look in to. Not sure how much of a pain it is to bring your own boat though. You have to go down the river and then trailer your boat up and past the dam. Costs like $20 I think. Probably the best walleye fishing I've had in the area and the lake is beautiful. Ellen Island Camp has housekeeping cottages. I think Red Pine Lodge does as well. Somewhat on the higher price though.There some nice places on the French River too, but in my limited experience the walleye fishing was not that good."
5231954,Bobby Winds,2016-12-18 03:32:00,10817,Although it looks great on paper (map) the Temagami area has always been a tough act when it comes to walleye fishing....not sure why but it is. And you will be driving by a lot better lakes to get there. I believe I told you about Kirk's Kove on Big Gull Lake........you will like it better and it's a LOT closer to drive to.
