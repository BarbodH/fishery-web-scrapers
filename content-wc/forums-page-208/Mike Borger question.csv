I'm a huge fan of Moose's story's of Nip of the years, and those story's have done thing but left me very hungry to visit this amazing place .Both of these guys have had some awesome trips, and both have a special gift of writing about these adventurers."
5241242,Mike Borger,2016-12-27 11:11:00,1554,"As far as drive-to destinations for ""numbers"" of trophy pike within a reasonable driving distance of International Falls there's not a ton. Numbers of big pike at a drive-to lake is usually a tall order. That said there are some obvious options.1. Lake Nipigon. Easily the best trophy pike fishery that's not a fly in in northwestern Ontario. It's world class and very much underutilized. The only thing is the best way to fish it is by loading your boat with camping gear and camping on one of the islands.2. Shoal Lake connected to LOTW. Speaking with an MNR biologist in Kenora earlier this year who is also an avid angler, he told me the trophy pike fishery in Shoal is incredible. Many years ago the mag I used to write for, Ontario Out Of Doors, rated Shoal Lake as the number one drive-to trophy pike lake in Ontario. Based on that alone I'd probably look at it real hard. Nice thing about Shoal, it's a pretty big body of water with only one lodge operating on it.3. A bit more off the radar but worth mentioning if you're willing to do a canoe trip - Pickeral Lake in Quetico Park west of Thunder Bay. Pickeral is one of the access lakes on the north side of the park meaning there is no portaging required to access it. Park your vehicle and go. I have paddled through Pickeral a number of times early in the season and the quality of the trophy pike fishery is awesome. One time in late May a buddy and I caught more than a dozen fish over 40"" out of one bay on the last afternoon of our trip. Pickeral also has great fishing for lake trout, walleye and smallmouth bass and some tremendous island campsites. If you don't mind that type of trip it's a great option.4. If you're willing to drive much further to experience truly world class pike fishing, it would be VERY hard to beat Reindeer Lake in northern Saskatchewan. Specifically Grand Slam Lodge. http://www.grandslamlodge.com/ It's a very long drive, but so worth it! Just to put Reindeer in perspective I've talked at length with Lawrence Bay Lodge which flies its guests in from Southend Saskatchewan and is located about 20 miles up the lake from Grand Slam. Last season they recorded 1600 pike 40"" or greater caught by their guests during the short season from mid June to early September. That is an astounding number.5. Also famous for churning out giant numbers of big pike is Reed Lake in far northern Manitoba. I'm not suggesting you use these guys but Grass River Lodge has an interesting website: http://www.grassriverlodge.com/rates.htmlHope that helps at least a bit!Cheers"
5241842,That Minnesota guy,2016-12-27 19:17:00,8293,Thank you Mike.
5239258,That Minnesota guy,2016-12-25 18:42:00,8293,"Looking for your top 4 or 5 DRIVE TO Pike lakes. Would cross at International Falls Minnesota. Looking for fish in the 40"" and larger class. Also the time of year you believe is best. I understand ice out is prime time but thats pretty hard to plan in advance for. Any suggestions, tips, hints by anybody is appriciated. Thank you."

5239434,123chadder,2016-12-25 23:32:00,429,"please reply to this thread and not pm mike,as id love to know as well..."
5239610,Obabikon,2016-12-26 09:06:00,2370,"Merry Christmas everyone... While it'll be interesting to hear what Mike says of the I-falls border crossing options.... if you have the $$$ Lake Athabasca is without a doubt the easiest guarantee for 40""+ (should be multiple daily). With a shot at 50"""
5239650,wallydave,2016-12-26 09:55:00,2151,"I just checked the website, it looks like it's for sale due to some health issues. Too bad it looks like a nice place."
5239730,Lazy Fisherman,2016-12-26 10:40:00,276,Is Lake Athabasca a drive in lodge?
5239962,Moosebunk,2016-12-26 13:22:00,211,"Drive to lodge, no. Drive to lake... it'd be a loooooong trip. A good few quality drive to lakes I'd imagine in N.W. Ontario especially, but they wouldn't compare to many fly-in options which Mike surely has great experiences with. The best drive to lake in Ontario for pike in my opinion is Lake Nipigon. Overlooked because of it's lake and speckled trout fishing, the pike on this vast, relatively untouched waterbody reach sizes as big as anywhere else in Canada and yet hardly anyone goes looking for them. You gotta be adventurous to get into the best of it and sometimes be willing to sacrifice numbers in the pursuit of true giants."
5240002,That Minnesota guy,2016-12-26 13:42:00,8293,Nip is already on the list. It will happen in 2017 just looking for another trip or two. Moose I read your report on your trip (it was great BTW) Just curious how far you were from Pasha Lake Lodge? If I stay at Pasha is it a short hop with a decent launch site to Nip?
5240138,Moosebunk,2016-12-26 14:23:00,211,"Your options for launches in the area near Pasha are at Beardmore or onto the Onaman River at O.R.R. There's a VERY rough launch into Ombabika Bay as well but expect a trailering time of at least an hour or two on rougher roads and the potential for washouts. Early season pike investigate shallow warming back bays ANYWHERE (but especially south facing or with creeks) or, if going beyond early to mid July, generally the pike are set up in deeper cabbage &/or warmer shoreline structures. Pasha should be able to key you in on spots depending where you launch. But, I'd suggest studying shorelines (and hazards) and areas of interest with Google Earth. Research ahead of time for Nipigon can make or break or trip."
5240306,prov1800,2016-12-26 15:36:00,5010,"Just thought i would mention northstar lodge on clay lake.28 mi if water that has current from one end to the other.it has a fantastic pike population and not a lot of pressure on them ad lodge guest mainly target walleye.pike stay shallow on this lake due to the current.plenty of great weed beds and reefs.plenty in the 40"" range if you target them.reasonable place to stay and only lodge as well."
