5134890,BornToFish,2016-09-30 12:43:00,1224,"Greetings, My wife and I have taken numerous trips to a particular fishing lodge in NW Ontario. We have always been on the housekeeping plan. We typically fished in the early morning, and then came in for breakfast when the morning walleye bite slowed down. We would fish for perch, bass, northerns or muskies during the middle of the day - whatever my wife decided she was in the mood for. We ended each day with the traditional evening walleye bite. Supper could be at 4:00 p.m. or at 10:00 p.m. - depending on how the day went. We recently vacationed at another camp that was American Plan only. I wasn't too sure how that would work for us, given that meals were served at fixed times. As others have already mentioned, I would not want to leave good fishing for two or more hours, to simply have a meal served to us. It worked extremely well for us. My wife loved having hot meals served to her at set times. My wife and I made some friends that we probably would not have met had we not shared meals together. The walleye fishing was so good throughout the day, that we didn't mind sleeping later than normal and forego the early morning bite. The old saying comes to mind: ""happy wife = happy life!"". Someone mentioned having to take a guide at certain lodges. I'm wondering if a consideration for this might be to show guests safe navigational corridors. As many others have set forth, I personally don't feel a need to hire a guide as I normally manage to figure things out on my own. Good fishing and tight lines!!"

That's the only exception for me though. Quote: Originally Posted by Richard BNo guides. Finding new areas to fish are part of the enjoyment. Don't mind the dinner schedule.

If we where fishing out of boats with anything less that 30 horses it could be a pain.Big boats probably wouldn't change my mind, but I get your point.Quote: Originally Posted by DeBoI enjoy the figuring it out all on my own part , but if I ever start on a new large system I will hire a well respected guide for a day the first trip.

Show me the motor killers on a map and I will figure it out on my own.I CAN NOT STAND the concept of a fishing trip being on a rigid schedule. It makes 0 sense whatsoever. 4:45 with a southerly breeze and a cloud deck moving in... Hey let's go eat dinner for 2 hours??? + driving time? Some trips we go in to the cabin for a lunch break if it makes sense but there is always food in the boat if a meal needs to be skipped/delayed.I've only ever been on one fishing trip where it was on a schedule with guides. That was for Golden Dorado in Argentina and under the circumstances it worked out great. But I definitely wanted more time on the water!Someone else mostly on the same page.Quote: Originally Posted by bthomas3333Hey - I agree fishing on a schedule can be tough and the idea of being guided by someone with little to no experience would be a 'challenge'. I guess my experience has been that any lodge will make a dinner plate and put it in a frid for you. That solves the schedule issue. For me anyway...The guide issue is tougher. I can only think of one situation where you might appreciate a guide. Fishing alone in weather. This last season I added a last minute solo trip. I went out first night alone and it was a real 'S@#t S#$w 3 ft rollers and 20mph wind. The fish were biting on a wind blown point but every fish took a could of minutes to 'deal' with and while I netted / unhooked / picture. I was getting blown towards the point. It took me a couple of mins to deal with repositioning the boat not to mention the general risk of not being in control of a boat in 3ft rollers. I guess the better answer would've been to leave the bite and find a sheltered spot to fish, but I have never been a fan of leaving one bite to find another. Anyway I probably should've taken a guide out with me. Of course if the fish weren't biting so well it would've been a big deal.My two cents...B-I think fishing solo even I'd appreciate a guide for the banter and company if nothing else.Quote: Originally Posted by HeHooksHimselfGuides- We have never hired a guide and I could be way off, but from what I have seen it seems like some guides are simply snickering at the idea of ""rich"" Americans coming to a camp to say they have the experience of Canadian fishing. We were at one camp and loved how they ran there operation, but using the same waters was another camp with the schedule and mandatory guides that Mike alludes to. We found the guides obnoxious as they would horn in on us fishing as if we weren't there. We were close enough to hear them interact with their customers, telling them where to throw and displaying great impatience if they did not get an immediate bite. Now, I am not saying every guide or every operation is like that but, admittedly, it gave us a bad impression of the whole guide idea. I get enough of getting told what to do at work and I go to Canada to have a completely different experience.Schedule- Again, my typical life is scheduled. The only reason I take a watch to Canada is to figure out how long it is to sunset. We are more inclined to come in during the afternoon, have our one substantial meal and be out until dark for the later bite. However, if we are sitting on a hole we like the flexibility of doing what we want.I guess what I am saying is that I agree with Mike's premise. At the same time, I don't have the experience he has. Additionally, I know there are guides who are probably excellent and become part of the team in a short time. They can probably save you hours by identifying productive spots. There is certainly a place for them, but probably not in my boat.Fish On!HooksI think pretty much all of the guides I've encountered have been decent enough people. I just don't want them on my tiller LOL! I haven't seen any obnoxious guides thank goodness.Quote: Originally Posted by adempsey2.0Quit your tangential ruminating and contemplating and finish the **** reports!

There's zero wait, there's zero dishes or clean up... there's more fishing time.As far as guides... there are pros out there. I get why there's enjoyment in doing it yourself. However, there can be a lot of fun in being guided too. Meeting new people with new ideas. Different thoughts about fish theory and why they do what they do.That sounds way more reasonable Jared, but I'd still hate the schedule.Most every night my group and I fishes until dusk, no matter what the time of year. That means some long days on the water especially in June. Only exception to that is bad weather. We'll get into camp at dusk then convene on the deck with drinks while we bbq something with headlamps on. It's a daily ritual that I love and frankly missed at a couple of the lodges this year. I'm fairly driven and I'm not going to deny it. Guides have a place, I know that, just not for me. I could have Al Lindner himself in my boat and I'd still get aggravated."

After dinner dad chided me (not playing cards) for putting a shot gun down one wader, wading staff and fly rod in hands as I was off fishing at 9pm.

However, I also figured out I do not like a set schedule, 8am is way to late to LEAVE the lodge to go fishing, 4pm is way to early to come back in for supper. The ride across the ice during those three days was at minimum 45 minutes one way in a cramped loud rough bomber, with booze laden hungover people in the morning and booze laden drunk obnoxious folks in the evening. The fishing was far less than stellar, Im not at all excited about catching 13'' saugers, especially not any more than 6 a day total between the two of us, and the ''guide'' would not move us, rather just said keep trying, this is very frustrating for a very avid fisherman. Now Im not saying we didn't enjoy ourselves, because we did but I figured out what Im NOT into, further adventures, will have no guide, will go off fishing reports from lodge and locally, would rent atv or snow machines for transportation. If its open water we have our own boat so we would use it. Theres just too many constraints on an all inclusive trip, Im on the water or ice when most if not all people are still sleeping, and Im off when most people are already at the bar.

It may happen before or after the euchre game which determines who washes dishes, or it may happen during the light rain that moved in after sunrise, but we fish when we want. We eat when we want. One of the young studs has decided that he's the camp chef, and he's given us no reason to argue. He plans out the items needed for meals we might eat, and we head to the grocery in Thunder Bay on the way to camp to fill our pantry in the cabin. We eat when we're hungry, we fish when we want. We listen to the camp manager for his advice about the lake, and by the end of the week, he's part of our family. Rum and Budweiser does that to a guy. This past year was the first time I'd fished with my West Coast brother in forty years. He's not normally into fishing and I supplied all his gear, but by the end of the week, no one was going to out-fish him. We had a blast being together in a boat for eight to ten hours a day, and he learned to handled a one ounce spoon like a pro!

The crowd I went with would have breakfast in the morning and be off for the day. We did housekeeping so we didn't have to depend or be restricted by someone else. No guides, as we were lucky enough to have one or two locals and another who had a cabin on McKenzie Island and always caught fish. Today I still go the housekeeping route, but I prefer a resort with a restaurant/bar or one close by. Gives me the option of a fish fry, BBQ or just eating out. As far as guides, usually you have to go in their boat, not gonna happen, nor do I want an extra person in my boat I don't know. Over the years I have found guides and offered to just pay for some starting points on lakes I've never fished. None have taken the cash, but I have bought a few something like a beer and burger.

5226874,wallydave,2016-12-13 12:44:00,2151,"42, I was fishing wit Pat at BBL for his first trip to Red Lake, we stayed at the newer cabin between the Lodge and the shower house. They had to move it a couple of years ago, something about not being on their boundaries. The old lodge was looking pretty bad, I hope they can use that space for a gazebo or something like that."

5243074,Multispecies Guy,2016-12-28 17:38:00,447,"I've done housekeeping and American plan. Both have their place but I do like the flexibility of housekeeping. I can survive on trail mix and venison jerky for a week of fishing. I've hired guides on a few occasions, mostly for Lake Michigan salmon and trout. I can't see hiring one for bass or muskies, my usual pursuits. As Mike Borger mentioned, putting a pattern together is the real challenge. I love the payoff of figuring things out, getting a hit and feeling a solid fish on the hook set. A prior poster mentioned getting chewed out by a camp owner for missing a meal. Camp owners feel a responsibility for their guests and when one doesn't show up when expected the owner worries and may even organize a search. He was probably worked up with worry, not anger."
5245682,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2016-12-30 12:44:00,240,"One of the biggest highlights of my summer is when my family and I spend a week at Gunflint Lodge in Northern Minnesota, on the Minnesota/Canada border. I spend 3 days of that week in the company of a guide I met almost 20 years ago. It is a rare treat to be catered to, and fishing lakes like Saganaga is so much easier when you are with a guy who is on the water several months of the year. Have caught the biggest walleyes of my life, up to 33"", on these annual trips. I don't need someone to outfit me, or otherwise give me any help with the actual fishing, but being with a guy who is dialed in to some good spots on a large, island-studded lake like Saganaga, or big water like Gunflint or North, is invaluable.I love the fly-in trips where we do absolutely everything for ourselves, but I do admit to equally enjoying the company of a guy who is more friend than guide."
5147409,Guest,2016-10-10 08:20:00,0,"I have been on several trips to MN where we got a guide for one day to help us figure out depths, baits etc.... ask some questions. Nobody else really willing to help you fish out their lake. Then the rest of the week fish his spots and find new ones. Might not need it in Canada but other places really tough to figure it out on your own if you only have 4-5 days and weather plays a factor."
5148609,fishron,2016-10-10 18:54:00,317,"Mike brings up a question that is more pertinent as the years go by with my fishing group. Where does the emphasis of a fishing trip lie with the people you fish with. American plan lodges offer more of a vacation experience than a purely fishing experience. I'm sure none of my group would change the great times we had over the years with our families in an all inclusive plan with our families. If you want to catch fish and do it to the most productive level you need to be on the water and not constrained by a set program. I find myself in a group of fisherman that want to participate in the enjoyment of the fishing experience by not to exclusion of having a relaxing, enjoyable, and fulfilling interlude in their daily lives. We don't desire to travel great distances or pay a lot of money for our sport. I know that limits our options for great fishing but its a balance of enjoyment and productivity that we are more often accepting as we get older. I cherish each and every experience that I've had over the years and continue to search out new opportunities."
5222674,MrSimon,2016-12-09 07:17:00,922,"Just found this thread and enjoyed reading it! We went to a lodge once that prepared meals on a fixed schedule. The food was very good, the people friendly, and we very much enjoyed the dining experience. But we'll never do it again!!!!! The fixed schedule was too limiting for us. We also realized that preparing our own food is part of the fun. Regarding guides .... I'm positive most are better fishermen than we are and if we hired one, we'd catch more fish. But having a stranger in our boat (or being in a strangers boat) is the exact opposite of why we go to Canada."
5223257,Guest,2016-12-09 16:09:00,0,"My son and I have gone to the same lodge on Red Lake (Ontario, not MN) for 7 years now--our only Canadian experience, and we've been given no reason to look elsewhere. Lodge owners are the only staff there. Breakfast is at 8am, dinner is at 5pm, and you're expected to be at both unless you make prior arrangements. I initially had an issue with the 5pm dinner...until Jillian explained that it's as much of a safety issue as a convenience-for-them issue. For example, if there are 15 guests in camp that week, there will be 15 plates ready to get loaded with entirely too much good food. If it's 5:15 and there are empty plates, somebody is likely lost or stranded somewhere on that 44,000 acre lake...and there is still enough daylight left to go find them. Given that it's just the two of them, and that there is no cell phone service, they need to make sure they have enough time to search. That made a lot of sense to me. If we're heading out early to fish and suspect we might miss the morning vittles, it's really not too much to ask of us to let them know that the night before. Yes, we have had to leave a hot bite to head back to camp...but generally figure it's pretty likely that we'll get into another hot bite during the week. Leaving that bite is nowhere near as painful as when we're leaving camp at the end of our stay...puts the once-in-a-while inconvenience into perspective, at least for us. After dinner, we take turns on KP, then back out to fish. Generally have one meal per week that keeps us in the kitchen for an extra 30 minutes cleaning up. I can live with that. We're usually the only ones that bring our own boat, so we're the only ones with lights, and the camp owners have come to realize that they aren't likely to see us until well after dark. They're totally fine with that. Once, we came back in at about 9:30pm and they came out to see what was ""wrong"" since we came back so ""early."" Even with the ""rigid"" schedule, there have only been a couple of days that we weren't on the water 10+ hours, and those were weather related (except for 2016, when my boat hull cracked and we were sinking. That, for some reason, brought us back to camp...) As for guides...never actually had on official guide, but our first year up there we were getting our tails kicked. Totally foreign lake, 8x bigger than anything we've fished before...I think we caught a total of 4 walleye in the first 2 days. Just could not figure it out. Asked Jim (one of the owners) for some advice. He had us follow him that night to a spot, gave us an idea of how to improve our presentation--and most importantly, told us why that spot was good, so that we could figure it out on our own from there. Needless to say, it has been bliss ever since. As has been mentioned before, advice from the lodge owner (or anyone that lives on the water) is priceless. Full ""vacation"" style lodge: definitely not for me. Having to do every single thing for myself (when it's just the two of us in our party): also not my idea. I, for one, am very happy with the schedule/freedom mix where we go. -42"
5223329,Mike Borger,2016-12-09 18:18:00,1554,An excellent and thoughtful response! It sounds as though you have found the perfect spot for you.
5223570,pjshorthorn,2016-12-10 06:26:00,5654,"Ahhh.......good ol Black Bear Lodge. My son and I fished there in 2014 with WallyDave and Breezy Point. It was a great trip and we all enjoyed the camp atmosphere. Although the cabins are rustic, they were very comfortable and spaced nicely from other cabins. Although others on this forum have complained about the scheduled meal plan, we didn't mind at all. During our week everyone in camp decided to do a community clean up after each meal where it literally took 5-10 minutes to have everything done as opposed to 30-40 minutes. We typically were back in the boat leaving the dock by 5:30 pm ish for the evening bite. We would fish till dark, come in and build a campfire, tell stories and wait for the northern lights to show up. My son and I caught a personal best pike and walleye respectively on that trip and made some great friendships to boot. One of these years he and I will go back and try to learn the lake even more. For a remote American Plan camp, I think one would be very surprised at how affordable it is for a week's stay which includes the opportunity to fish other remote lakes each day . If you are interested, send your email address and I'll send you a marked up map where we had success all the way up into Pipestone Bay. PjShorthorn"
5223674,wallydave,2016-12-10 07:16:00,2151,"Black Bear Lodge!!! A truly unique experience! The meal plan is very good! Not having to bring all the food sure makes for a less stressful trip. There is a vibe there that's hard to explain. I have been there a couple of times, once with Mike Kansas, and then with Breezy Point and pjshorthorn and his son Ben. Late evenings around the fire, waiting for a Northern Lights display in the August sky, a big breakfast, pack a lunch and hit the lake! Like Pat said, I could go back anytime!"
5137210,fishmanric,2016-10-02 11:04:00,219,Have fished Canada for over forty years and agree with the consensus on this board. Like doing my own thing without any time constraints. Have never used a guide but could see using them on a short trip on new waters. One of the reasons for going to Canada is that you can catch all kinds of fish without a guide or even live bait on certain lakes.
5137282,pike50plus,2016-10-02 13:11:00,584,"and know what you went trough, my take is only different because I had to go solo this year and really needed a guide due to a medical condition. I lucked out with a great guide who was also a non-smoker (big deal for me) and we had fun together. The fishing at that lake was outstanding. As you rightfully point out the Camp mrg and your guide were a problem! The schedule and mandatory shore lunch policy or peanut butter and jelly take a lunch was ridiculous, especially when they had a 5 star chief there. I do think it was over priced for the accomodations. I too normally like the self guided because of the fishing time concern. We should just buy the other camp at the western end of the lake and make it self-guided or guided by request!!!! We know the fishing was top notch! Sam"
5137298,Mike Borger,2016-10-02 13:47:00,1554,"What do you mean ""we"" should buy the other camp? LOL!"
5137874,forgop,2016-10-03 01:55:00,880,"And no pictures of the fish either. They must go directly back in the water so there's no evidence of your trophy.

5138113,Baseline,2016-10-03 07:10:00,3207,"The resort menu caters to all comers. Personally I don't care to have a guide or a schedule and my friends and I are DIY types. We usually do boat in trips and we use our truck campers in the warmer months. I've also been on several corporate trips to some very nice resorts where I had a lodge room and was paired with one or two different people everyday. Breakfast was usually at 6:30 am with boats leaving the docks shortly after 7 am returning at 5:00 pm with dinner a 6. Drinks and BS after that. I also fished with very nice people and a few rookies who quickly became hooked on fishing Canada. The lakes were so loaded with fish that anyone could learn 3 spots to try by looking at a map so the guides were there to drive the boat to a spot, cook lunch and clean the fish and boat when we were through for the day. This type of trip is not my personal preference, but I can see that they have a place in the market."
5138185,Stauff,2016-10-03 08:03:00,110,"American Plan – not a consideration. Guide? And, miss out on all the mishaps? No way. You see, our annual trip to the Ogoki Reservoir has turned into family time. Brothers, sons, uncles, and an occasional friend of the family. Yes, it’s a fishing trip and one that will have all of us dreaming about next year’s trip, but it’s really the experience. Back home I tend to fish with a lot more serious attitude. I know the lakes we’re on, I know what I’m after, and I know the patterns. The mission is FISH!. When we head north, fishing just happens. It may happen before or after the euchre game which determines who washes dishes, or it may happen during the light rain that moved in after sunrise, but we fish when we want. We eat when we want. One of the young studs has decided that he’s the camp chef, and he’s given us no reason to argue. He plans out the items needed for meals we might eat, and we head to the grocery in Thunder Bay on the way to camp to fill our pantry in the cabin. We eat when we’re hungry, we fish when we want. We listen to the camp manager for his advice about the lake, and by the end of the week, he’s part of our family. Rum and Budweiser does that to a guy. This past year was the first time I'd fished with my West Coast brother in forty years. He's not normally into fishing and I supplied all his gear, but by the end of the week, no one was going to out-fish him. We had a blast being together in a boat for eight to ten hours a day, and he learned to handled a one ounce spoon like a pro! Our Canada fishing trip is our vacation, but more importantly a family experience."
5138681,DaBirdman,2016-10-03 14:40:00,164,"The one time I think it would be fun having a guide for a day is when your guide is an old grizzlied kind of guy who knows a lot of history about the lake, the area and has years upon years of outdoor experiences under his belt. I enjoy talking with guys who have many interesting life experiences. And what better way to do that than doing it while catching a pile of fish!"

5139297,Whopper,2016-10-04 06:04:00,340,When I read the title to this thread I was sure Mike was going to talk about the importance of having enough gas in the boat
5137066,Crede,2016-10-02 09:08:00,134,"To answer Mr. Borger's questions: 1) Yes. Quality of the fishery trumps all else. However, you know more than anyone that there are numerous quality fisheries and that their ""rank"" varies from week to week. But when we book each year, quality fishery is #1 consideration. Size of our group is #2. If small group (4 or less) we usually end up at an American plan lodge. If a larger group, we often go housekeeping for $ reasons. 2) I have never been to a place which required guides. We have only been to places which offer (not require) guides. We have sometimes gotten a guide for one day. I would consider a guide-requiring lodge if going to really big water in northern Saskatchewan or Alaska. Can't see it for anyplace I might go in Ontario. 3) 2 hours for dinner annoys me when we are at a nice restaurant here at home for our anniversary. Haven't had anything like that at an American plan fly in lodge. 4) We have been flying into American plan lodges, housekeeping lodges, and single cabin lakes for the last 25 years out of Nakina, Armstrong, and Pickle Lake. For whatever reason, we spend about the same amount of time fishing no matter which one we are at. We end up out of the boat for a little more than an hour for dinner each evening. I have found that the fixed schedule lodges have some flexibility built in re: breakfast and dinner times if I ask nicely. And truthfully, I rarely ask now (maybe one meal in a week). 5) Our general schedule no matter what the setup is: quick breakfast, fish, 30 minute shore lunch (our shore lunch is 30 minutes eating sandwiches/snacks while standing on the shore. 45 minutes at Makokibatan Lodge where they do a shore lunch 8-10 miles from the Lodge every day. We plan our morning to end up there at noon most days). Fish. Back to camp around 5:30PM. Dinner. Fish until sunset. If anything, we probably fish slightly more at the American plan lodges as we do less of the cooking/housekeeping/camping chores."
5135217,DaBirdman,2016-09-30 16:27:00,164,"I absolutely loathe being put on any type of schedule when on fishing trips/vacations. Years ago we vacationed with other relatives and an actual written out list of who was grilling, on which day, and at which time they were to start the grill was distributed to those of us that did the grilling. I couldn't stand it! Those relatives no longer go on the vacations and we just play it loosy goosy. Fish as early as you want. Fish as late as you want. We all like to eat late anyway. We just keep the coals going or the oven on low heat for those that want to eat later than others. As for a guide, I've never hired or used one. I would MUCH rather unfold a lake map and visit with the resort owners about spots to try, depths & structure to fish, etc and then go out & do it myself. If I were to ever hire a guide, my guide would have to be the resort owner, or one of the resort owner's kids if they have kids old enough & responsible enough to guide. I'd want a guide who lives & breaths on the lake. One who has an intimate knowledge of the lake and it's history. Otherwise, no. No guide for me. Getting pointed in the right direction looking at a lake map, then going out & trying, exploring and figuring it out is more fun for me. Plus I love to study lake maps.

5135449,reconssd,2016-09-30 19:56:00,147,"Mike - you post a very interesting set of questions. I found out the hard way about 30 years ago on LOTW. My girl friend at the time, (now my wife) stayed at a lodge with set times, etc. I won't mention the lodge and all I will say is the lodge is still in business today. On our first full day of fishing, we missed lunch. When we got into the camp around 2pm, we were greeted by the camp cook and the lodge owner. They proceeded to chew me/us out for missing lunch. Now, if my girl friend wasn't there, I can promise you it would have escalated into one of those ugly american"" situations. Instead, I apologized and bit my tongue. I told them we would not be eating any of their food the remainder of our trip. We didn't even stay the full week because that episode really ticked me off. For your quide question, we got a guide about 16 years ago on Eagle Lake. What a waste of time and money. I learned very quickly that half the fun of fishing Canada is finding fish on your own. The thrill is definitely in the hunt. Like so many of you had said, Canada is about the freedom to come and go as you please. No schedule, no nothing. Canada for me is sacred ground and I cherish every trip I make to either the Ontario or Manitoba provinces. No demands or time tables. We fish hard and maximize our time on the water every day. It doesn't get any better than that."
5134578,Mike Borger,2016-09-30 09:24:00,1554,"All of my trips this past year were great, but one really important lesson was learned.I've been on a lot of trips over the years, mostly outpost camps, but a good number of lodges as well.This will likely mean missing out on some great fisheries, but never again will I go to a lodge where I'm on a set schedule. It's just not for me. There's plenty of lodges that don't have rigid schedules and those ones would still interest me.There's nothing I hate more than having to return to camp at 5pm for dinner every day then finally being finished at 7pm. I'd rather fish.Most importantly NEVER again will I ever be guided. I can't stand it, even if the person is competent. It takes every ounce of enjoyment I have for the sport away from me as figuring things out is the challenge and the fun part for me. Usually I'm pretty successful at it.This was reinforced by a nightmarish experience I had this year at a lodge which will remain nameless. My ""guide"" had zero experience on the lake and was a rank amateur as far as fishing goes. It was a total gong show LOL!So what say you? Especially the experienced anglers among you. Would you fish at a lodge if you were on a schedule and had to be guided? Would the quality of the fishery itself outweigh the schedule and the guiding? Am I being too rigid?"
5134586,johnboat,2016-09-30 09:36:00,2014,"Set schedules would never work for me or my group. We enjoy the freedom of having lunch from 11:00am to 2:00pm or Supper from 5:00 to 10:30 at night depending on the bite, weather, or our mood. I would never leave a hot bite or just a beautiful evening out on the lake to run back to camp and eat. I can't comment on the guides as I never had one and probably never will."
5134594,Shortline,2016-09-30 09:42:00,234,"I would never say never, but in all reality, I prefer the no-schedule, guideless route. Of course some trips on my wish list would not allow that - such as steelheading in BC or SE Alaska, as I would need a guide, since I am not buying a jetboat.... Personally, my favorite trips are remote trips where we boat in and camp (like islands out on Nipigon, or Isle Royale)."

We like coming in early to wash up, relax, eat, and then out again until dark. But my group is running boats with 200+ horse motors and can cover a lot of distance very quickly. If we where fishing out of boats with anything less that 30 horses it could be a pain."
5134762,DeBo,2016-09-30 11:27:00,211,"I enjoy the figuring it out all on my own part , but if I ever start on a new large system I will hire a well respected guide for a day the first trip. I will be on drive to and my own boat adventures so navigation help and general thoughts/details on the fishery are worth a lot. If I was fishing remote water with very light fishing pressure? Show me the motor killers on a map and I will figure it out on my own. I CAN NOT STAND the concept of a fishing trip being on a rigid schedule. It makes 0 sense whatsoever. 4:45 with a southerly breeze and a cloud deck moving in... Hey let's go eat dinner for 2 hours??? + driving time? Some trips we go in to the cabin for a lunch break if it makes sense but there is always food in the boat if a meal needs to be skipped/delayed. I've only ever been on one fishing trip where it was on a schedule with guides. That was for Golden Dorado in Argentina and under the circumstances it worked out great. But I definitely wanted more time on the water!"

I guess my experience has been that any lodge will make a dinner plate and put it in a frid for you. That solves the schedule issue. For me anyway...The guide issue is tougher. I can only think of one situation where you might appreciate a guide. Fishing alone in weather. This last season I added a last minute solo trip. I went out first night alone and it was a real 'S@#t S#$w 3 ft rollers and 20mph wind. The fish were biting on a wind blown point but every fish took a could of minutes to 'deal' with and while I netted / unhooked / picture. I was getting blown towards the point. It took me a couple of mins to deal with repositioning the boat not to mention the general risk of not being in control of a boat in 3ft rollers. I guess the better answer would've been to leave the bite and find a sheltered spot to fish, but I have never been a fan of leaving one bite to find another. Anyway I probably should've taken a guide out with me. Of course if the fish weren't biting so well it would've been a big deal.My two cents...B-"

We were at one camp and loved how they ran there operation, but using the same waters was another camp with the schedule and mandatory guides that Mike alludes to. We found the guides obnoxious as they would horn in on us fishing as if we weren't there. We were close enough to hear them interact with their customers, telling them where to throw and displaying great impatience if they did not get an immediate bite. Now, I am not saying every guide or every operation is like that but, admittedly, it gave us a bad impression of the whole guide idea. I get enough of getting told what to do at work and I go to Canada to have a completely different experience. Schedule- Again, my typical life is scheduled. The only reason I take a watch to Canada is to figure out how long it is to sunset. We are more inclined to come in during the afternoon, have our one substantial meal and be out until dark for the later bite. However, if we are sitting on a hole we like the flexibility of doing what we want. I guess what I am saying is that I agree with Mike's premise. At the same time, I don't have the experience he has. Additionally, I know there are guides who are probably excellent and become part of the team in a short time. They can probably save you hours by identifying productive spots. There is certainly a place for them, but probably not in my boat. Fish On! Hooks"

You arrive, sit down, eat, and can be back fishing in 20-25 minutes. In my 10 years here, there has never been a time where dinner wasn't ready and waiting at 6PM. There's zero wait, there's zero dishes or clean up... there's more fishing time. As far as guides... there are pros out there. I get why there's enjoyment in doing it yourself. However, there can be a lot of fun in being guided too. Meeting new people with new ideas. Different thoughts about fish theory and why they do what they do."
