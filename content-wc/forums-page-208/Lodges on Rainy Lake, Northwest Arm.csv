1567601,mrwalleye5,2013-03-17 20:46:00,1922,Looking for a lodge in this area. Been to Camp Narrows but want to go into a different boat in Lodge. Any suggestions?

1586546,Guest,2013-03-22 11:01:00,0,That why it's lake Despair lodge. Not on Rainy.
1591050,walleyeduran,2013-03-23 19:34:00,286,Does Camp Fire Island throw in a new boat to take home for that price? WOW!!!!!:
1591522,Kevin R,2013-03-24 06:23:00,305,If going for 2 days $1100 per person I thought was an extra digit added by mistake but no that is the price.

1592370,stillangling,2013-03-24 10:25:00,149,"That price includes boat (it is not a tin tippy), guide, bait, meals and lodging. I have no skin in this game but know of the lodge and the quality of the fishing. What is a reasonable cost per night for lodging? Last hotel I checked into was $120.00. A boat like they are running at Campfire (75 hp) is going to suck back at least $50.00 bucks worth of fuel per day. Figure out the depreciation on a 20' Lund with a 75 hp. They do not give them away. What would you expect to pay for 3 meals in a restaurant (and forget the comparison to McDonalds). A starting point for a guide is $150.00 per day. Suddenly $550.00 per day does not sound like they are getting rich. Check out other full service operations like this one. Silver Water Wheel, Totem and Crow Rock are reasonable comparisons. Can I afford to go to these places. Nope but some day I hope to be in a position to put my feet up and watch someone else clean and cook the fish. And by the way, pass me a drink!"
