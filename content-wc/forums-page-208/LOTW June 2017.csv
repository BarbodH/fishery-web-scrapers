5237018,Multispecies Guy,2016-12-23 07:52:00,447,"Ia Walihntr, that's what I deduced from his comments. I like to patronize businesses that treat people well. That's why I will take a serious look at Obabikon for a trip I'm planning for this fall."
5237410,Obabikon,2016-12-23 14:53:00,2370,"Thanks for the kind words guys, but I'm simply suggesting what I think works best for what's needed. If he was looking for an american plan resort or had a large house keeping group... I would probably suggest Obabikon. However, given the limited size of the party, and knowing that Moonlight is a beautiful well kept camp... I have confidence suggesting them. Since we are actual advertisers on the website, I have a little more room to promote our resort than some. I don't really feel this is the place to try to ""hard sell"" people. Just give information as honestly as you can, and be content with the outcome. I am always open to PM's. If you choose any of the resorts in our area, please PM me, and I will happily give suggestions. You can also stop by the resort, and if I'm around... I'll mark up a map for you. Have an awesome trip!"
5230354,Multispecies Guy,2016-12-16 11:37:00,447,"Looking at a trip to LOTW the first week of June, 2017 for two couples. We are primarily targeting SMB but welcome LMB and pike. We also want to catch enough walleyes for shore lunch a couple times. One wife has had a serious leg injury and wants to avoid any resorts with steep slopes or long stairs from cabin to dock. We are on a budget for accommodations of approx $750/person for the week and we need fairly easy access to boat gas. We are looking at Moonlite Bay Lodge, Indianhead Lodge, White Pines Lodge and Moore Bay Lodge. Have eliminated most of the other resorts based on price, location, availability, etc. Anyone have any thoughts on those 4 resorts or the relative quality of the SMB fishing in those areas? Thanks"
5230546,Obabikon,2016-12-16 14:53:00,2370,Meghan and her husband do a fantastic job at Moonlight Bay. I highly recommend them. Very reasonably priced for what all you get too.
5231498,mt hook,2016-12-17 11:10:00,65,OB Said it best. If you can get a June date? Best to send your deposit in now!
5232178,MN_Moose,2016-12-18 08:59:00,964,I suggest you consider Smith Camps near Kenora. If you can get one of the three cabins on the beach there are no hills to climb. Great areas for SMB and you can always catch a few eater walleye. Can't vouch for LMB as we've never caught one up there. http://www.smithcamps.com/

5233802,srk-low,2016-12-20 09:24:00,78,"To be fair to all I will not name the resort, but you may be wise to check if one of your considerations is listed for sale be a local realtor. That would be a concern for me."
5234594,Baseline,2016-12-21 06:24:00,3207,"For fishing on a budget try Vic and Dots located a few miles north of Nestor Falls on the lower end of Whitefish Bay. Excellent smallmouth, largemouth and pike fishing in an uncrowded area of LOW. Cabins are well maintained and nice docks with electric hookups. The new owners are working hard to build a good reputation."
5234738,Multispecies Guy,2016-12-21 07:40:00,447,"Obabikon and mt hook--thanks, I've heard that from several people. MN_Moose--thanks. Will keep that resort in mind. Guest1--thanks, we like the look of Indianhead. srk-low--thanks, maybe we should just buy that resort Baseline--thanks, will give them a look. One other resort popped up as a possibility--Sabaskong Bay Lodge. Not many comments on WC about SBL. Anyone have any insight?"
5234978,Obabikon,2016-12-21 10:24:00,2370,"Grant and family do a very good job at Sabaskong Bay. Just depends on what location you're wanting to fish. I would probably lean moonlight for SMB though. Either way though, it isn't like Cedar Island is THAT far off course. If it were down to those two, I think you're looking at a win/win choice. I don't know enough about the others to give any type of informed decision. -Jared"
5235370,Multispecies Guy,2016-12-21 14:51:00,447,"Obabikon, noticed that you signed your last comment Jared. I assume you own and operate Obabikon Bay Camp. First let me tell you, I appreciate your posts here. You've paid compliments to other resort owners in your general area and haven't tried to steer me to your resort. Plenty of people will bad mouth the competition or try to poach guests. Perhaps the rules that govern your privilege to post here are rather strict but I like how you handle yourself. I'd like to discuss a future trip, do you accept PMs?"
