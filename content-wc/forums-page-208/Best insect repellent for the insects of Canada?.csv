Is it:1) Original Double strength2) Imitation3) PureAll 3 are availabe from their website and I'd sure like to try some - getting tired of 100% deet. Even thought it works great. Just costs a few pair of sunglasses.Our plane leaves on 6/13 and we have a 1,000 mile drive in front of that and I need to give the product time to get here.Thanks,Paul"
1107447,pikepaul,2009-05-23 08:53:00,16,can anyone answer it correctly?

1096416,Mark Komo,2009-04-12 15:23:00,867,The mississippi river crew loves plain vanilla extract. Watsons from Winona seems to be the preferred type. Just rub a little on a few areas. Also here plain lemon based join soap does wonders.
1096512,bpetersen,2009-04-12 23:14:00,251,I have been using vanilla extract for years bow hunting. It works very well and don't have to worry about getting it on the skin or equipment. Much cheaper than the ThermaCELL.
1096516,troutaholic,2009-04-13 02:56:00,827,Mark Komo's thread had mistakenly named the product from Winona.....it is Watkins Vanilla.
1096845,Steve of Madison,2009-04-13 22:12:00,230,"Used REPEL up until last year when I turned on my Therma Cell. Thing worked like a charm, even when the Northern slime got bad. I would have never believed it until I tried it myself. I now have 2, 1 for the wife and 1 for me. Initial investment is not cheap but figure how much you spray on, the stink, the lingering effects, etc."
1097892,elway12,2009-04-17 10:24:00,335,"Hope our results with the Therma cells are the same as yours Steve. Will of course still use Deep woods/Deet products etc. plus clubs, guns, knives, etc"
1098254,Guest,2009-04-19 08:33:00,0,"Deep Woods off!!! By far the best. I guided the Fishn' Canada crew last year (Mike, Pete, and Angelo) and they swore by Muskol (have to when you're sponsored by it), but still I prefer Deep Woods Off! Not that I love Bob Izumi, he's nice enough in person, but really pushes the product when you're fishing with him. Fishin' Canada used whatever works. As a guide, I love it. Go Deep Woods!"
1098325,NickIL,2009-04-19 11:53:00,6,Any suggestions for large dogs (lab) that will be heading into serious skeeter country for the first time?
1098337,rpieske,2009-04-19 12:31:00,1276,You might try spraying a kerchief with Deep Woods and tying it around the neck of the dog.
1098532,Big Tim,2009-04-20 06:58:00,63,I'll have to try this for the flies. 6 years ago I learned (here) about taking vitamin B1 once a day starting 2 weeks before you go. Works for the 'skeeters. It works for me & SOME of my party. Others notice no diff. 7 years and hardly any bites!!
1104539,Faceman,2009-05-12 20:50:00,1,I now swear by the butane things( Thermocell). They work. I won't bore you with the over and over positive but whether in the bottom of a boat or at /underneath the picnic table . We've tried everything else---we live beside a swamp. my two cents
1095263,elway12,2009-04-08 10:26:00,335,Thanks for all of the feedback. I have always known about the Deet but the Permanone looks interesting. The butane pack I have purchased (yet to be used) is the one listed on the following web site. http://mosquitocentral.com/tcell.htm Good point on the gas + butane danger link. I don't think/hope there is an open flame but it is always wise to be safe.
1095375,adempsey,2009-04-08 17:49:00,963,"Deet products work the best for mosquitoes according the the study I linked below. The more Deet the longer the protection. You can get the high % Deet repellent they use in the army at some stores.Fradin MS, Day JF. Comparative efficacy of insect repellents against mosquito bites. N Engl J Med 2002;347:13-8.Following from healthyontario.comThe following suggestions can help you avoid mosquitoes: Use insect repellentAdults: Apply a bug repellent that contains no more than 30% DEET (chemical name N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) to clothes and exposed skin. In general, the duration of protection for various strengths of DEET is approximately 6 hours for 30% 5 hours for 15% 3 hours for 10% 2 hours for 5%Children two to 12 years of age: Use DEET in concentrations of 10% or less and do not apply more than three times daily. Do not apply repellent to the face and hands and avoid prolonged use.Children aged six months to two years: Apply DEET repellent once daily in situations where there is a high risk of complications due to insect bites. In these situations, sparingly use concentrations of less than 10% DEET and do not apply to the face and hands. Avoid prolonged use.Children under six months of age: Do not apply DEET to clothes or skin.Pregnant women: There are no data to suggest that DEET is harmful for pregnant or breast-feeding women. However, these women may want to use non-chemical methods (such as protective clothing and avoiding times and places where mosquitoes are likely to be present)."

1095462,Guest,2009-04-08 22:18:00,0,"Best is to carry a 5 ft length of culvert and a sledge hammer. Crawl into the culvert and when mosquitos bore through it, bend their beaks over with the sledge., trapping them. Don't do over 50 per length of culvert, or they will fly off with you."
1095492,doubleheader,2009-04-09 06:14:00,2652,"For black flies start on garlic pills a week or 2 before your trip, then include proper clothing, light in color as they seem more attracted to the dark colors, and a 100% deet product. Take a head net as back-up. For skeeters deet, proper clothing, head net."

1094632,rpieske,2009-04-06 13:11:00,1276,"In my experience, the best insect repellant is Deep Woods Off. There may be better ones but not readily available. The butane units do work in the boat, especially for the flies. But they work for mosquitos also...as long as it's not windy."
1094640,Obabikon,2009-04-06 13:32:00,2370,I agree... deep woods off is the way to go. Unless you're wanting to use some super expensive stuff... this is the best economic/performance spray.
1094653,Pooch,2009-04-06 14:17:00,4618,"Deet products in general. Don't get the type that are ""perfumed"" up as they really stink. Some rules with Deet IMO are: Don't put it on your skin. Spray it around your ankles on your pants and maybe around your hat or the hat itself. Don't breath the mist or fog of this stuff. DO NOT GET IT ON PLASTIC. It attacks depth finder screens and plastic eye glass lens without mercy. Other than that, it is a great product..........The best way to get away from the ankle biters is to wear light chore boots in the boat. Or at the least something more substantial than a pair of socks! They even bite through the fabric on tennis shoes. High top hiking boots are ok for some folks.Mosquito coils in the cabin is usually a big plus, but when you get home everything will smell like the coils. It's worth it if you've ever tried to go to sleep in a mosquito infested cabin in July! You don't want to read the label on these either.............. I've sort of grown to like the smell of mosquito coils over the years, reminds me of where I'm at or wished I was. Here again, don't buy the ""perfumed"" up coils. They stink worse than the ""perfumed"" up Deet. Actually I prefer the cabin full of mosquitoes to the smell of the ""perfumed"" coils.Pooch"
1094655,Pooch,2009-04-06 14:29:00,4618,"Me again. Couple more thoughts. There's something about having a butane burner in the boat and a plastic fuel tank that makes me really edgy. One of my old fishing partners always smoked a pipe and never shut up. He had the audacity to up and die one winter. Really didn't miss him all that much until I realized he had been keeping the bugs off of us for years. Deet or second hand smoke? hmmmm... Fishing in the narrows with the other camp's two strokes sometimes helps, too. Pooch"
1094664,fishncamp,2009-04-06 14:53:00,49,Deep Woods Off or Muskol work fine....spray it on at the dock and away from your rods and tackle.I also find that when I eat more citrus friut (oranges) and wear light colored clothes the mosquitos are not as bothersome.
1094686,Guest,2009-04-06 15:30:00,0,"If you can find it, the best I have ever used is Amway D-15. Expensive but it is the best by far. Deep Woods would be second."

1094735,Opti-Mist,2009-04-06 18:18:00,1402,"Repel with high Deet content, 27 or thereabouts, works well if I feel the need for a repellent. My FIL used to be really bugged by bugs. Once when we were re-roofing a cabin he was working on the bush side and I was doing the lake side. He was cussing up a storm and I asked him what was getting him into such a lather. He said the mosquitos were relentless. I thanked him for keeping them all on his side because there weren't any on my side. Bugs of all kinds got to him, even as they seemed to let me alone."
1094772,BuckeyeATC,2009-04-06 20:55:00,88,"Anything with Permanone in it works wonders. DO NOT put it on your skin, only have to treat your clothing once every 2 weeks or so. I always spray my hat and my fishing jacket down. The mosquitoes don't come anywhere near me. The stuff has to be good its what the military uses."
