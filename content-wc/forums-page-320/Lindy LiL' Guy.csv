But it is hard to say if they were any better, 'cause we were catching walleyes on just about anything we put in the water. Cabela's sells what looks like a knock off. I bought some but never took them out of the wrapper."

Put my other harnesses on and it was non-stop fishing. I found that at any speed above 1.5 they would turn sideways, drifting them they had a pretty decent action though, the fish just didn't like them I guess."
