This is not due to the abundance of walleye though, but rather due to fisheries not managing this as a walleye fishery. They don't seem to care what happens to the population sadly. So for now you can keep some but they sure are elusive and after fishing a few days for them I finally managed to catch three. There are much better walleye lakes in the province and if you are just after walleye you probably could spend your time better somewhere else. Consider trying near by Moose Lake or Marie Lake that are loaded with walleye and where you can also keep one for the dinner table. If you do go to Cold Lake you will have a lot more fun fishing for the abundant pike and Lake trout that come in very large sizes at this lake. Hope you enjoy the video."

You only have 800 fish bearing lakes in the province. There are 250,000 in Ontario. Guess that is part of the reason we see so many Alberta plates at the boat launches in NW Ontario. We have fish, you have jobs. Now there is some incentive for Alberta to avoid secession from the rest of the country. just hope you guys in the oil patch don't get tired of keeping the rest of the country out of bankruptcy."

We have some good ones but not a whole lot, so there aren't a whole lot of fish to go around for consumption. Some day I'll make it out to Ontario to do some fishing, that would be great. I think we should probably use the oil money to make more fish bearing lakes... haha seems more important than bailing out the rest of the country."
