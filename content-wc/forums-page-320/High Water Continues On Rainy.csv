I don't think the water has made it into the cabins, but the bathrooms in 5 cabins are out of service. Tom mentioned sometting about a possible lodging & fishing deal for clean-up work. Send a note to fishing ""at"" campnarrows.ca if you might be interestred. Hope everyone on Rainy is doing OK. Nimstug"

The high water covered our septic so using the bathroom, or any water for that matter, is out. That's small potatoes compared to some who've lost docks or been flooded out. We did have one volunteer to get on the ark so far. The last pick is from further down the lake. They even have their float plane sandbagged in."
