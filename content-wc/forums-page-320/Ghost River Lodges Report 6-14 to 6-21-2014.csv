2926025,Larry Mac,2014-06-23 08:28:00,530,"Hi WC Friends, We just returned from a fabulous week of fishing GRC. We caught many walleye during the week with the largest @ 27.5"". Many in the 20""+ range we also caught. Largest Northern was 38"". We were fishing Jig and minnow in 10 FOW. We had high numbers everyday except the one sunny bluebird day. The weather was great for walleye fishing as it was overcast/misty/rainy most ever day except one. The temps were 50/60's with wind most everyday. It was a great trip as all had lots of fun. Thank you,Larry Mac"
2926305,Lovetofish,2014-06-23 09:14:00,458,High water and a lot of mosquitoes?
2926369,Carnhzkr,2014-06-23 09:22:00,964,"Thanks for the report, Larry. I took my family to GRL in 2012. We actually stayed with Donny at the Sturgeon River Camp. I was more excited in anticipation of that particular trip than any other, based on all of the overwhelmingly positive reviews and personal recommendations I'd received while researching it. It has everything I'd been looking for to become my #1 go to for the rest of my life camp. The way they boat you in and portage you over the falls and all of the available portage lakes, each with their own personality sounded fantastic, and it was all of that, but we just didn't catch a ton of fish on that trip. The week we were there, the water was way high. All of the docks and the tunnel to Clamshell was under water. Everyone staying at Sturgeon, even veterans that'd been going there for 18 years, were complaining that fishing was the worst they'd seen it. I think we just hit a bad week. I'd like to give it another try sometime. I will say it was the most beautiful lake we've ever fished, with all of the waterfalls and rapids coming into Marchington."
2928521,Larry Mac,2014-06-23 18:09:00,530,"Hi Lovetofish, yes the water was the highest I have ever seen and the mosquitoes were out in force.Thank you,Larry Mac"
2928625,Larry Mac,2014-06-23 18:29:00,530,"Hi Carnhzkr, Yes we also stayed at Sturgeon River with Don but have also stayed at Ghost River (Main Camp) along with their outposts in the past and was very happy with them all. I agree with you on the beauty and variety that Ghost River has to offer. I am sorry to hear that the fishing when you were there was slow. My memory of the spring of 2012 was a mix of extremes from hot to cold combined with the high water. We were at Sturgeon River Camp June 13 through June 23 2012. Like you said the water was extremely high and the tunnel was closed. We had the kids with us (which makes every trip an adventure and great). We were fortunate as the fishing was very good that week. Below are some of the pics from that trip. I too hope you have the opportunity to give Ghost another visit. Have a great year Thank you,Larry Mac"
2930161,Skyraptor,2014-06-24 07:26:00,291,Glad you had a great trip Larry and have to agree about everything you said about the fishing and beauty of staying a GRL or SRC. I still have just over 100 days to go before I go to GRC and can't wait. Did you tie up a moose for me?
2932889,Larry Mac,2014-06-24 19:03:00,530,"Hi Tom, We did see several moose. Don is looking forward to see you this fallThank youLarry mac"
