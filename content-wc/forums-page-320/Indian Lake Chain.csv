2945105,IAWally,2014-06-28 07:16:00,38,I usually go up first week of June. We stay at KCs landing. We have caught bass at Bills Island and the two Islands in front of KCs. The moose creek sanctuary is closed while we are there but there is a long rock reef that has always looked like it would be good for bass.
