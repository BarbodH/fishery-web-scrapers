2940817,heritage2008,2014-06-26 20:01:00,92,Have been using the 407 for some time. Friends of ours just came back from North Bay from Ohio and said they made better time not taking the ETR. What say you travelers? From past experiences it seems better to just use it coming south because of the 403 jambs. David
2941145,ohiojmj,2014-06-26 21:15:00,1262,"Towing a boat on 407 from QEW to 400 is very pricey. We pass through that area around 6 am on a Saturday enroute and take the non-toll route QEW-403-401-400. Traffic not terrible, but if one of 6 billion cars goes clunk, you have a mess anywhere in Toronto area. Check the rates. http://www.407etr.com/highway/map.html From QEW to 400, I'm calculating $39.82 (SUV and trailer = single heavy vehicle) and then there are fees. I skip the rip-off on principle....."
2941385,adempsey,2014-06-27 04:38:00,963,"Its always better to take the 407. The real question is it worth it to you ? I always take it, but i live there and have a transponder."
2941425,alberta bum,2014-06-27 05:01:00,312,Funny this came up.. I'm heading to timmins from windsor either tonight or early morning.. I'm really dreading this area right now.. I can imagine the zoo I'm about to encounter.
2941489,northernbite,2014-06-27 05:19:00,1186,"Question for me is have you traveled 407? Have you been billed? Not trying to start something just curious, I've been going up their 30 years and started using 407 as soon as each section opened and have not received a bill. If I do get billed I still intend to run this route.Just wondering,Paul"
2941521,Whopper,2014-06-27 05:31:00,340,"Yep, I traveled it a few times and received a bill from them in the mail. As I recall they have only missed one of my trips through there and yes it's a little pricey while towing a boat but I just chalk it up and move on."
2941961,Seanik,2014-06-27 07:29:00,218,"Paul, The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania refuses to release it's license plate data base to Ontario and the 407 officials, therefore they have no way of knowing where to send the bills. The refusal goes back a few years when NAFTA started and Pa wanted to bill Ontario trucks for using some of the roadways, Ontario & Pa butted heads and hence the refusal. Most other states exchange the license data with Ontario. Seanik"
2942241,northernbite,2014-06-27 08:19:00,1186,"Ah that explains it. I didn't know why but though I should not question because I was not getting billed. I'm sure they will work this so that ""we all can pay"". As I said I like going that way. Paul"
2942649,Wawajake,2014-06-27 10:14:00,413,"If you can avoid it !! You should not want to use the 401 for any reason between the hours of 6 am and 7 pm on every day except Sunday. It will become a parking lot randomly thruout the length of it., and some crazy drivers cutting in and out to make matters worse. I strongly suggest you use the 407 etr and avoid the mess .......oh and also during summers on Friday afternoons and nights you will have traffic all heading to cottages on 401 and then traffic jambs all the way up Highway 400, and the reverse coming back on Sunday evenings."
2942993,polaris-pete,2014-06-27 11:45:00,343,"I have been using the 407 since the day they first opened it.Back awhile ago we never got billed but as technology caught up so did their billing. Yes its expensive but so are my fishing and snowmobiling trips. If you have ever had the pleasant experience of sitting on the QEW, the 405, 403, 401 waiting to get on the 400 when theres an accident or just volume of trafffic, the monies paid to use the 407 are well justified in my eyes.BTW I was on a trip 3 weeks ago and got my 407 bill yesterday. $56 roundtrip."
