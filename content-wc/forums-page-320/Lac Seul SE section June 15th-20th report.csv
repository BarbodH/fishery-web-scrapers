We fished the SE section of Lac Seul June 15th-20th from the lower Z to Thorsten creek and all around Sen Bay.Fishing was slower than normal for us and big fish were hard to find. Mosquitos were terrible in the evening when the winds calmed down. Nosee-um knats werent and issue. But, there were so many catapillars (army worms) I think than I can ever remember. They were so thick that the road to deception launch was black with squished army worms. The bow/keel of the boats were covered with their carcasses. They were everywhere. Falling on you from the trees, crawling up you.... at any given time you had atleast one of those nast buggers crawling on you.First day was heavy rain and wind. Bad enough to get off the lake early. 2nd and 3rd day was cloudy/windy. 4th day was sunny and calm. 5th day was more rain and wind. 6th day was cloudy and windy again. Water level was probably 3 feet higher than normal. This years trip produced many slot fish which made it difficult to find keepers to eat and bring back. We either found a tremendous amount of action on dinky walleye 12-14"" and 20"" pike or found the slot fish. We always go the same week each year and hit all of our normal favorite spots. Where we normally do very well in the 13-18 foot range for walleye they were sporadic and small. We ended up going deeper. 25-30 feet was producing lots of slot walleye and eaters (finally) lol. Weed beds were harder to find I think due to the high water level. We like to find cabbage for pikes but it was tough to find and when we did find some they were very small beds. None reached the surface. We did a lot of running and gunning. It was tough trying to find fish schooled up. We did find one spot that has heavy current flow in a neck down area where we killed pike and walley jigging in 30-ish feet of water. I remembered to take some screen shots.walleye: jig/minnow had good results yellows/pinks, orange. Lipless cranks blue/chrome, fire tiger, red/chartruese combo's. We were also getting walleyes on spoons red/white, 5 of diamonds. jigging required more presentation popping/movements but the cranks and spoons retrieve had to be slowed down. We noticed that counting down somewhat before starting the retrieve helped. We figured it out by accident due to the high winds and trying to control the boat that not starting the retrieve right away seemed better. Slow trolling or no action vertical jigging didnt fare well. Biggest walleye was only 24"" Usually we get closer to the 26-28"" range for biggest walleye each year.Pike: Same spoons mentioned above, bucktails/mepps orange/black or black, and they were taking the easy route and hitting jig/minnows too. Biggest pike was 35-ish. Usually we get a half dozen over 40. This year it was the year for slot pike. lots in the 28-30 range.All in all the trip went well. No damaged props or boats. Border crossing at Fort Francis was smooth/quick. Happy fishing!Brian"

Personally its has been a tougher year but I do like your run and gun commentary. Having to think it out and try different tactics makes the experience that much more memorable, especially for familiar waters. Nothing like having to adapt to succeed to make the day even better.Cheers,"
2932449,new hips,2014-06-24 16:48:00,498,Sounds like tough weather.......Thanks for the report
2932721,rnnonmt,2014-06-24 18:10:00,992,"Another comment. Lock up your minnow buckets or zip tye them closed when you put your minnows at the dock overnight. One of the boats in our group had their minnows stolen. Presumably from an otter. The minnow buckets with the ""push in flap"" are easy pickins for the otters. Luckily mine werent swiped. I have the round bucket style with the lock you have to turn and then lift the lid. I was fortunate. Minnows arent cheap at 5 or 6 bucks a dozen."
2933057,CMesserschmidt,2014-06-24 19:49:00,1006,Army worms for bait been tried yet?
2933089,rnnonmt,2014-06-24 19:58:00,992,"We didnt try them. I must have casted, jigged, trolled.... you name it. Where ever there were army worms along the shores edge... you werent going to get a hunger bite. You might get a reaction bite."
2937289,Ranger NB,2014-06-25 18:53:00,15,"Next year will really be a zinger for army worms. In a lot of the area the relatively few worms that are around, are laying eggs for next year's hatch. There are isolated cases in some areas this year, wait until next. If you have not seen a full blown army worm infestation, it will be a treat. Thank goodness this only happens every other blue moon."
