First, since we generally cast for pike and prob average between 50-60 a day I like to set up my ""operating"" area in the back of the boat. I take off about 90 percent of all fish caught in our boat. First year i think i lost four spreaders and two long handled fish unhookers!! Tried to buy floatable ones but still had to do tricks to reclaim them. Now i use those casino type stretchy bungy cords and everything gets attached to the boat in a very handy way. Havent lost one since and my dad says im the best pike oral surgeon there is!!! 2nd is as simple as cornhuskers lotion. Does wonders on the tons of small knicks and tooth gashes i get each year, hey and it smells good!! Good luck"

I keep some extra trailer light bulbs and fuses in the boat also. A few good lengths of rope is good to stow somewhere on board. Take a wire style bottom bouncer regardless of if you use them to fish; they can clear a clog on any outboard motors tell-tale. X2 on zip ties, electrical tape, multi-tool, and headlamp."

Bug spray, Ben's 100% deet in the little orange bottle or off! Deep woods as high level deet as you can find. A hatchet and a lighter, building a campfire if it's cold and rainy can really lift the spirits especially if you have kids or the fish have stuck their noses in the mud as my dad always says."
