2931265,1-shot,2014-06-24 11:38:00,35,"Returned this past weekend from our first trip to Lac Dumoine in Quebec, (june 13 thru June 20). Our group of eight stayed at Dumoine Lake Cottages. The accomodations were very clean but a bit small for our group of 8. We really liked the setup where all of the cabins are set very far apart from the other cottages on the lake (at least a mile between cottages which gives an outpost feel). The boats were adequate and the motors were in great condition.The fishing was very good. Each person in our group caught their fair share of both walleye and pike. Largest walleye 25.5"", largest pike 37.5"". Fished 50% of the time using jigs tipped with crawlers, twister tails or leeches and the other 50% of the time trolling f-11's, husky jerks, and shad raps. This was our first time on this body of water and considering this, we were very satsfied with the quality of the fishing. The ride in to the camp was a 3 1/2 hour drive down a dirt road which can be a bit challenging in some areas but still manageable. I would definitly recomend this camp for anyone interested in a very secluded nice lake to spend a week in Canada.On a side note, the bugs were pretty bad this year. 1-shot"
