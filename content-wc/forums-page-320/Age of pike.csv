It was 42"" caught from Melchett Lake Ontario on a jig, twister tail, and no leader. Released fish to get bigger. My old mind started asking just how old might this fish be. Contacted Ministry in Ontario and they came back the following. A 42"" pike caught in lakes North of Nakina would be approximate 14 years old. If lake has lake trout then the pike would grow faster."

2923873,onetimedave,2014-06-22 14:42:00,502,"Definitely release large fish. If you must have a wall hanger. Photo, measure and get a replica."

Caught the second biggest northern of my life on my trip to Northern Ontario two weeks ago. 39 3/4""! Fought like crazy. I just couldn't seem to stretch it to a 40""! My only northern above 40"" was a 44"" back in 2002! What a fish. BTW, both were released. I hope my kids/grandkids get a shot at them!"
