This picture is from Sioux Lookout. Look at the boat garages and the water level at the doors. Fishing produced enough to eat and take a few home. Saw more moose around the roads this trip than in the last sixteen years. Just a guess, but makes me wonder if some of the drier ground is near the roads. Drivers beware!"
2932657,rnnonmt,2014-06-24 17:58:00,992,That is the Frog Rapids docks. We go passed there every day launching at deception. There is actually a boat in the closest garage. Amazing how high the water is. We cross under the loon rapids bridge every day with the boats heading into lac seul. You can visibly see a change in water height crossing through there. It is running fast.

2936817,rnnonmt,2014-06-25 16:35:00,992,We were down in Bindo lake one day and tried to get under the railroad crossing bridge at the far east end and couldnt make it. If I had a tiller boat with no console we could have done it but I have a full windshield walk thru boat. I let the 17 foot full windshield alumacraft try to go first. When they didnt make it I knew I wasnt going to. It wasnt gonna happen in my 19 footer.
