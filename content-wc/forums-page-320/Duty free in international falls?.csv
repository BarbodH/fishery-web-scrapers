2939761,Wallii1,2014-06-26 15:02:00,37,Beer is Canadian at the duty free. $15-20 a case. Duty is around 9.00 a case over the 1 you are allowed free. You do save money buying it there.
2940569,MorganMan,2014-06-26 18:53:00,341,"Duty free is a crock of S#@&%! Buy it wherever is convenient for you to pack. We get in states and take because of the volume and weight, packing is more important. Somebody show us what duty free truly means? Nothing is duty/tax free that I have seen."
2933337,Roddy,2014-06-24 20:55:00,488,Is there a duty free liquor store at international falls crossing? Heading up July 4th. What is the price per case at these stores? My outfitter wants about $40 per case to fly them in before we arrive
2933497,BB3,2014-06-24 21:39:00,48,Yes there is. It is on the left as you are heading towards the bridge. I think $18-$20 a case.Sent from my SCH-I545 using Tapatalk

Normally you are only allowed so many pounds per person. The outfitter that I know charges $50 a case to buy it from them, then to fly it in. If you buy it at the duty free store, you are only allowed so many. I do not know that count."
2933553,SinOrSwim,2014-06-24 22:17:00,1528,Maybe I'm mistaken but I don't think you can buy beer on the US side and not pay a duty on it when you cross? Especially if it is only $20/case?
2933609,1jigfish2,2014-06-24 22:38:00,110,"Every adult can cross with one case of beer, or one litre/quart of booze, with no duty charged. I do not know if the rules are different if you purchase at duty free store."
2933881,Skywagon,2014-06-25 05:37:00,1106,"You may buy at the duty free store (it is on the left just before if you cross the border). You will be allowed one case per person duty free when you cross into Canada, you will pay duty on every case after the first one (at Canada Customs)."
2933921,Richard B,2014-06-25 05:51:00,735,Does that include icing them down also? If so that would not be all that bad. A nice cold beer as soon as you got off the plane and are unpacking your gear and you don't have to worry about being over weight and paying even move. Sounds great!
2934049,Guest,2014-06-25 06:33:00,0,I stop at IF twice a year at the duty free. Prices are good. You are still allowed the same amount of liquor no matter where you buy it. We like the fact that we just give them our receipt from the duty free when we go through customs. Price examples: 2 Crown for $35; case Labatt's Light--$18. The last three times through the border they haven't charged us duty even though we were over our limit. I don't know why.
2934961,phidelt157,2014-06-25 09:56:00,191,Is the beer at duty free real Canadian beer or the American version?
2937065,NARDA 1,2014-06-25 17:33:00,636,"Duty Free Americas 218-283-2556 is on the left just before the stop sign before you cross the railroad tracks, you can also gas up there."
