I figured it was time we go take a look for ourselves and see what all the fuss was about. Well we weren't disappointed but we didn't catch any as big as some people were leading us to believe. I have a suspicion that people are over estimating there catches weight as these 4 to 6 pound walleye are so fat and look big. We had steady action all day fishing crankbaits and bottom bouncers in different areas of the lake near sharp drop offs. We will be back! This lake is a great Fish and Wildlife story. The lake had been fished out of walleye in the 80's, cormarants and pelicans overtook the lake and a huge population of stunted perch ruled the large body of water. The fish and wildlife took into their hands and drastically reduced the bird population and started stocking millions of walleye a year. Now people are catching consistent large walleye up over 10 pounds. We didn't get any that big but we had consistent 4-6 pound walleye coming into the boat. Supposedly the perch are now a lot bigger as well. Anyways here is the link if you are interested. Here's the video Link - the fish get bigger as the video goes on when we changed locations.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Adoqt5yT-k Here is a fail video of mine from last summer was fishing in the mountains and my gopro fell over into the water, you can see my reaction and the camera hit the drink.
