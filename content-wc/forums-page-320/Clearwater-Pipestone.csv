We always just jig/lindy rig deep weed/sand grass edges and reef drop offs and have decent success. I know we can do better. Stocked up on different crank baits shad raps, flicker shads, etc. and bottom bouncer/spinner rigs. Wanting to cast the crank baits at wind blown shorelines and pull the bouncers and spinners in similar areas we jig to cover more water. Also want to try slip bobbers on reef tops at dusk. Bought some lighted ones. Does anyone have any info and or advice on some of the tactics i want to try? We fish the 7/5-7/12 week. I figure typically the fish should be on the main lake humps by then but things are running a few weeks behind this year. Any tips are appreciated."
