2942337,Whopper,2014-06-27 08:37:00,340,So.....which spot is mine? I surely haven't fished a spot of LV that you haven't and I probably haven't put a dent in all of your spots
2942353,Whopper,2014-06-27 08:40:00,340,Nah GE won't kill ya and I have found sharing a boat with him a rewarding experience
2942697,labsrus,2014-06-27 10:28:00,557,Another thing we do We bet a dollar for the largest fish each week. Every one signs the dollar and we take a handfull of pictures just before the return trip home. The dollars and the pictures goes up on the bragging board in the boat house. Lot of fun.
2943369,btmbncr,2014-06-27 13:29:00,492,When we get in the truck to leave for our fishing trip to Canada I take my wristwatch off and hang it on the turn signal arm.My father always did this and I have continued this tradition. We also throw back the first walleye caught on the trip.He'll go back and tell the others it's OK to eat the baits as your going to get let go.Bill
2943377,LOW1,2014-06-27 13:31:00,2828,"We almost always are travelling with our kids. I take a five dollar Canadian bill (must be Canadian) and affix it to visor of truck. The first person to spot a live chicken on the trip north gets the money. Leaving tomorrow for the second trip of the year. Taking two or three of the kids, who do not yet know that on my trip north four weeks ago I scouted out the likely chicken hiding spots along the road."
2937241,Golden Eagle,2014-06-25 18:43:00,2642,Eleven people I've taken fishing on Little Vermilion Lake have died. Every season I take time to fish each of their favorite spots. It brings back great memories.
2937465,MorganMan,2014-06-25 19:51:00,341,"Now that brings it all into perspective. Certainly a sign of respect Goldeneagle, I'm sure they appreciate! I hope my group doesn't do that, as I have given them ALL way to much work to do over the years with all the spots I have shown them with my ability to catch fish!"
2938905,Bakefish,2014-06-26 09:50:00,1077,Note to self:Do not go on a trip with Golden Eagle.
2938953,SinOrSwim,2014-06-26 09:59:00,1528,"LOLOLOL I have to admit when I first read that, I thought 11 people died ON THE TRIP over the years. I was like..........What the............ LOL"
2939185,gmattbruin,2014-06-26 11:04:00,174,"our trips are always 7 day ventures. One main tradition tht we nvr do without is 4 bottles of Caribou. A great concoction put together only in Quebec during Winter Carnival. !st bottle goes upon our safe arrival in camp,2nd bottle during our 1st fish meal, 3rd is our 1st shore lunch and the 4th and last is on the last night! We purposely dont take anymore, and im sure anyone from Quebec can attest...thts probably a good thing,LOL"
2939393,Golden Eagle,2014-06-26 12:02:00,2642,Not to worry. I've been putting together trips for 55 years and have taken a lot of old timers. Deceased were all over 70 and many well up in their 80s. Sharing my boat with so many good people has been a rewarding experience for me.
2939545,Bakefish,2014-06-26 13:25:00,1077,Lost a lot of folks in our group over the years also GE. Just swinging at a softball over the plate.
2940649,MorganMan,2014-06-26 19:19:00,341,"All kidding aside, that is impressive and commendable. A lot of memories I'm sure."
2941937,SinOrSwim,2014-06-27 07:21:00,1528,"That is very cool. Not that they died but that you all honor them by fishing their favorite spots. I can hear my group now after I die. They will go fishing in my spots, wont' catch anything and they will grumble.........well that SOB never knew where to fish anyway. LOL"
2942281,Golden Eagle,2014-06-27 08:29:00,2642,I'm really doing it for myself as I fish the favorite spot of each of the deceased because I usually catch fish on their spot and it allows time to relax and reminisce about experiences with great friends. Fishing can be more rewarding than catching.
2935033,labsrus,2014-06-25 10:09:00,557,"Wondering if anyone does anything each trip to Canada to celebrate the trip, remember lost fishing partners or hunting dogs. The trip up to the lake takes 5 hours from my house. Leave after skipping out of work a little early Get to lake near dark, put boat in water and tie it off, unload truck into cabin. Take a nice bottle of bourbon down to the lake with my buddy and our wives to sit on the dock and watch the stars. If it is raining there is the boat house where we can get out of the weather. Most years we take Makers Mark, this year I am taking a bottle of Knob Creek. Been doing this for more years than I can remember. Amazing how the bottle will just evaporate. Another thing that I do is make fishing rods. Have made one for all of my kids, their girlfriend or boyfriend. Usually do not let them see it until we are out on the water. This year I plan to have a nice one ready for my buddy who I have know since high school, close to forty years."
2935481,new hips,2014-06-25 11:35:00,498,"One tradition we had was sitting around the campfire, and locating 3 satellites before going to bed."
2935665,tooski,2014-06-25 12:15:00,393,"Labs, should have stayed with the Makers...."
2935801,Larbo,2014-06-25 12:36:00,231,We have a tree at the lake where musky lures that need to be retired are hung like christmas decorations... Their are over 25 years worth of lures hanging from that tree now. We love to sit on the deck with a adult beverage and talk about the ornaments...
2935841,jimirjr,2014-06-25 12:41:00,1149,"When We pick up Our Houseboat, after about 1/2 hour into trip, We all grab a beer, I open a can of smoked oysters, put em on crackers with cheese, and we eat em all up... Nice residual aroma left over..."
2936201,MrSimon,2014-06-25 14:23:00,922,"Once we arrive at the lake, we usually jump out of the truck and scatter to various trees to take a leak. I suppose that's a tradition."
2936353,thyme to fish,2014-06-25 15:01:00,307,"every trip to my cabin in Wisconsin,,,,,the night before I leave,,,,,a good non-alcohol beer (don't ask) and a righteous cigar on the end of the pier"
2936425,big popi,2014-06-25 15:16:00,635,"There are a couple things I do now. First to have Neil Young's ""Bound for Glory"" once I get on the Trans-Canada highway. Second is when everything is unpacked have to jump off the end of the dock, VERY refreshing!"
2936505,Danbear,2014-06-25 15:27:00,72,Our last stop before heading to camp is the beer stop after that we head to camp and as soon as we turn off the paved road we all crack open a cold Labatts and drink them on the way in. It just seems so right breaking the law once a year.
2937153,HeHooksHimself,2014-06-25 18:03:00,725,"My best fishing partner, my BIL Doc and I have been doing this since we used to hike the Rockies as young men. It used to involve dunking our heads in the stream or lake, but now we skip that part most of the time. A swee holee involves removing your hat, dunking your head (or not) and then shaking your head while loudly voicing the sound of ""swee holeee"". For us it means shaking off the civilization when you arrive at what you consider the wilderness. It means we are officially ""there."""
