2942257,Sportdog,2014-06-27 08:23:00,6735,I bought a 10 pound bag of red potatoes in Canada and have 9 pounds left. Am I allowed to bring them back to the states? Thanks.
2942601,ftfarms,2014-06-27 10:09:00,444,Yes you can. It's Canada at one time didn't want us to bring them because of the dirt that may have been left on them.
2942625,Sportdog,2014-06-27 10:13:00,6735,Thank You. Much appreciated!!!

So when asked if you are bringing anything back from Canada, just declare the potatoes."
