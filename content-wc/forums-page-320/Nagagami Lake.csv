2832753,adempsey,2014-05-25 21:32:00,963,"Spent a week on Nagagami in the early summer of 2012. We stayed at Expeditions North.The southern part of the lake is a fairly deep basin with some nice structure for walleye fishing, while the northern side has more shallow areas and most of the islands on the lake. We caught plenty of nice 18""+ Walleye there. Never targeted pike or perch too much. I think there is better pike fishing on the north end where I believe there are weed beds.For us, the best locations were sharp drop-offs going from 15 feet to 40 feet. Always caught fish when we found this structure. The lake did get rough a couple of days, but it wasn't so bad that we couldn't fish every day. Although, I'd imagine that it could get pretty bad if you get some persistent wind since it's basically a wide open basin with little protection.There are four lodges on the lake, one at the north end down the bay and three at the southwest end. I believe they are all decent camps. Some of them have American Plan.I have heard great things about Kay Vee Lodge and I can personally say that Expeditions North was a top notch camp for accommodations and equipment. David was a great host as well. I haven't heard too much about Timberwolf or Pullen's, but what I've read seems good.I don't think you'll be disappointed with a trip to Nagagami.edit: One other consideration would be Buck Lake. They also fly out of Hornepayne and the quality of fish is similar. Although, we did much better with perch on Buck lake. We stayed at Buck Lake Wilderness Lodges and Outposts, which operates the two camps on the lake. I wouldn't hesitate going back to either of these places."

If I'm flying for pike and walleye, this is the ONLY place I will go for so many reasons. Take care, Ruddiger"
2905681,buckeyedan,2014-06-17 06:45:00,44,"In a word, Nagagami lake is awesome. I've been going there for the past 30 years, and the fishing just keeps getting better. Last year we caught so many big walleye it's hard to believe. One guy in our party got a 30 incher, and there were numerous 25""+ walleye caught during our 4 day trip. We stay at Walton's Kay Vee lodge. I highly recommend them...they are a top notch operation, but as ADempsey said I've heard good things about all of the camps and I don't think you can go wrong. You can catch some huge pike it you want to. I have a 40"" on my wall from a few years back, but we mainly target walleye. Perch can be had as well...on rough weather days we hit the rivers and can usually pick up a few. Overall, I can't recommend Nagagami enough. We fly in on June 28. I've been super busy lately so I haven't had much time to think about it, but it's getting close enough now that I'm getting excited..."
2926633,longline,2014-06-23 10:39:00,5,"Thanks for the input. Heading up there in a few weeks. Would really appreciate any fishing reports for this year. Looking forward to the adventure and hooking into some perch, pike and walleye."
2928913,Mich_Fisherman,2014-06-23 19:57:00,292,"This is probably a good time for this year's Nagagami trip report. We were at Lake Nagagami June 6 through June 13. This was our sixth straight year there and we've booked again for next year. Water temperature was behind last year (no surprise with the late ice out). When we got there it was 55 deg and when we left it was 62 deg. Nevertheless, the fishing was once again outstanding. Often we had a difficult time catching eater fish under 18"" for dinner. We caught many fish from 25"" to 30.5"" (big fish for the week). For the most part, we had much of the lake to ourselves. We were fishing for Walleye with bonus pike and whitefish on occasion. We fished the 15-30' drop offs and caught fish, fished river mouths (rivers were closed until mid June) and caught fish. Mainly jigged with jigs and minnows. As David Zuhl (camp owner Expeditions North) proudly claims, the lake is polluted with Walleye; and he is right!!!We stayed for the sixth straight year at Expeditions North (housekeeping plan only which is ideal for our group) and it was another terrific year for accommodations, equipment and customer service. David ""gets it"" for customer satisfaction and goes the extra mile to make things and do things ""right"". There was a mid week fish fry that they host where dinner is left to the David and his team for main course and sides and we brought another side to pass. Our group is counting the days til next year's trip back to Expeditions. A few of pictures from this year's trip!!!https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...p?albumid=2873"
2930025,Behle,2014-06-24 06:59:00,51,Our group were in camp from 13th to the 20th. Weather was good with a couple of windy days. Fished both the Foch and Buck rivers and found many fish there most in the eater range with a some big ones (26 and several around 22 inches) thrown in. Caught several large fish around Twin Island on the break around 15 feet of water. 29 was largest for the week with probably 20 fish above 24 inches for our group of 5. Eaters were plenty as well. Lots of skeeters this year and black flies were just becoming a problem. Behle
2931065,Seanik,2014-06-24 10:39:00,218,"Our group of 6 will be at Kay Vee Lodge for the 4th year week of July 19th. We always opt for the meal plan. Superb food & cabins, excellent staff that takes great care of us. The walleye bite was off last year during the mayfly hatch but we still had great fishing. The sunken island that comes up to about 9 feet and drops to 25' was always a hot spot. Seanik"
2937361,NickDalasio,2014-06-25 19:26:00,34,"Seanik- I'll just be leaving as you're pulling in, my son & I are headed to Kay Vee the week of July 12th. First time at this lake, and I'm excited!! Any particular color plugs that are working best this year??"
2937721,Seanik,2014-06-25 21:31:00,218,"Hi Nick, We troll mostly worm harnesses until we locate fish, jigs tipped with minnows or a piece of crawler fished straight down usually is all that is necessary to make your arm tired of catching and releasing. When we sometimes troll with plugs the absolute best color is red followed by gold. One member of our group only uses a bare hook with a crawler and a 1/2 oz bullet slip sinker for trolling or over the side and does as well or better than anyone. We may meet between the fly ins/outs, just look for the old guys. Good Luck to you, Seanik"
