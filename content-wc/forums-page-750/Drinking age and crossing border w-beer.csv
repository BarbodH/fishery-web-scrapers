549336,Guest,2005-06-15 16:05:00,0,"If the drinking age in Ontario is 20, can a 20 year old bring a case of beer across into Canada if he's with a group of older guys? Just wondered since its 21 in Minnesota."
549337,Guest,2005-06-15 16:14:00,0,I believe the drinking age in ON is 19. I don't think a 19 or 20 year old should have any problems getting it across. My younger brother did this and we never had to pay duty.
549351,jake,2005-06-15 21:17:00,1694,stop at the annex on your way over. best prices and no problems with under age transport or duties. when we lose the 2nd. amendment the others will be history too!

549370,515,2005-06-16 07:10:00,254,Yup legal age is 19 here and you can bring 2 cases of beer per person across the border or one 40 oz bottle. Anything more then that you have to pay duty on. Good Luck Mike
549371,Guest,2005-06-16 07:12:00,0,"Ontario drinking age is 19, Manitoba the drinking age is 18. You will have no problem bringing booze over the border, but you would only be able to purchase it from the duty free shop just before you cross the border. If all else fails, once you cross just stop at a beer store and pick up a case. Canadian beer tastes alot better and is stronger! same goes for our weed! great drunk and catch fish!!!"
549376,tjsker,2005-06-16 07:51:00,301,"What do you consider a ""case""? 24 (12oz) cans or 12 (12oz) cans? I checked the regs and they say 24 - (355ml) tins. 355mls = about 12 ounces."
549377,wooglin,2005-06-16 08:15:00,371,"We cross the border with 30 packs of beer. We'll be stopping at the Duty Free stations for any additional liquor/beer if needed. Last year, we crossed with too much, we paid duty, that was nearly $40-$50. I suggest taking the max, then stopping in Canada, eh, to get the rest."
549392,Guest,2005-06-16 16:00:00,0,Thanks for the information...Looks like we'd be fine with bringing a case along for the 20 year old in the group. Everything else we'll buy at the resort...LABATT'S baby! PS to AB.. How was fishing on Wabby for you last week?
549430,AB,2005-06-17 22:56:00,61,"The bite was on and off with the coolfront. Found numbers in the weeds and quality out at 21-28. I'd rather go my usual time in July but you've gotta make hay when the sunshines. My wife's due in mid July so that's out for this year. Poor, poor planning on my part! LOL."
