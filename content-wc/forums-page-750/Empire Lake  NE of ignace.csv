549540,Guest,2005-06-21 08:51:00,0,Looking for someone who has fished this lake in the past. (it is actually about staight north of Upsula) It is a remote lake with a drive to outpost cabin to stay in. I will be taking my 2 boys and would like to make this a good experience for them as they have never been to Canada in the past. I have fished other areas before and know I could take them to these lakes and catch fish but it comes with some drawbacks. Any info would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! Gomer
