In all fairness to the other two- do you guys have any advice on scoring a big eye (or a bunch of good eaters) for a couple of good old boys from Wisconsin? Any and all info is greatly appreciated! Thanks, Poke"

It can get really difficult when folks in the same boat are interested in concentraining on that different of species at the same time. Although not completely impracticable, it may turn out that neither is being served very well. If like partners cannot be assigned to the same boat, perhaps taking turns on the targeted species can give each person a shot at their main interest fish. Have fun,"

I caught a 28, 36 and 41 inch muskie on a gold 2"" silver minnow. Wallies were all in the 18 - 26 inch range. Wallies were 15-20' off the points and the muskies were off the shore. Have a great time, it was our best fishing experience in 5 years."

549485,Guest,2005-06-20 12:35:00,0,We will be fishing the Northwest Angle. Staying at Angle Outpost Lodge.
549528,Guest,2005-06-21 07:04:00,0,"I don't think your guy will have much trouble in the NW Angle. I fished out of Monument Bay in '03, and we saw plenty of fish everyday. There will be lots of good information right there in camp. The first week of July, I would expect there to be plenty of fish on the rocky shorelines and reefs throughout the Angle, and during a warming trend pretty aggressive. Don't make it too complicated. Mepps musky killers in black with silver blades and top raiders would probably be my 1, 2 punch. After a front moves through and the wind shifts to N/NW/NE, I would probably go with a spinnerbait in the small weed pockets and/or an 8"" Jake banged off the rocks. If your friend isn't finding the fish out on the rocks, a suick in the weeds can be a killer. I would also fish the windy side of the islands, reefs, points, etc., as a way of narrowing down all the structure. It doesn't always work, but it can help. Good luck."
