We had trouble finding the 16-17 inch eaters for supper. But a word of warning--the bugs were terrible. We are used to mosquitoes, but the black flies were terrible in the afternoon and the no-see-ums would go right through the screens without slowing down. We just spent most of our time on the lake and stayed away from camp. It was still a great trip. Just plan accordingly."

This could be used to explain the bugs, but there were bugs everywhere. If you got out of your truck along the highway, you were immediately swarmed. The locals told us that despite all the rain, the water level has not gone too high this spring."
