549455,Guest,2005-06-19 14:29:00,0,We are taking my grandaughter and her friend who ar 17 years old and non residents. We will get permission slips from both parents to take them to Ontario. Can they both fish with me without purchasing a fishing license. I thought a few years ago they would have to purchase license if they were 16 years old. Someone told me they would have to be 18 to purchase a license.

Non-residents 18 years of age and over must purchase a fishing license. ... Non-residents under 18 yrs of age may fish without a license if accompanied by an adult who has a valid Ontario fishing license. Any fish caught are part of catch and possesion limit of the adult who owns the license. ... Any non-resident under 18 years old may purchase a license and any fish caught apply to that license.
