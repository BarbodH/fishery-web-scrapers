549429,Guest,2005-06-17 22:04:00,0,"I am looking for some help in finding a another resort. My group has been spoiled on a lodge that we have been going to in that it was a boat-in lake which allowed my group to bring in large amounts of supplies (mostly beer). The fishing for walleye has always been outstanding. We have averaged around 30 - 60 walleye per day per person. Most in the 18-26 inch range. In fact, we easily could run the numbers up much higher, but we enjoy the search for new schools. The lodge never made us have our boats in at dark. We could stay out all night if we like, but typically we might stay out a few hours past sundown. The lake had no road access and only 2 lodges on a large lake. So it isn't crowded fishing at all. The lake is easy to fish and we don't have to travel 10 miles to get to the fish if we don't want to. I'm sure some people will not like to hear this, but we do like to drink in the boat. We never has issue drinking but a 12 pack over 12 hours is common. Essentially, we are looking for some new water, but want a lodge and lake that would provide us with the same features. We have a fun group of guys that are easy going and not high maintenance. Our current lake is a walleye/northern lake. Adding lake trout and smallies would be a plus. We also do not want to be worried about getting fines for beer in the boat. The more remote of a lake the better, no summer cabins or public landings preferred. Any thoughts?"

Only resort on a 5 lake system plus the opportunities to go to Wabaskang, Annishinabi, and 2 other lakes. We fish for walleye, pike, lakers, and smallies. Take a look at the website at www.winelakecamp.com. Any other questions please post. Shoe89"
549439,sarg,2005-06-18 12:30:00,29,KROK Would you mind telling me what lake your group has been fishing?Sounds like something I would like to try. One spot that you might try is Lake St. Joseph that is located north of Ignace on Hwy 599. Great fishing on a big lake with very limited access. They have a quota on how many can fish it each year.

549442,Guest,2005-06-18 15:30:00,0,I would also be very interested in finding out which lake you presently fish with such great success. It sounds too good to be true and probably is.
