549189,Guest,2005-06-13 21:47:00,0,Has anyone been fishing Minnitaki yet this season. Any info appreciated. Thanks
549333,Guest,2005-06-15 15:32:00,0,"We fished it last week and did ok. Numbers were good but we did much better in lac sel in the size department. We are booking in Lac Seul in the future, if we're driving 12 hours we would prefer to fish the best waters."
549353,Guest,2005-06-15 21:34:00,0,I have fished the west side of the lake on all of my trips.I have never fished the east bays.What was the average size? Minnitaki usually has treated us well in the number department as well as size. How much better is Lac Seul? We may consider that as a fishing destination in the future.
549355,Guest,2005-06-15 21:53:00,0,"we fished minataki fri, caught @20 eyes below abram chutes in a couple hours. fished there sat by the mines on north east side and caught about 40 with a couple slots and one over. also picked up 1/2 dozen smallies casting shorline including a 19 incher we fished lac suel sunday at crooked rapid, caught 2 small walleys, fished manatiou rapids and caught about 30 with 1/2 dozen in slot and 22 incher. fished the bearskin bay and lost a 50+ inch muskie fished bad weather on tuesday on minataki below the train bridge and caught 30+ eyes and picked up 3 above the slot below the chutes before calling it a day. weather is doing better and english river and twin bay opens tomorrow. we usually do well. i will let you know how i do."

We fished Minnitaki the last three summers, twice in August, once in late May. Best luck in May was Minnicou Creek. Best luck in summer was around small islands just east of Burnthut Island. Usually jigged with white jigs and minnows. I wish I had better spots in Lyons Bay. We stay at Timber Edge camp on Butterfly Lake. On days when the main basin of Minnitaki is rough, it would be nice to have at least decent fishing closer to camp. Any advice here?"
549390,Guest,2005-06-16 15:40:00,0,"Wildcat, I bet that 19"" smallie was a good battle. That fish must have been pushing over 5lbs. Thanks for the info. Wildcat are you from KS?"
549422,Guest,2005-06-17 18:12:00,0,"Wildcat, How did you guys do on the opener. Was wondering which bays and rivers were productive. Do you fish Redpine? Thanks again"
549447,Guest,2005-06-18 22:01:00,0,"i have only been down to that end of the lake a time or two. i want to say moonlight falls is down there which we caught limits in the spring with many in the slot. also the narrows for pickeral arm has paid off on deeper summer patterns. can you trailer your boat north and put in at 5 mile ramp or pay a couple bucks to one of the lodges around 664/72 to get in there. frog rapids, the chutes and the train bridge are all good all season spots and at least one of them can be reached on bad weather days. we usually fish the bay that my cabin is on, on Big V for skies and pike when the weather mucks up. we have pretty good cover there and did well under those conditions last week when we did have incliment weather. i will check with the guys i have renting it this week to see how they fair chasing smallmouth as well."
549448,Guest,2005-06-18 22:13:00,0,"i am from indiana. when the water is high i usually run around in a 20 ft red/white fiberglass procraft, when it is low i keep a 16ft aluminum john boat that is grey with wildcat lodge in green on it. i have been fishing that area for about 15 years, mostly on minnataki, and have had a place on big v for about 8 although i dont spend as nearly enough time fishing it as i should. we got about 100 at the english river opening morning. there were 42, give or take a dozen, boats in there and the action seemed a little slower around us this year vs. last. we were using bigger cranks running them slower and deeper. good size to the fish, no slots or above but a lot in the 15 to 17 and 3/4 range. we went to twin in the afternoon and picked up a 22, 22, 24 and 28 incher off one of the islands again slow and deep and on big minnows. good luck and keep in touch."
