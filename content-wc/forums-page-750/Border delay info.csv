549529,Guest,2005-06-21 07:07:00,0,"Just wondering if anyone has any feedback on the accuracy of the border delay info posted on the Canadian website at:http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/general/times/menu-e.html I've been monitoring the delays for Ft. Francis/Intl Falls for the past few weeks, specifically Friday evenings going into Canada and Saturday mornings coming back. I've noticed that some of the delay times have been a lot higher or a lot shorter than what I'd expect based on previous crossings. The site is supposedly updated every 10 minutes and was curious if anyone else had any feedback. TIA Chuck"
