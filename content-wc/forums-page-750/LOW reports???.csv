549213,Trout Scout,2005-06-14 08:04:00,5,"I have a cottage on Whitefish and the walleyes have been biting in their summer haunts, amazing as cold as the water is. Mostly in the areas you mentioned. 30-32'on the humps. Which houseboat company are you going out of? Have a good trip, Trout Scout"
549224,Guest,2005-06-14 09:52:00,0,"You may also may want to try shallow bays as the walleyes are also in there with some good fish.The weather is suppose to warm up and stop raining so that should really turn on the fish in the shallows.As far as a general area its all been good,good luck."
549227,Guest,2005-06-14 10:00:00,0,Lake of the Woods Houseboats...Dan and Noreen are very nice. We have used them several times before...waaaay back in the 80's! So it is our first time back to LOW since then. Sounds like the fishing is quite a bit better now than it was back then. Back then it was just okay (or...maybe our skills were just okay...). Glad to hear about the regs...I for one do not need to keep any more fish than I can eat that day anyway.

549463,Guest,2005-06-19 21:04:00,0,"Just got back from a trip on LOTW. We fished from June 13th to the 19th, out of Morson with Ontario Wilderness Houseboats. We fished west of Morson in the Sandy Bay, Firebag and Skiff Island areas. We spent one day fishing in Miles Bay. The weather was pretty good with rain on Tueday and mild to above average temps the remaining part of the week. Wind wasn't really a factor in our fishing until Saturday morning. We found water temps to very from the low 60's early in the week to the low 70s by the end of the week. From Wednesday through Saturday there was hardly a cloud in the sky. The fishing was pretty good. We fished for walleyes until we caught enough for lunch and then targeted smallmouth the remaining part of the day. We found the walleyes to be scattered throughout the lake. Walleyes were caught in the shallows in 4 feet of water while fishing for smallmouth and in 20 feet of water along the edges of of islands. We saw guide boats fishng the humps off of main island points. Our primary method of catching walleyes was with bottom bouncers and crawlers. My largests fish was 26 inches in 4 feet of water on a white spinner bait while fishing for smallmouth. Walleyes were also caught on tube jigs will fishing for bass. If you get bored fishing walleyes give the bass a try. Good luck on your trip Like2Fish"
