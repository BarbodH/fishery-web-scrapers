549538,Guest,2005-06-21 08:41:00,0,"I wish I had put the $$$ I spent on my aqua vu into a new high resolution color Lowrance for the front of the boat. The one I have up there now does ok, but not as well as the 19C on my main console. Just my opinion, Chuck"
549481,Guest,2005-06-20 10:28:00,0,I AM CONSIDERING BUYING AN AQUA VU ZT-50 FOR A CANADA TRIP IN SEPTEMBER AND I AM WONDERING IF ANYONE TAKES THESE TO CANADA AND HOW LONG THE BATTERY LIFE IS SINCE WE'LL NOT HAVE ELECTRICITY TO RECHARGE THE BATTERY.
549482,phishfearme,2005-06-20 10:49:00,1242,"robby - depending on the lake, you may be dissappointed or happy. it would be great for an ultra clear laker lake but the typical tanin stained walleye lakes have 4-5 ft vis at best (and some have much less) you probably won't see much. we frequently snorkel on some of our trips and on some lakes it's not worth it. - phish"
549484,Guest,2005-06-20 11:32:00,0,"Robby, We've used my Aqua Vu on Lake of the Woods and on the Winnepeg River system (primarily on the attached lakes). Visiblity is really dependant on heavy rains, wind, etc. but averaged 10 to 20 feet in about 25' feet of water. We were able to watch walleye hit our jigs and rigs, check out bottom structure(to determine why some of our hot spots held walleye), and just to fool around. We only took it one year. After that the novelty kinda wore off and besides, we knew why our hot spots held walleye (clam beds, small weeds, transition between bottom stucture, etc.). It is kind of a hassle to use if you are doing much moving in the wind or with current. I have one of the original Aqua Vu's and the battery lasts about 12 to 16 hours or so. Chuck from IL"
549492,Guest,2005-06-20 14:59:00,0,DO MANY GUYS TAKE THESE TO CANADA? THIS IS NEW LAKE TO US AND VERY LARGE. I DON'T WANT TO SPEND DAYS FISHING WATER WITH NO FISH. THEY ARE TOUGH TO CATCH IF THEY AREN'T THERE!
549497,Trailerguy,2005-06-20 15:37:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]A depth finder will find the fish. I too have an aqua vue, it's a toy, that's not very practical unless you are ice fishing."
549524,Brax,2005-06-21 05:52:00,52,"""it's a toy"" Gee, I can't agree with that. You will learned more from watching your camera and locator together in 1-2 hours than spending a week on the water. I don't use it to catch fish but as a learning tool to see how the structure looks on the locator. Ever mark tons of fish but can't get them to bite? Dropping the camera may show they are suckers and not walleye. I think a camera is a great tool."
549527,Pooch,2005-06-21 06:59:00,4619,"Not knowing everything about what is under the boat and figuring it out by fishing it is what develops skills and makes a truly good intuitive fishermen. I see nothing wrong with using a camera to poke around and see what divers see but that does not make me a diver anymore than looking at a screen and actually seeing the structure makes me a good fishermen. It is called fishing not catching. What we don't know (yet) in life is what keeps life interesting and challenging. Same goes for fishing. For myself and a couple of my fishing partners, figuring out a new lake or actually rethinking a familiar one is what keeps us interested and challenged. The easiest path is not always the most interesting or best path. Pooch"
549531,Trailerguy,2005-06-21 07:33:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Brax, You obiously have developed a high degree of skill with your aqua vue. I've used mine to check out specific areas and even ""trolled"" it to get an idea of the lake bottum. But any fish bigger than a perch always flees like godzilla was aproaching. Trying to watch the screen while going any faster than a drift is like watching a picket fence at 70MPH. Throw in the fact that it has to be raised and lowered all the time just to keep the lake bottum in view, which lets you relate to what you are seeing. That's why I call it a toy, using it is a full time job, and I'm on the lake to fish not work,lol."
549533,Guest,2005-06-21 07:40:00,0,"Brax, you accurately summed up the way I've come to feel about my aqua vu. Neat idea, but a pain in the butt to frequently use.... However, we did have a small musky grab onto the camera for a bit while we were using it in Minaki. Hey, maybe it would work better as a musky bait? Of course, you'll have to attach your own hooks. Chuck"
549536,Guest,2005-06-21 08:20:00,0,THANKS FOR THE INFO GUYS MAYBE I'LL JUST LOOK AT A NEWER DEPTH FINDER.
