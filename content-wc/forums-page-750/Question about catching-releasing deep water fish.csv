I know there are some special considerations when catching fish from deeper water, but don't know many specifics. At what catching depth does the depth become a consideration related to a released fish's survival? I've heard it's best to bring deep water fish to the surface slowly to allow them to adjust to the released pressure. Does this actually help? How slow is slow? I've also heard about poking a hole in the fishes belly near the back end to ""bleed"" internal pressure. Is this valid? Effective? Necessary?"

Some walleye tournaments in our area allow the contestants to do it to keep the fish healthy, but it is really not a job for the novice as you have to know exactly where to insert the needle to save the fish. If you have never fizzed before, don't do it."
