537598,Guest,2004-02-20 10:11:00,0,This resort burned down and that was a blessing. The owners were rip off scam artists and very rude. The people that ran the camp were bad as well. We went there and asked where the fish were and they simply said just fish the english river system dahhhhh dip sh#@ complete jerks. It is said that there are thousands of return customers In the real estate sale I would be shocked. Good Luck Fishin
