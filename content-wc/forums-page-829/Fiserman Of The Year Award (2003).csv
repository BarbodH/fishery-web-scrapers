537581,Guest,2004-02-19 14:03:00,0,I want to nominate Euker (JR DERKSEN). He is without a doubt the hardest working fisherman I have ever fished with. He used to fish every sunlight hour avaliable but now that he is older and wiser he does take time to rest. He has a NOSE for fish. He always finds the best spots and is more than happy to share his bounty with the rest of us. Last year on our first day on the lake he found a spot and the technique that yielded literally hundreds of big Walleyes for the next three days. Im talking Walleyes one after another in the 4 to 8 lb class. JR made sure that we all knew where it was and how he was catching them. Best of all is the fact that all the fish were released to fight another day. My vote is for JR...he is the perfect fisherman. Not to mention he is one great cook and a #1 Father to his Sons.

Like most of our Dads he started me fishing when I was old enough to see a cork wiggle in the water because a Bluegill was attacking a nightcrawler. We fished together every chance we had for all the years he was with us. Our first trip to Canada was in 1965 and we went every year until his passing in 1997 ( age 86). He loved fishing almost has much has he loved God and his family. The last ten years or so we went to Canada it was Dad me and his two Grandsons. The lessons of life and fishing are the same and he passed those lessons on to all of us. He will always be my Fisherman Of The Year and I know that others of you out there have had or are having the same type of experiences with your Dad that I had. In closing I hope that each of you value those who brought forth or enriched your own fishing experience and recognize that your fishing Pals today will bring you your fishing memories for tomorrow. THANKS DAD, I Love You"
