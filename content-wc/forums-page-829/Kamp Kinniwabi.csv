I'm guessing that you have seen their website. we went on up to Happy day lodge on windemere lake ~20 miles west of chapleau, two hours past kinniwabe. my first time fishing for walleye, got a bunch every day after another guest got us started with a bit of advice on what structure/depth to look for. we also caught a few nice pike and plenty of smallmouth. the lake has lakers and whitefish but we did not try for them. we had a great time and are going back this year in my camper. cheers jerry"

In some cases this was a long distance, 1/2 mile or more through the woods, bogs, etc. I was in my 20's at the time and it wasn't an easy trek. I wouldn't even consider it today. My shoulder hurts just thinking about carrying those motors. Don't know the current set-up but you might want to check it out prior to making a reservation. As far as fishing, I'm not a good source of info. That was one of our first trips north and we were still learning. We didn't have much luck but saw some others with fish. His camp was decent. Clean, cheap. He had cabins, sites for travel trailers and campsites for tents."
