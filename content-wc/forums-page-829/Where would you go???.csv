Two of us are planning a 10 day trip in august and are having a hard time deciding where to go. We are coming from minnesota and are looking at Great Slave Lake but keeping options open for something closer. We have a 17' lund w/ a 60 4st. we plan on camping on or near the lake we are going to fish. If you don't want to the whole world to know your favorite spot you can email me at [email protected] Any info would be great and I will keep it to myself. thanks.........Brennon"

It may say North America instead of the world. I don't have my copy handy. That's a good enough endorsement for me."
