537392,Atlanta Dave,2004-02-12 20:55:00,323,"We fished out of plummers lodge about 7 years ago, did 2 fly outs and one enormose boat ride to fish for pike.Our largest was 17 lbs for 3 full days. Babe winkleman was fishing the canmp at the same time we were there they flew out also and we out fished his group.I think if you find something over by the Mckinze river you might do well. Also last year we fished the talston river where it comes into Great Slave and we caught tons of pike in the teens but only 2 over 20 lbs for a week.Could have been because of late ice out. Any other questions just ask. Atlanta Dave"
537455,Guest,2004-02-15 18:09:00,0,"Thanks for the info Dave. We are looking into fishing the Fort Providence or Fort Resolution areas. Most of the info I can find on fishing pike says to fish the river areas starting around august until ice up. It's a 36 hour drive from minnesota, if all goes well. I think it will be worth it. How much did the wind factor in on the areas you fished? this is my biggest concern. thanks"

537462,Atlanta Dave,2004-02-16 06:31:00,323,Pikenut The talston ;river is in the fort res area maybe a couple hours by boat. I would recoment the area and I would think in August the filsh should be heavier than when we were here in June.I dont know where you are planning on staying the camps are all run by natives. The lake is large but if you fish the river you will not have any problem with wind just need to pick a clam day to run over from fort res. Atlanta Dave
