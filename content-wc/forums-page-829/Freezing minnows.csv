Ours in Green Bay; Bobs Bait sell salted golden shiners about 2 1/2-3"" minnows. 5#weight (about 8 to 10 dozen minnows)for $7.50. They prepare them w salt and borax and then freeze.The is cheaper than doing it yourself as you cannot buy them fresh for this. Incidentally, guides and lodges in Canada cannot prepare and sell salted minnows any more. The bait dealers there do not allow it. They can be taken across the border--except if the are smelt--NO smelt can be brought in at all."

Before putting minnows in th ziploc, place 1/3 cup of salt and 1/3 cup of sugar in the bag. Shake the bag to mix the salt/sugar together. Then, put 1 1/2 cups of fatheads in the bag. Shake the bag to mix the minnows and salt/sugar. Then, belch out the additional air, flaten the bag spreading out the minnows and place in freezer. The salt acts as the preservative and the sugar hardens the minnows. Originally, I only used salt, but the additional of sugar helped to hardened the minnows and reduce the salt's effect on your hands."

537593,Guest,2004-02-19 23:27:00,0,I guy at work told me he had frozen some minnows because you are not to bring any live bait to canada. Well when he thawed them out some of them came back to life!!!

537607,Guest,2004-02-20 16:25:00,0,Well thats what he told me. I dont know how he froze them or for how long. maybe he left them in a small container of water and the fish just hibernated. didnt see it so just pass on for whats its worth.

537403,Guest,2004-02-13 11:26:00,0,"Wondering what the best way to keep frozen minnows to be used in Canada. I have taken frozen chubs across before but when we thawed them, they turned mushy before we had the chance to use most of them. I have heard about salting them buy don't know exactly how that works. Any ideas or tips? Is it possible to keep the frozen bait from becoming soft and unusable? Thanks."
537404,Guest,2004-02-13 11:55:00,0,"Forget about going w/ frozen. Last year we did a flyin and we went w/ salted. Not all bait shops sell salted minnow's, I found one here in Minnesota (Elk River) It works out good for the bait shop if you can give a 6-8 week notice, that way they can start to accumulat all of the recently departed minnow as start salting them. I really dont remember the pricing, but it was cheap. I think we bought 40 or so dozen for like $50. The salted minnows will keep for months refridgerated! The draw back to going with salted would be reaching your hand into the bag of SALTED minnows after a couple day's of cut's, scrapes and sctatches on you fingers."

537411,rebelrn2001,2004-02-13 16:36:00,1563,"I used to freeze minnows all the time for use at the nuke plants here in WI. I usually take a few along to Canada too. I would get 3"" lake shiners and let them die in a baggie (if you don't they flip all over the freezer!--as I found out once). Then lay them on a cake pan and put them in the freezer for a couple hours. When they are 'done', separate them so they aren't stuck together and put in a freezer bag...about a dozen at a time is what I do...thats the most I use at once. I many times will refreeze them if needed. They stay on the hook just fine. Yeah, the real thing is better but this way I just keep a dozen or so in the boat in the cooler and if I need some minnows I open the cooler. Works for me!"
537416,Guest,2004-02-13 20:34:00,0,"we use shiners to.when the fish put on the feed bag, you can go thru a lot of minners, we use the frozen when we run out of live bait.But some guys won't use live they swear by frozen. Just freeze a doz. in a baggie and thaw in the boat as you use them.Shiners don't get mushy like fatheads.hope this helps."
537419,FlyBoy,2004-02-13 22:05:00,631,One more addition. If you are freezing rather than salting - after the are 'done' put sawdust in the baggy with the minnows. It helps remove extra moisture and keeps them from sticking together when you re-freeze them. -John

537463,Guest,2004-02-16 06:53:00,0,Thanks for the input. I'll be trying to salt some this summmer and see how that goes.
537484,mwal,2004-02-16 17:04:00,151,I always have great success with minnows prepared this way. They are tough enough to jig or rig with and keep their natural coloer. I mix 1/2 borax with 1/2 pickling salt. put a layer of minnow in a 5 gal pail cover with borax/salt put more minnows another layer of borax/salt until you have the desired quantity. let set in a cool place for 1 1/2 hours then Fill bucket with water and strain minnows out and put into ziplock bags and force out as much air as possible and freeze. I put about 2 dozen in each bag and thaw out as needed. They keep very well and the fish like them. The first time I did this the minnows shriveled up a bit but rehydrated on the hook. We caught over 300 walleyes last fall on them. I don't buy live minnows in o2 bags anymore. Try some. Mwal
537506,Guest,2004-02-17 10:35:00,0,"I have been freezing/salting minnows for the last 5 years and love it. I can trap my own minnows in a pond and catch 6 or 7 dozen each time I go out. This is the first time I have heard about Borax and think I will try it. Here are a few things I have learned over the last few years: 1. Use canning salt only--table salt makes the minnows soft. 2. Place the minnows in salt water as soon as you catch them and let them soak for a couple hours. 3. After taking them out of the salt solution, place them on a sheet of plywood or plastic to dry until the skin becomes leathery (not crispy). 4. Divide the minnows into usable portions in ziplock bags and add some more salt and also white rice. (The minnows produce a liquid that softens the minnows as they thaw-- the rice absorbs that fluid and they last longer). 5. Freeze the minnows in their bags until you are ready to use them. 6. For longer trips of more than a couple days, keep the minnows in a cooler in the shade and take only enough minnows for the day in the boat with you. Using this method, I have brought my bait on 10 day long trips and when I returned home, the minnows were still fresh enough to refreeze for another day. The fish love them!!!!"
