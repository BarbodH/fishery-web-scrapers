535123,Wordly traveller,2003-09-22 13:07:00,9,"Am considering a trip to Birch lake--70 miles NE of RedLake. Any information about quality and quantity of fish would be appreciated. Any information about outfitters on the lake, accessibility by road, etc... would also be helpful. Am planning the trip for the end of May, 2004. Has anyone fished the lake during the early part of the season? Helpful tips on bait, lures, spots,... would be appreciated. Thanks in advance. Wordly Traveller[email protected]"
