537306,Guest,2004-02-10 17:47:00,0,I am interested in booking a fly-in fishing trip into Canada with my son (12 years old). Someone recommended Knobby's Fly-In. Does anyone have any experience with this outfitter? Any other recommendations would be appreciated. We are looking for a clean camp with good fishing action (walleye and northern). Thanks!

537367,ONE TIME DAVE,2004-02-12 09:44:00,110,"Try Arctic Watershed Outposts out of Nakina. Have used this small family operation for 8 years with # 9 in June. GOOD fishing and exceptional service and prices. All walleye and pike you want. Have maps and info on 4 of their lakes. Just ask me. Their web is www.awonakina.com and phone 807-329-5812, ask for Christine."

If there is only going to be two of you, then some outfitters will not be interested in dealing with you. My wife and I used Slate Falls Outfitters a couple of years ago that took just two of us and was great. They are located in Sioux Lookout next to Knobby's."

I assume the rates are competitive with others providing similar services. Did you have the outfitter provide the groceries for an additional fee?"
537408,Hammerhead Herb,2004-02-13 13:34:00,259,I can highly recommend Showalter's. They are between Ear Falls and Red Lake. Their website is www.fishshowlaters.com. Our group has been fishing with themfor almost 20 years. Our group has grown so big that we now have 5 weeks booked with them.

No, we took our own groceries because they did not have weight limits. Thier prices were lower than other outfitters and had a nice bunkhouse for us to stay in the night before we flew out."
