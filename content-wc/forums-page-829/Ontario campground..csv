I would need a resort with boat rental also. Also as far as fishing goes, smallmouth and walleye are what I prefer. I would like to stay around Fort Frances or no higher than Kenora or Eagle lake. Thanks for any info."

Tommy has a nice group of camping spots. Wabaskang has everything you'd want for the fishing end of it and he rents cabins and boats as well. :)

One nice campground is Blue Lake Provincial Park right near Vermillion Bay. You're only minutes away from Eagle Lake, which is famous for walleye, muskies, pike. If you have kids, all the better, since Blue Lake has a nice beach, nature trails, & camp store. Blue lake itself is ultra clear so the bite can be tough. However, it's connected to many aother lakes which you can reach by boat. Check out this link for more info on provincial parks. http://www.ontarioparks.com/english/nwr4.html"
