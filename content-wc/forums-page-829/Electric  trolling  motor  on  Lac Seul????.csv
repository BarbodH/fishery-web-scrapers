537438,Guest,2004-02-15 00:06:00,0,whatever the case may be I tried the electric and generally it was useless. the gas back trolling gave complete control. sometimes the wind will have you going at a 90 degree angle no electric would handle that. I love the gas on lac saul.
537454,Guest,2004-02-15 17:09:00,0,Wow....this post of mine has really got some attention. It started out by me just wanting to throw a little manure at one of my fishing Buds and ended up with some of the responders taking it personal. Well Im back to tell you thanks for the responses. It appears that the concesus of the value of the trolling motor on Lac Seul is a split decision. I just hope the bite is as good this summer on Lac Seul as it was here. Where is Dick Withem when you need him?
537342,hawkeye,2004-02-11 17:29:00,112,"Always keep an open mind, we can always learn something.I had a guide tell me years ago that walleyes will put up with a gas motor so long then move out. Luckly this was demostrated to my fishing party 28 years ago in a small shallow bay on Lac Suel. For three days we were catching walleyes,each day a boat came in with an old gas motor and start trolling, it wasn't long and no fish. We would leave and return to catch fish shortly after he would leave. I have also fished in small shallow bays with 15 boats all using gas motors in fly in camps and I admit it didn't seem to bother the fish as we caught them right under the boat. We have a new 9hp kicker but only use it when wind is strong. With the new Minn Kota wireless remote, why not enjoy the peace and quiet, and I have absolute???? (can't spell) control over trolling speed. Hawkeye ( Fished Lac Suel 52 times)"
537349,Guest,2004-02-11 20:33:00,0,"Thanks for the very original ""I do all my fishing in the water"" Boy, I've never heard that one B4. It will be my first time fishing the Ear Falls area of the big lake June 18, I was just hoping to get usable information. Sorry to bother ya"
537351,Guest,2004-02-11 22:31:00,0,"Regardless what some people may say, an electric is useful and has it's place. That time of year I would suggest you try the Winesaga River, Sawmill Bay. A run to McKenzie Bay might be good also. If you're in a camp boat, take lunch cause you're looking at about 20 miles from most of the camps in that area. The sandbanks might still be good. So much depends on time of ice-out and weather after that, but don't be afraid to try shallow."
537361,lunker99,2004-02-12 08:40:00,236,"AVS, I'm pretty sure the whole point of this post is to bust someones balls that is is their group. That's probably why you didn't get any ""helpful"" info. Will be fishing the same area of the lake two weeks before you. Which camp you staying at? Jigs or slip bobber rigs are all we use. Winnesauga falls produces numbers, while sawmill bay and main lake points will produce some nicer fish. Hope that helps you out some. p.s. We don't waste time trooling either. Tip your jig with a stick of dynamite and you get to choose your keepers all at once. Leaves more time for beer drinkin' and card playin'."
537364,cough6609,2004-02-12 09:02:00,48,"Some of you gentlemen need to look up the work ""sarcasm"" in Webster's best-seller...Great mid-winter humor, hope it helps in melting the snow and breaking up the ice. After trolling up north for 'eyes for 23 years holding on to a 9.9, 15 or 25 horse, I'v been more than happy to give my left arm and my ears a break with a ""trooling"" motor. Yes, when the wind blows I crank up the 25, turn around and get soaked. When possible, I'd rather hear the screech of the eagles and the call of the loon...bring the electric! Cough"

I don't care if you are ""trooling"" or trying to tell someone where to fish, I didn't recognize half the places that were mentioned because of the poor spelling!"
537384,Guest,2004-02-12 15:30:00,0,He is doing a Trool. And he got a bight.
537385,Guest,2004-02-12 16:16:00,0,"Youz just needs to learn to relax, skrut. Winter is weigh long and our minds are boored. Some fella dreemed aboot fishing Lac Suel and how it would be purdy useless to have a bow mount ""trooling"" motor on a 24' Lund's Genmar grabbin cruiser. So, he figures if it tis no good for his boat, well shoot, nobody needs one, eh? So then some fellas go trooling on the boards and getta few bights for fun, eh?"
537413,rebelrn2001,2004-02-13 16:53:00,1563,I went to LS last June for the first time w/my cousins who have been going there for years. I have an electric on front. At first my cousin was confused on how they worked but after the first few hours he thought it worked better than the gas. Much more quiet and easier to control. Maybe the one that posted this silly thing should try it...he might like it too.
537424,Guest,2004-02-14 08:46:00,0,I think he was trooling. *wink wink.
537297,Guest,2004-02-10 12:35:00,0,You guys on this Canada board are funny. We ran a 620 all over and used the 74# maxxum any time the wind allowed last fall. Otherwise the 9.9 works great. Unless room in your geo metro is an issue I would bring the electric.
537298,Guest,2004-02-10 13:17:00,0,We aint taking no stinking electric trolling motor with us. Its bad enough that we have to put up with a Bluegill fisherman who if he fell out of the boat in three foot of water his hat would be floating. Five of us caught over 1100 Walleye last year in our 6 days on Lac Seul without a electric trolling motor and we dont need one this year. We are blessed with having three of the finest Walleye fisherman to ever wet a line and they will keep the rest of the rum dums in our group on fish all the time. During the last 16 years on Lac Seul we havent had an electric trolling motor and we are not putting our reputation on the line now by taking some new fangled high tech piece of equipment that wont help us catch anymore fish. Last year when we got home we had caught so many fish that three of the guys had to have surgery for Walleye Elbow.
537299,Atlanta Dave,2004-02-10 13:51:00,323,I guess the big question is are we trolling or trooling? I guess the electrics dont work for trooling. Atlanta Dave
537302,Guest,2004-02-10 15:19:00,0,"According to Walleye Wacker, they trool. And he say's his buddy isn't the brightest bulb on the tree. All in fun boys, all in fun."
537303,Guest,2004-02-10 16:10:00,0,There you go boys not understanding the finer points of fishing. Trolling is way to fast. Troolling is slooooow trolling which results in catching more and bigger fish. The educational process is so slow when the student has an empty stringer. Trust me his bulb is duller than mine and Im Polish.
537304,Guest,2004-02-10 16:27:00,0,"I've trolled and drooled but never trooled. I've been to Lac Seul 3 times and use my bow mount 24V all the time. Easy to move or stay still in light wind. Just plug it in at camp and am ready the next day. Have Auto pilot and Co-pilot, both are great."
537307,Atlanta Dave,2004-02-10 18:25:00,323,I appriciate you gentelmen explaining the finer points of trooling and trolling. You learn something new everyday. Atlanta Dave
537308,Guest,2004-02-10 18:48:00,0,W. W. 2 Were are ya fishing on Lac Suel????
537317,Guest,2004-02-10 21:35:00,0,We do all our fishing in the water. You will recognize our boat when you see it....it will be the one without a trolling motor.

537250,Guest,2004-02-09 12:05:00,0,Got a friend of mine who is going to Lac seul for the first time. He has a 60HP tiller on a 17.5 boat and he thinks he needs his electric trooling motor. I told him he doesent need it but since he is not the brightest bulb on the tree he thinks he needs to trool with the electric motor. I have fished Lac Seul since they built the dam and he thinks he knows more about fishing than I do. When I first met him he was a Bluegill fisherman and had a nice collection of bobbers for his cane poles. Would love to hear what other Lac Seul fisherman have to say. But if you think he needs his electric trooling motor dont reply because you have been drinking to much moonshine just like him.
537253,Guest,2004-02-09 12:36:00,0,What kind of guys do you fish with? Catching Walleye on Lac Seul is like catching your wife on your wedding night....easy. Even a Bluegill fisherman can catch Walleye on LS. Buy him a jig and put a minnow on it and tell him to put in the water he will catch Walleye. Tell him to leave that trolling motor at home unless he wants to look like a idiot amongst the fisherman.
537257,Guest,2004-02-09 13:58:00,0,"Never fished Lac Seul before, but I heard it's great. However, no matter how good it is why wouldn't you want a trolling motor? It could only make things easier. Why start the big motor to go 50ft. What if you get over a pocket thats holding big fish and it's windy out. That trolling motor would sure come in handy to hold your spot. Sure, you could keep drifting over it but if you had a trolling motor, you'd never have to leave it. Personally, I would have one anytime, anywhere, no matter how great the fishing is. Give me one drawback to having one and I'll throw mine out."
537258,Guest,2004-02-09 14:12:00,0,You are at an outpost camp with no electricity and have a limitation on how much gear you can haul. Walleye jump in your boat on Lac Seul and if you can run a motor it is easier to control the boat going backwards into the wind. The guy who wants to take the trooling motor thinks he is going Bluegill fishing and has his hands full just remebering his name let alone figure out where to fish at or how.
537260,Guest,2004-02-09 15:12:00,0,"Wacker, What kind of guys do you fish with? Is this guy some kind idiot who has been sniffing too much stinkbait? Nobody takes a trooling motor on Lac Seul unless he is going to fish the shoreline for Bluegills of which there are none in Lac Seul. Wacker, you need to upgrade your fishing Buds. Find some that actually have some fishing knowledge. Dont spend all your time trying to make a silk purse out of a sows ear...leave this guy on his Bluegill bed."
537265,Guest,2004-02-09 17:43:00,0,"I believe the ""Lac Suel"" model Minnkota trooling motor would be best, even when not trooling."
537275,Guest,2004-02-10 00:51:00,0,"when we rented a boat we would generally back troll with the lodge motor ,20 hp worked fine. I would think on lac saul that when the wind is blowing a crummy electric is not going to fill the bill. you need a gas kicker. there are some big open areas up there. the more equiptment the better. have the electric on the front and a spare kicker on the rear!"
537278,Guest,2004-02-10 07:13:00,0,Electric trooling motors are the tools of fools on lac Seul. I can remember when we would travel 40 miles across the lake with my heavy wood boat and a 5HP Johnson screwed on it. Back trooling with the modern gas motors of today is the way to go. Anybody who would bring an electric trooling motor to Lac Seul is without a doubt a bubble or two out of plumb. You simply back trool into the wind and enjoy the abundance of Big Eyes.
537283,Guest,2004-02-10 08:48:00,0,"I'd have to question who's a brick short of a load on going 40 miles across the lake, in a heavy wooden boat with a 5 hp. By the time you got there, it'd be time to turn around and head for home before dark! As a guide, why would you find it necessary to go that far on Lac Seul to find walleye? An outpost with no generator would make an electric impractical, but if you're at a camp with electricity, an electric can be a valuable tool. They certainly have their time and place and I'm a big advocate of backtrolling w/kicker."
537285,Guest,2004-02-10 09:17:00,0,When I traveled 40 miles in a day on Lac Seul with my wooden boat and a 5 HP Johnson we also sounded the depths with a brick and rope that had knots every 6 feet. We would leave the dock at day break and be back at sunset. Many times we traveled 40 ++ miles in a day of fishing. Today after way to many years on Lac Seul to mention I pilot a 24' Lund with a 125 Evinrude and a 25 HP kicker with Lowrance epuipment that only my Grandson can understand. The fishing is better now on Lac Seul than anytime during my years on the lake. It is also a total waste of time to try to fish with an electric motor. It wont have enougn power and you can stay on the fish better with a kicker. Sometimes we even use our big motor for back troling when those winds are slapping the water against the boat.
