537467,bronzeback77,2004-02-16 08:23:00,97,"I read a lot of posts about Fly-in outpost camps and a lot about Drive-in lodges. I have looked at the pricing for the fly-ins and see that most are much more expensive and I really don't understand. I have been fishing LOTW for seven years (drive-in) and can say without a doubt there is nothing else I could ask for out of my trip. We caught close to 400 Smallies last year, Walleye, Lake Trout, Crappie, Largemouth Bass and 100s of Northern. And there were several days out in Whitefish were we did not see anyone else all day. But of course I always wonder if the ""grass is greener'. What is everyone's opinion on drive-in vs. fly-in?"
537470,Guest,2004-02-16 10:00:00,0,"As early as 10 years ago I wouldn't have dreamed of drive-in fishing compared to a fly-in lake, but with the improved fisheries in so many places I would rather stay twice as long at half the rate for my vacation dollar. I really enjoyed 15-18 years of fly in vacations, but can now take myself and grandsons to drive-in lakes for roughly the cost of what I used to pay for myself and still catch quality fish and lots of them. Gotta love the lower limits, c&r, conservation licenses and all the other improvements that make Canadian fishing fun and affordable."
537472,Guest,2004-02-16 11:31:00,0,"Bronzeback: This June will be my 1st trip to Canada/LOTW and we are considering taking a daily fly-in. Based on your experience maybe we should re-think that trip. I agree with what you said because we looked at the fly-ins/drive-in and decided on the drive-in(to Nestor Falls area)and decided for the money spent we could save a substantial amount of money and still have a good time catching some fish. The other thing that led us to LOTW is from what we have read as far as the fishing being very good as well as the lakes size/diversity. Leave us a few in whitefish bay. Good Luck,hoosier"
537475,Hawker,2004-02-16 12:10:00,3967,"Have been doing the drive in trips for the past eleven years (Nestor Falls area) and the camp we have been going to in Stephens Bay has now put together a package of half the trip at the regular camp, the other half at a fly in lake with cabin for eight for almost the exact same price as the usual stay at the main camp. Have made a couple of one day fly in's to that lake and our trip this year will be the half-n-half trip. Best bang for the buck I'm thinking. If ya want or need more info, send me an email[email protected] Hawker"
537476,Guest,2004-02-16 12:20:00,0,"My group of fishing buddies and I have done a number of both drive-ins and fly-ins over the last 25 years, and we have concluded that the best deal for us is fishing LOTW out of Witch Bay Camp, a drive-to place. For us, the issue basically came down to the fishery. We wanted a place where we could do everything -- walleye, smallmouth, northern, muskie, and lake trout -- with good numbers and the possibility at trophy class fish. Most of the fly-in outfits offer 2 or 3 species, and many of them are numbers lakes. After a few trips, we got pretty good at reading the literature and seeing through the sales pitches, and figuring out whether a lake was a numbers lake or a trophy class lake just by reading the brochures. I guess it really comes down to what you want from the trip."
537477,bronzeback77,2004-02-16 12:39:00,97,"Hoosier, I have done the one day fly out before. We fished Arrow Lake, I am sure if you asked your lodge owner they could arrange for you to fish it. We caught at least 100 walleye per person (four of us) but they were all small. I am talking an average of 13-14 inches, but it was constant action. It was a neat experience but for the money I would probably just hire a guide for an extra day on LOTW's. I take our lodge guide out once each trip and we go way up to the Sunset Channel and fish Walleye. Two years ago we had a day where we probably caught 50 fish a piece and we had several over 25 inches. Email me at [email protected]; I can give you some spots to try in Whitefish."
537488,Ruddiger,2004-02-16 18:35:00,649,"Over the last 10 years I have done a lot of both. Being a teacher by trade I have the opportunity to spend about 6 weeks a year in Canada and try to do at least 1-2 fly-ins with 4-5 weeks of boat in fishing. I went to LOTW in 1998 and enjoyed it for the most part (except for the most unbelievable algae bloom to ever hit the N.W. Angle during an El-Nino summer). I totally agree with the posts above that drive in or boat in fishing is greatly improved and in some cases equal to, if not better that a fly in, BUT accesability still remains an issue for many anglers. If I lived in a midwestern state that had easy access to LOTW, Lac Seul, Eagle, or other waters in that area I would never fly again. There would be no point (except to risk an early death). Unfortunately,I live in Ohio and for me to drive to LOTW I am looking at a two day drive (21 hours pulling a boat). you factor in two days back and you have to take two weeks of vacation to justify the trip. While this is not a problem for myself, I have a hard time convincing my fishing buddies to give up two weeks of their limited vacation time for this type of trip. Unfortunately for us, eastern waters have a long history of being pounded, and many of the drive-to areas in eastern Ontario still have a long way to go compared to places in western Ontario (or even northern Minnesota) when it comes to rebuilding their fisheries. Because of this, I usually have to fly inorder to get quality shield lake style pike and walleye fishing. When my targer is muskies or smallies there are many good waters in the area that I can drive to. And obviously, there is a great walleye fishery called Erie about 2 1/2 hours away which is preety good too (although I must admit that the style of fishing used on Erie is not as fulfilling as the more traditional styles used on northern Canadian waters.) Hopefully, things like slot limites, C & R, and other progressive management techniques will allow eastern waters to experiece the fishing renaissace that other areas have experienced. Until then I'll need my wings for at lest a few weeks a year."
537489,BuckeyeWilly,2004-02-16 19:12:00,41,"Ruddiger, as a fellow Ohioan, I know what your talking about. I discovered about 6 years ago how much better the fishing is in western Ontario. Have fished Lac Seul and many of the lakes around Sioux Lookout. It can't be beat. You need to convince your fishing partners to give it a try one year. The 2 day trip is definitely worth it."
537494,Ohio fisherman,2004-02-16 20:23:00,989,"Hi guys. Ohio is my home too. I have done the long drives north to find worn out fisheries. Have taken the flights to fantastic fishing too. For me, it is important to take my own boat - it just seems silly to go somewhere to rent an uncomfortable boat when there is a nice boat in my barn. I would really like to try the fishing in NW Ontario, but cannot find anyone around here willing to make the drive. Maybe someday we can try it. For me, the best compromise is a drive to a lake that is remote and has little pressure. And, Lake Erie is a great fishery. Totally different from Canada lakes, but still awesome. Take care, O F"
537508,Guest,2004-02-17 11:57:00,0,"Got a couple of friends of mine who like ""Walk Ins"". They leave their 1952 Ford pickup at the border and hoof it. They dont catch many fish but they get to see a lot of Canada roadside."
537517,IAranger,2004-02-17 15:26:00,352,"This is a great topic I have asked myself many times ...would I be happier to sell my boat and take the cash and use to do fly-ins every year and maybe drive further north etc. I seem to think I need to be able to use my own boat since I have one. It is a pretty good sized glass boat so I end up a large lakes like LOTW etc. I did a fly in once to NW territory and was really disappointed. Love LOTW but would like to find some of the fast furious action like I remember at Eagle Lake in the 70's. The other part I have not been able to get past is all the weight restrictions on fly ins... How can I possibly go fishing with only 125# of stuff ???? that is only my tackle what about poles, reels, electronics, clothes, etc. Hope you make the choice that leads to happiness Jeff"
537522,Atlanta Dave,2004-02-17 16:47:00,323,Fly in every year the last 10 years and would have it no other way. The fishing is outstanding and spoils us for other lakes.Large high teen pike are the norm wilth many 20 plus sprinkled in. Lake Trout are fantsstic with a 30 plus every year for each man the norm. I never feel the weight restricts what I bring. I always have more gear than I can even think of using in a week. Just my thoughts. Atlanta Dave
537523,bronzeback77,2004-02-17 17:36:00,97,"I am glad I posted this topic I have read a lot of great responses. I hope over the next couple years when I get more vacation time and money I can make my yearly trip to LOTWs and take a fly in trip as well. So much water so little time, if only I could win the lottery. A lot of you guys talk about fast action, I guess I am spoiled. At the resort I stay at I know of only one other guest who comes up strictly for Smallmouth like me. I have no trouble going out and having 50+ fish days. I think that the Smallmouth population is very much ignored on LOTWs it all about Walleye, Lake Trout and Pike for the other guests."
537526,BuckeyeWilly,2004-02-17 19:46:00,41,"Bronzeback77, I saw the same thing on Big Vermilion Lake near Sioux Lookout. Everybody was fishing for walleye on Lac Suel (which was right across the road) or Lake Trout on Big V. Left all the smallmouth for us!! Now I like to catch walleyes for sure and even learned how to catch some Lake Trout thanks to the owner of Deerpath Lodge, but my favorite will always be the smallie and man, Big V is loaded with them. What a blast and we were the only people fishing for them!!"
537558,IAranger,2004-02-19 10:23:00,352,Hey Dave those are great numbers !!! Where do you fly in to if I may ask ??? email if you wish [email protected]
537499,jigman 2003,2004-02-17 05:49:00,981,"I have done a number of fly-ins and drive-ins over the last 15 years or so. My experience is that fly-ins provide for fast, early action without a lot of ""exploring"". I have heard the complaints before from guys doing one day fly-ins about the small size of the fish they catch. I think outfitters purposely take one day flyers to lakes like this. They want the fishermen to experience fast action. The lakes I have been flying into provide an average of 20-50 walleyes a day in the 18""-24"" range with more pike from 20"" to 43"" than you care to catch. My drive-ins provided good fishing, but required more time on the water to find a pattern as well as long boat rides to get to where the fish were really biting. We caught many 'eyes from 13""-28"" and plenty of dink pike. Smallies and lakers provided a change of pace in many of the lakes. I have decided that at this point the fly-ins provide more of a vacation for my father and I than a drive-in would. My dad is past 70, so I don't need to be pushing him too hard to find fish. Fly-ins provide a great fishing experience as well as a slow pace for a week. Not seeing another boat on a 3000 acre lake is also something to experience. Just my two cents."
