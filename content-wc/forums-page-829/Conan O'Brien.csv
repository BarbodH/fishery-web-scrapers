Most young Americans are absolutely pitiful when it comes to understanding economics, and naturally, Economic Geography. Many young people think the government is the source of all money from which everything else economic evolves."
537562,Guest,2004-02-19 11:35:00,0,"You know what is sort of funny, is that in the list that TMac provided in above post John Candy, John Belushi, Jim Carey, Chris Farley, Chevy Chase, Dan Akroid, Gene Wilder & Richard Pryor (together), Gilda Radner, Bugs Bunny, Wiley Coyote...... LOL. End of quote Many of the big name comedians on that list are Canadian , Jim Carey, John Candy, Dan Akroyd, others include Colin Mocherie (Whose Line is it) Mike Myers of so much fame! , Michael J Fox, and even Gilda Radner although born in Detroit cut her teeth on Canada's Second city TV program. Oh ya.... we will also take credit for Pamela Anderson because she looks sort of funny in a sexy sort of way. But it should be noted that none of the above ever would go so far as to make french jokes on TV,. But we do make fun of Celine Dion ,"
537563,Guest,2004-02-19 12:02:00,0,"LOL. Yah... I noticed when I made that list... that many were Canadians. And the ones that weren't, honed their skills in Canada. There is a wonderful sense of humor in nearly all Canadians I have ever known. We do plenty of laughing when hanging with my Canadian buddies. No wonder many of my favorite Comics have been Canadians. There are a great many more, too...but that was my ""slap-stick"" list, eh? :)"
537588,bigfish1965,2004-02-19 19:39:00,3210,"I thought some more about it..I know that the French Canadians get picked on a fair bit, but I also know that I laugh my butt off at Rick Mercer's show 'Talking to Americans'. There were a lot of Ontario jokes there as well and I would have welcomed the insult dog in my home town, so while the Euro-French references didn't make much sense since the Quebecois have little in common with them,the rest of the week was quite funny."
537601,Guest,2004-02-20 10:39:00,0,"It was just a joke, grow up, get over it and go pay your taxes."
537495,Guest,2004-02-16 20:47:00,0,"I like to 'axe' the question - ""If you're trying to get away from the getto, why in the heck do you bring the getto with you?"""
537496,Northern Manitoban,2004-02-16 23:11:00,195,"Just like to say that don't let what you here and read in the news bother you.As Quebec isn't considered apart of Canada to allot of us westerners.If it was towards English speaking Canadians nothing would be said,but since it was towards the french,WELL! thats a different story now they have there panties in a knot.And of course our french goverment has to get in a big huff about it.They should be more worried about how bad they mismanage our tax payers moneys.Seems strange to me you can live in Canada (Quebec) and not have to speak english,but here back west when i went to school i was forced by law to take 2 years of french.Its Canada,North America. SPEAK the language! biggest winers in our country our goverment and people from Quebec,been listening to it for years.I would welcome Conan back anytime."
537500,Guest,2004-02-17 07:22:00,0,"Ethnic and regional comedy is pretty well accepted in the US. Blacks, whites, latinos, asians, etc, etc all get made fun of, and New Yorkers bag on Californians, the Californians give it right back, and everyone jokes about the ignorant southerner. Most people have a laugh and then get on with life."
537502,McQ,2004-02-17 08:28:00,615,"Didn't see the show, found out like most everybody else - through media hype. You know, it's fine to laugh at yourself but extremely hard to accept when you're the brunt of an ill conceived attempt at humor. I'm an English speaking Quebecer who lives smack dab in the center of all the controversy. Is it important in the everyday scheme of things? No!!! The thing that gets under my skin more than any other is the pointless shots taken by people who truly have no understanding of just what makes Canada a great country. We are a bilingual nation by law and have been since the very beginning. Our culture is rich and diversified. Too bad that things get out of shape over such a silly notion especially when other Canadians seek to keep the pot stirred.."
537503,Guest,2004-02-17 08:49:00,0,"You have two official languages. You are correct in that part. However, in The US, we have ONE official language and it is English. For 300 years immigrants have come here from other countries (even legally) and learned English so they could get ahead and become a US citizen. Why should someone coming to live the US nowdays have it any different. If you come to the United States to live, learning the language is part of the program. There is no acceptable excuse for anything otherwise. My Grandparents could speak no English at all when they got off the boats at Ellis Island. They learned."
537504,bigfish1965,2004-02-17 09:02:00,3210,"Sorry, McQ......"
537510,Guest,2004-02-17 12:41:00,0,"phern... you must admit...SOME of what is considered slapstick is hilarious. Look at these names and see if you don't recall some hilarious ""slapstick"" type comedy: John Candy, John Belushi, Jim Carey, Chris Farley, Chevy Chase, Dan Akroid, Gene Wilder & Richard Pryor (together), Gilda Radner, Bugs Bunny, Wiley Coyote...... LOL."

537527,Guest,2004-02-17 20:10:00,0,"Connan has some of the best skits arround. Yah, he does make funny faces during his monologue, but that is because he is a goofball. I guarantee that Connan has more education than you, and to say that people who enjoy his humor are unintellegent is ignorant. Have you watched the show more than a couple times? And of course it is easy to say he is no Johnny, will there ever be? You have to admit, it is probably pretty difficult to make 4-5 shows a week and keep it fresh. I think Connan does a pretty good job."
537548,nemio,2004-02-18 18:44:00,96,Being positive I'm truly happy that Mr. O'Brien know where is Quebec because the majority of Americans don't know much about geography so at least this is a very good way of seeing things; and because I know somebody that work whith his crew; they had to search for 2 days to find peoples that don't speak english to do that 3 minutes segments. Being a Quebecer I did not feel insulted because I know more about USA and the rest of the world then the majority of the Americans but I can still be able to laught at a good joke but those one were not funny (I know better). The thing that bug me it's the fact that my governement pay him a lot of money to laught at us or at least try to. Excuse my English because I'm a french quebecer that love walleye fishing and also like all the US wally fisherman. Hope you can join us on a Gouin trip. Good fishing!!
537433,Matches,2004-02-14 20:08:00,236,"I know it has nothing to do with fishing, but hey its the middle of February. I personally think Conan O'Brien is the funniest guy on TV, but I also understand he may have insulted some Canadians this week, his jokes going just a little bit too far. So were you Canadians insulted or laughing with him? Here is a link to news article on Yahoo.http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmp...ada_conan_dc_3"
537436,Guest,2004-02-14 21:11:00,0,"I am not insulted at all,this is comedy.We canadians have a problem of of thinking against American thinking we deserve what he says!"
537437,Guest,2004-02-14 22:54:00,0,"No problem with Conan whatsoever. It is comedy, plain and simple. Yeah it's a little crude, but he uses that style for everybody. I thought it was pretty funny."
537440,retire55,2004-02-15 06:53:00,1029,"The Reuters story headline was very inaccurate - fifteen people don't represent the views of the country. As for O'Brien's comedy, I'm not a fan. Ontario could have spent the million dollars (CDN) in many better ways."
537443,bigfish1965,2004-02-15 08:28:00,3210,"I found it very funny and liked the bit with Triumph the dog in Quebec City (even though many of my fellow Canucks would be mad at me for liking it). If you can't laugh at yourself, you have no business laughing at anyone else. The audiences were alot more rowdy than I thought they would be. I'm just wondering how this all played out in the states. As for the million bucks...well time will tell if it was worth it or not."
537468,Guest,2004-02-16 08:30:00,0,"Doesn't bother me any!!! We have a news satire show up here called ""This hour has 22 minutes"" At least half this show is spent cutting up GW & his actions every week. The other half is spent cutting up ourselves. Thats what you gotta like about North America, if it were any other 2 neighbouring countries insulting each other, bombs would be flying!!!!! its all in good fun!! Jccc"
537469,Guest,2004-02-16 09:39:00,0,"I don't know if english speaking canadian were insulted at his dog remarks on language but I was. Coming in another country and telling french speaking canadians that the live in north america and they shouls speak the language is as insultant as going to the states and telling latinos or black people to ""speak white"" Wonder if they would have taken it. He doesn't tickle my fancy and I would like to have him on a fishing trip with me....up in the far north...alone...well you see the picture"
537487,Guest,2004-02-16 18:27:00,0,"Actually the response was much stronger to Don Cherry's comments the week before saying that French hockey players wear visors( which is true and big fxxxxx deal). This caused such an uproar that 3 government departments have made are investigating Cherry and have made this isssue a priority issue. State run CBC which broadcasts the games has hired extra government employeees to tape delay and censor his future ""coaches corner"" broadcast. I'm not making this up folks. A true banana republic in its purest form."
537491,bigfish1965,2004-02-16 19:36:00,3210,So our respective governmets are both in a tizzy over some boobs on TV then?? :D
537493,Reels,2004-02-16 19:54:00,2876,"I laughed hard, but not because they were in Canada, I would have laughed just as hard if they were in NY making fun of them. <{{}}><"
