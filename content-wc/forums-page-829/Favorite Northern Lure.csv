537391,lobo1,2004-02-12 20:02:00,734,Great question ! I love pike fishing way more than the northern eyes. I have used almost all of the previously suggested methods (and they are all good) but here are two more : Where I went the last two times - there were reeds/cat tails up in 3-4 feet of water - loaded with little guys beggin to be ate. Needing to be in the weeds - the 1 1/8 Johnson Silver Minnow was the ticket here - throw this with a Uncle Josh Muskie strip or some walleye belly meat and don't get caught up on the reeds. I now prefer the belly meat but I dont think it is legal everywhere - check ! For relaxing and gettin a beer or two - you cant beat a salted chub or sucker on a weighted quickset rig on a bobber...... great bait - IF the pike are near - they will eat this. Another cool way to go is with some enormous sluggos - what a riot !!! lobo1
537394,Guest,2004-02-12 23:41:00,0,"My two favorite lures, depending on the sun, water temp, ect... are the salmo perch crank, I caught over 40 northers over 10#s in two weeks on the winnipeg river and the next is the Bionic Bucktail in orange and black, only with the willow leave blade though, can't get jack on a colorado blade, the older ones are better than the new ones though. I have caught many northerns over 10# and the biggest being 18#. I have also caught many musky on this bucktail, the biggest being over 30#'s, the first musky I ever caught also, no wonder it's my favorite."
537395,Guest,2004-02-13 03:35:00,0,"1. Johnson Silver Minnow dressed with a white Uncle Josh bass strip. 2. Bomber Stick bait chgged on the surface, enough to make a racket 3. Rapala Husky Jerk retrieved with an erratic motion or trolled at high speed (3mph or more) 4. 1 oz Yellow or Black hair jig dressed with meat or bass strip."
537402,Guest,2004-02-13 10:07:00,0,"Most productive for me: Daredevle 5 of Diamonds or Williams Wabler hammered copper, about 3/4 oz. But my biggest pike caught on Erie Dearie, Chartreuse/white tipped with night crawler fishing for walleye. Fat, 44"" Northern caught with this while in a canoe, 8 lb. line, no steel leader. When he got beside the canoe and I saw how big he was I told my buddy to row to shore and I jumped out in waist deep water and finally landed him. Measured, took pictures for replica and sent him on his way."
537412,rebelrn2001,2004-02-13 16:44:00,1563,"My favorite is also the ""Red Eye"". I also like the R/W Daredevil but since I lost my one and only one left from a bunch my dad had it is now the Red Eye. The Daredevil I lost was kind of a pinkish/white. I don't know why but that one KILLED 'EM. What I do to ALL my most used lures is to put on a Daiichi treble hook. You can catch 1000 fish on a lure and they are still straight and SHARP!"
537415,Guest,2004-02-13 20:21:00,0,"Last year it was a husky jerk tenn.shad, could'nt keep them off of it.My all time favorite is any topwater bait,when they kill it at the boat it is worth all the slime."
537420,BD,2004-02-14 05:45:00,739,"For trolling the L&S Mirrolure Big Game / Saltwater Trolling lures model 111M and 113M have taken several snakes in the 40"" range. For casting I like a big old BassOreno."
537427,Atlanta Dave,2004-02-14 12:15:00,323,Largest northern 25 1/2 lbs caught on a #14 brass Len Thompson spoon. That is about the largest spoon we use to catch northern. Atlanta Dave
537428,Guest,2004-02-14 13:18:00,0,"Favorite spring time lure is any large Doctor spoon. You can reel it very slow back in shallow dark bays. Great for lake trout too. Copper or brass are the best colors in Canada. ""The doctor will make house calls!"""
537341,tcs,2004-02-11 17:17:00,28,"Hi All, What is your all time favorite Northern lure? Spoon, spinner, jig, etc...Or what did you catch you biggest northern on?? My best is a 42"" using a creek chub in a silver metallic color. Haven't caught anything bigger with it since but still get a lot of Acton with it. Number 2 is the old red and whit dare devil Good fishing!!"
537348,Ruddiger,2004-02-11 20:24:00,649,"Tough to beat an original floating size 18 Rapala. Firetiger, perch, black & silver, or blue & silver. My biggest ever came on a perch super shad rap, however. Musky style glide baits have been great also, but sometimes I just get tired of throwing them (unless that is all the pike want). As far as the most FUN, you absolutely can not beat a fly. Megadivers and other rabbit strip style streamers (Barry's Pike Fly) are great. Not the best way to get a pike under most conditions, but definetly my favorite. Ruddiger"
537354,Scaup,2004-02-12 06:30:00,9,"My best is a 46"" on a buzz bait."
537357,Guest,2004-02-12 07:26:00,0,"Five of Diamonds or red/white Daredevle for casting and a black magnum Buchertail for trolling. Biggest is 42"" trolling the buchertail on a cold, windy, overcast mid-Oct day on LOTW."
537358,Mr.BigEyes,2004-02-12 07:58:00,169,"My favorite snake lure would have to be dragging in about a 27"" walleye. I had a four footer cruise by 3 times looking to have him for dinner."
537375,Guest,2004-02-12 11:41:00,0,"By far the most productive lure I use is a Len Thompson, Five of Diamonds. Catch Northerens, Lakers and Walleye just love em' when casting out of a boat."
537377,Guest,2004-02-12 12:12:00,0,"Since almost everything works for northerns it should be fun to read what everyone's favourite is going to be. I had a hard time just naming one, but I have narrowed it down to a do everything minimalist list that I carry. Jigs and plastic- Personal favourite for overall versatility and effectiveness. Spoons- #1(for action) Etic Toronto Wobbler 2 1/2"" #2(for deeper water) 1 ounce Five of Diamonds Dardevle Honourable Mention- Mepps Cyclops Crankbait- #1 Salmo Whitefish #2(better hooker than the first) Buchertail Shallowraider 9 weight fly rod and some black flies are a blast, and a really good bet for pressured fish. Best was a 43 1/4"" incher on a jig. Could have been a 44"", but it was missing a chunk at the end of the tail."
537378,VMS,2004-02-12 12:16:00,1103,"My number one lure has to be a little Cleo in 3/4oz size, half gold, half maroon. Largest is a 43"" on a shallow flat with weeds and rock. This lure is so popular among our fishing group that we all have about 30 of them apiece in different colors. The 2/5oz size works really well for walleyes too...same color scheme as well. They cast like a bullet into the wind, a very nice flash, and fairly inexpensive at that. Back when I bought most of mine, they were $1.85 at Fleet farm. And the originals are best...the ones with the mermaid on the back... Steve"
