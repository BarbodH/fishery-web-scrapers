I am thinking of bringing salted minnows with for the trip and giving them a try. What is the main forage minnow in the system and what type of minnow should I bring? I was thinking either shiners or fatheads. Any input on the subject is appreciated. Thanks, Otts"

Many small perch are inside walleyes at times when you clean them, and there are times they gorge on tiny minnows that look like match-heads, but I don't know what they are. I have had good luck with leeches or crawlers all parts of the season, regardless of the minnow forage present."

537572,Guest,2004-02-19 13:52:00,0,I think those Smelt like looking baitfish are Ciscos. I have heard that they are a main forage in Lac Seul. Our cleaned fish have minnows and Perch in them among others that are to digested to identify. Not sure with the huge Lac Seul Walleye population that it is to important what they eat. You can catch them on about anything once you find them. Most important thing is to fish slow and stay on the bottom. Always use the wind to your advantage (windy banks & points).
