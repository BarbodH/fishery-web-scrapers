6528842,Pooch,2021-02-18 09:48:00,4618,"ISP took my FOID renewal money SIXTEEN months ago, but I am still ""Pending"" on the ISP website. Illinois government is about as low non functioning as a third world country. Sorry for the sidetrack rant. Pooch"
6528852,bigdaddyguns,2021-02-18 10:04:00,608,It was no bargain before covid either. I waited 6 months and ended up calling the ISP to get some human eyes and action on it. It took another month before moving out of the pending state. You might try calling if you have not already. It seems like the state purposely underfunds this program to slow roll it to the public.

6528892,Hewhocookstomuch,2021-02-18 13:53:00,66,"I not only got my three year Outdoor Card, but my round trip tickets from Richmond to Minnesota. The airline says that I get full refund if I cancel . So why not I would like to blow off a little steam, I know I am not the sharpest knife in the drawer when it comes to computers. However trying to log in on this sight is worst than paying off a car loan. I tried to go on another device, suddenly I was an unknown. I bet if WC made it easier to log in and post we would a larger number of ideas. It took me TEN tries to finally get it right to change password and log in. Sorry, I felt I needed to vent"

6528986,Riverkeg,2021-02-18 18:54:00,134,Kudos to you for living in Illinois and still having optimism lol. Also thanks for the reminder to check the expiration of my FOID. Hopeful to be somewhere else by fall.
6529014,RichA$1970,2021-02-18 19:41:00,1159,Mine expires in April so I guess I’m screwed and probably get a Florida license next trip down to be able to purchase in any other state.
6528478,Pooch,2021-02-17 14:11:00,4618,"Just purchased (on-line) my and my wife's new three year conservation license for Ontario. Now if I could just figure out how to print them as the print box is greyed out, allows me to print receipt, but not the license itself. Will try again later unless anyone has an insight to share. Hope I didn't waste another years worth of license! Sometimes you just have to have a little faith, or regarding the border issue.... hope. Pooch"
6528488,Misdirection,2021-02-17 14:44:00,418,"If you have the license displayed on the screen and have Windows 7 or 10, use the snipping tool to make a picture of the license and save it. Then open it from your documents folder and print it.From a windows system, you can also press CTRL and Print Screen buttons at the same time and then paste into a word document and print.

6528556,Misdirection,2021-02-17 16:59:00,418,Using the snipping tool on windows is really handy if you need to make a copy of something on any screen or web page. Its really not that difficult. I always snag a copy of my non resident ohio fishing license for my wife and myself just in case I were to loose one. I can just print another once I get home.Sent from my SM-A505U using Tapatalk
6528590,Clairebear,2021-02-17 18:19:00,937,"When you're on the Ontario site at the top of one of the pages it should say ""my active licences"". if you click on that it should show you if you have any thing printable. It's been a huge issue for a lot of people, you're not alone. Good luck."
6528616,Pooch,2021-02-17 19:48:00,4618,It only allows me to print out (PDF) a summary of what I purchased. The icon for printing the actual license is greyed out. Pooch
6528732,eyecatcher1,2021-02-18 06:34:00,323,When we purchased our three year license they just sent us a plastic card.
6528750,RichA$1970,2021-02-18 06:51:00,1159,"Well, the good news is you will have plenty of time to figure this out before you’ll need it."
6528762,rosh1,2021-02-18 07:08:00,275,I like your attitude. I agree with you that the glass is half full. My wife and I have just started to pack our tubs of dry goods. Hope they change some rules soon. Still want to ice fish!
6528778,tandm,2021-02-18 07:29:00,679,"Print out your receipt for reference, just in case you run in to other issues. Your plastic card should be here before you even need it. It's not like you're trying to renew a FOID card."
