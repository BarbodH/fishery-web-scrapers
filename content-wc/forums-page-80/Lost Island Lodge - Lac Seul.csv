I had never been there before, but it has always been high on my radar list and I made a reservation for August back in 2019. Something came up and we couldn't make the trip in '19 so they rolled our deposit to '20 and COVID rolled it to '21. I got a call from Bob Bauer, one of the new owners, last night just to touch base and confirm our reservation. I was a bit surprised since as I understand it, the lodge has been in the Hayes family for a few generations and their son is still going to be guiding for the new owners this year, or whenever they actually open up. I'd have thought he would have taken over the place. Maybe he'd rather be guiding than doing the day-to-day lodge and administrative work. Guess I can't balme him for that. Bob seems like a pretty likable guy, from our 10 minute conversation. I'm sure they'll do well once they finally open the gates. I would imagine new owners tend to be eager and easy to work with. Hopefully, I'll get a chance to find out this year."

I told him I didn't think US lodge owners were allowed across the border and he said they made an exception in June to allow business owners in to Canada. They applied for a work visa and were able to cross."

(Close to Sioux Lookout ) You can drive to a parking area and they meet you there to boat across Lost Lake....maybe a 5 minute boat ride at most. If you have your own boats then you can load up and boat across yourself too, but I think they will come and lead you over to the lodge. It is on my list to visit as well. I have never stayed there, but have driven by it a lot on trips from 1996- 2006. It would be one of the few places I  might be able to get my wife to go and visit with me . PjShorthorn"
6519244,ackvil,2021-01-21 16:37:00,177,Thanks. When I looked at the map I could not determine if you drive or how you get there.

Been to many destinations before Lost Island, never went anywhere else after our first trip around 1992 or so. Jim Hayes was there at first, Shane later. Some our greatest memories for sure. All the staff , Basel and Vivian, great people. Wonderful location, fantastic fishing within sight of the lodge, or can run up the lake to a thousand other spots. We live in Florida now, enjoy the salt water, but always enjoy the memories of Lost Island. Best wishes to the new owners, Good Luck"
