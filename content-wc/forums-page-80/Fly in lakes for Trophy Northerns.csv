6523202,tmifshrmn,2021-02-03 12:39:00,30,"We like to fish Quebec and eastern Ontario for trophy northerns, above 45"". We have fished Kesagami, LG4, and Evans. Want to try Misstassini. What other remote, fly-in lakes have people fished in this region for trophies?"
6523228,GBS,2021-02-03 14:21:00,2271,"Further north and west than you asked about, but take a look at Grass River Lodge, ""near"" Flin Flon. Can be a drive to, or they will pick you up at the Flin Flon airport. My best as a 52"". Between the wife and I over 4 days, we had several in the very high 40's, and too many to count in the low 40's to very high 30's. Walleye were a start-fishing 1/2 hr before lunch kind of thing, or if a break from casting was needed. Apparently they are now sometimes seeing 54's(!) While drive to, they run their own aircraft, and have remote sites serviced from the main lodge. They also will fly out to additional remote one-day sites if you stay in the main lodge. Guides/meals included in the cost for the main lodge. At dinner each night, Ike (the owner) stopped at each table, and we all would share where, what worked, etc. with the rest of the room. Kind of a mini fishing seminar each night."
6523252,bthomas3333,2021-02-03 16:13:00,465,Can I ask about your experience at Evans. Why moving from there? I had heard it was def a go to location in that area.Brett
6523290,tmifshrmn,2021-02-03 18:33:00,30,"Evans is a good lake. We've taken at least 3 48"" fish from there. Just want to try new water. Ed"
6523384,Camoclad,2021-02-04 06:50:00,628,Might be worth a message to Mike Borger on Facebook. I would say he has as much information on big pike as anyone and he shares a lot of advice and such in his trip reports.
6523460,LoDo,2021-02-04 09:34:00,721,Jan Lake has trophy northerns and solid walleye fishing. I've stayed at Jan Lake Lodge a few times in my youth. We'd pull plenty of 40s x daily. Jan Lake lodge is first class too. Its up near Flin Flon.
6523496,Shawn200m,2021-02-04 10:43:00,40,"Our group has fished Lake Athapapuskow near Flin Flon for the last 13 years except for last summer and we have caught over 100 mid-40's fish in there, with the biggest being 47.5"". Last year before Covid we were going to make a day trip to Reed because we had heard that the chances for a 50 were better there and from your report it sounds like that's true. That area of Manitoba has a lot of very high end drive-to Pike fishing, probably the best in Canada for drive to locations."
6529938,Wisconsin Walleye Fishing,2021-02-21 12:01:00,1,"If you ever venture into Manitoba, we had the pleasure of fishing at Cobham River Lodge in 2019. While I did not catch a 128cm (50 in) northern pike fishing at Cobham River Lodge, I was able to catch a 107cm (42 in), 111cm (43.5 in), 112cm (44 in), 117cm (46 in) and 120cm (47.25 in) northern pike. For a 5 day trip in June, we had 17 northern pike over 101 cm (40 in) with the biggest coming in at 123 cm (48.5 in) for a group of 6 fishermen. Was a fun trip."
6529942,1100 Remington Man,2021-02-21 12:23:00,73,I would like to go back to Minor Bay Lodge on Walston Lake.
