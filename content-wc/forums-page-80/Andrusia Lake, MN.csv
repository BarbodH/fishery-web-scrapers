6528584,7 Mag,2021-02-17 18:02:00,1887,"I’ve fished Andrusia quite a bit along with Cass and Kitchi, they’re all connected. After the spawn Walleyes will travel from Andrusia via the Mississippi River into Cass lake. I spend most of my time on Cass as it has a lot of walleyes and there’s a good population of jumbo perch, I’ll be there in early June."

6529356,sgeisz,2021-02-19 15:42:00,15,thanks alot for the help. I will post our results.

6529440,andreindy,2021-02-19 19:01:00,308,"Opener is always interesting. A few decades ago I always fished Cass for opener. Went in July last year due to Canada closure. The lake is very different from when I remembered it. It is much clearer. Resort owner would talk about the Zebra mussel invasions. Also, there are a significant amount of crayfish. The resort owner would again talk about that change over the last years. These variables are not insurmountable, but they are factors you need to account for when we were there as I tried fishing it like I did when I was much younger. Granted, your time of year will be very different. We really struggled re-learning the lake. A consideration of course is to get a guide for day and get an idea of how the lake works that time of year....it is a relatively big lake and lots to learn if you are unfamiliar with it. Have fun though. I have always loved Cass."

6530132,Ltrain,2021-02-21 19:41:00,4145,Right when you come out of Andrusia into Cass you'll be in Allens bay. I've had a 100 fish( panfish) day just off the islands. Good fishing close to you
6530164,Guest,2021-02-22 04:03:00,0,"Reality Bites. I have fished Lake Andrusia for over forty years. Beautiful Lake but getting a little crowded. Sometimes the fishing goes well and a few Walleyes are caught. Like most Minnesota lakes, far too often small Norhterns and Perch make up most of the days catch. Musky and Crappies exist but are rare. I am lucky to live on the lake, but very clear water can make fishing tough. DNR statistics show one Walleye per 4 to 5 hours of fishing ( you can look it up).I fish Andrusia 300 to 500 hours a year but I often haul a boat to smaller, darker water lakes in the area and of course look forward to Canadian fishing again. Come fishing here if you wish but come prepared for a dose of reality. You may catch a Walleye or possibly even a limit, but prepare yourself for reality and possible disappointment. As Viking quarterback Joe Kapp said following the Viking loss in their first Superbowl "" and there aint no Santa Clause and there .aint no Red Nose Reindeer""."
