We leave the sloppy joe meat out to thaw while we unpack and unload the boat. We get that heated up and serve with chips and a beer. I put the sausage gravy in the fridge and it's thawed for the morning warm up while I make the biscuits. Two easy meals while you settle in to a week of fishing and fish fries."

6527378,RichA$1970,2021-02-14 16:44:00,1159,Anyone like Duck Sausage?
6527394,gordy28,2021-02-14 17:53:00,437,"Sloppy joes would even be a good one in camp as it's a pretty easy and fast meal. Orange walleye sounds great as I love orange chicken (or lemon chicken for that matter) Never had duck sausage but I am sure I would like it. Rarely met a sausage I don't like (other than lamb, not a lamb guy) Andrew"

Talking to them 1 day yrs ago, they gave me a great way to do the jerk. Its the exact products they use. The spice is used 1st to coat the chicken HEAVILY. Let it stand like tht for awhile. Then the other 2 jars in the pic are mixed together and dived up in each batch. I think for 8 full breast-leg combo i used 2 bottles each."
6521398,Juls,2021-01-28 16:00:00,13414,Thanks! By the way....love your table.
6521400,gmattbruin,2021-01-28 16:19:00,174,Here ya go JulsIll stop now....certainly not a fishing pic. Although ive eaten a few walleye meals here...LOL
6521592,Eyecatcher23,2021-01-29 08:20:00,383,"This is an easy one that turns out awesome and is great on a cold day. It is great with bear or venison, but beef works excellent as well. This is the recipe I texted my cousin that wanted it after visiting for dinner. Iâ€™m guessing the roast I used was around 2 1/4 pounds.I cut two large onions in half and then sliced them thin vertically and put them into the crockpot with a tablespoon of butter, and a tablespoon of bacon fat. I started the crockpot last night and cooked them for eight hours on high, until they were caramelized. I also trimmed the bear roast, cut it cubes, and marinated in Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, and olive oil.This morning I added two diced celery stalks, and mushrooms crockpot. Seared the bear, and deglazed the pan, and added both to the pot, along with 1 1/2 cups of beef broth, 1/2 cup of Lambrusco wine, a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar, a few dashes of Worcestershire, and a clove of diced garlic. I set the crockpot on low.This afternoon I cooked up two diced carrots and added them in, along with a can of sliced potatoes cubed up very small. About an hour before serving I added enough cornstarch slurry to thicken it properly (4ish Tablespoons in this case).Once it got thickened properly Spooned it into the oven safe bowls, and topped with pie crust. 20ish minutes in the oven at 425, and dinner is served."
6522258,gordy28,2021-01-31 08:45:00,437,Wow - thanks for sharing - I have a load of stewing beef in the freezer that I have been thinking of using in a way other than stew (not that there is anything wrong w a good stew) - this may be something I attempt soon Andrew
6522274,Eyecatcher23,2021-01-31 09:31:00,383,"Lots of steps, but none that are too involved, the crockpot does most of the work and it turns out delicious. Before we acquired the dishes, I used to bake it as one pie in a cast iron or oven safe pan."
6522296,ziggyzag,2021-01-31 10:22:00,125,so good
6522510,gmattbruin,2021-02-01 06:11:00,174,"Our group created a tradition for our fly-in trips based on a previous annual ice fish trip 2 of us used to do. The day we fly in is usually a busy morning. It comes on the heels of a long drive, 14hrs the day before. We find that first day in camp is a day of getting organized, set up, boats ready, bunks set up, food finds its place, rods and reels set up and most important....getting out on the water and fishing. So we ALWAYS have a roast pre-cooked, sliced in gravy, frozen for the trip up. It goes in the oven early in the day, on very low, 175F, to thaw and heat up while we are out finding all the hotspots for the week. Its really nice to come in late aftn-dinner time and enjoy and nice beef on a bun. Easy meal, easy clean up, then back out for an evening fish The next night is 100% our 1st fish dinner and the week is on..... Weve done this every yr for all our trips and everyone loves it. Simple, nothing fancy, but sooooo good. Cheers"
6522528,Eckohlt,2021-02-01 07:27:00,3685,"Hey g Matt if I'm ever fishing at a lake your staying at also,can you set an extra plate out at dinner time,I tip well"
6522540,BrianinVA,2021-02-01 07:53:00,160,"Having something precooked for the first day is key. Chili is our go to first meal as it freezes well and makes a nice ice pack for the coolers. Plus it pairs well with that first, cold Labatt Blue. For the second day dinner we almost always cook up a whole ham. The leftovers are great for breakfast (and ready much than bacon or sausage) or for a sandwiches for the week."

6521040,Hewhocookstomuch,2021-01-27 14:46:00,66,"I might have discussed my walleye creole before, but it is one of my favorite dishes to prepare and it is a change from fried foods. {which I love} It is basically walleye substituted for shrimp in shrimp creole. Any recipe site worth it salt should have a good recipe for shrimp creole. If you have a good fish cleaner who can harvest the cheeks be sure to use em'. Takes about a hour to prepare spoon atop a pile of steaming rice. The crew will be going crazy from the aroma coming from the galley."
6521070,stjoeguy,2021-01-27 17:16:00,979,It's very good!
6521094,gordy28,2021-01-27 18:24:00,437,I like the looks of that! We have done jambalya before (pre made) and we just added fresh walleye If you are open to sharing the recipe via the thread or PM would love to have it - even for home cooking - being on lockdown I have started to cook at home but my meals are becoming repetitive - as my family keeps telling me the ingrates!
6521102,Hewhocookstomuch,2021-01-27 18:49:00,66,"I know Stjoe guy has it already written down. If not I will do some editing and post tomorrow. It takes longer to write the recipe than to prepare the creole. That is why I said to find a recipe for Shrimp creole. However ""Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning"" is a must. That's where I found my recipe."

6521248,gmattbruin,2021-01-28 06:31:00,174,"Great post Andrew. Always a challenge, but also a lot of fun. This past yr i did something different for 1 of our non-fish meals. Its 1 i used to cook in our firehouse quite often so a couple of the guys on the trip had had it before....jerk chicken. I spice up 8 chicken breast-leg combos with skin on. Then make up the jerk sauce. 2 go into a ziploc bag then frozen several months ahead. I also bring some sweet potatoes for the meal and they get cut up into half moon shapes, oiled, some cumin, chili powder, paprika, sesame seeds and baked in the oven while the jerk chicken is being bbq. It was hit for those that hadnt had it before and ill be making these up in a few weeks to marinate and freeze for June."

6521366,Juls,2021-01-28 12:39:00,13414,"More info, please. Sounds good...what's in your Jerk sauce? Do you have a recipe? Or, do you just eyeball it? If you just eyeball it, then just give me the approximate amounts...I can figure it out from there."
