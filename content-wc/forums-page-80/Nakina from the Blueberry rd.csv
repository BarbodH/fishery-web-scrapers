6532052,gmattbruin,2021-02-27 09:41:00,174,"I know this question, topic has been discussed yrs ago. Im wondering if anyone from either south Ont or NY,PA,OH have taken this road off Hwy11 to Nakina recently....say 1-3yrs?? Our group annually takes Hwy584 out of Geraldton north to Nakina. In theory and google maps it shows Blueberry rd is a shortcut....but is it really?"
6532092,Eckohlt,2021-02-27 11:37:00,3685,"Blueberry rd looks like a good wildlife rd, other than that I'm no help to you Gmatt,rod"
6532128,Juls,2021-02-27 13:33:00,13414,"11 to 584 is the way to go... Blueberry is a gravel road. Stay on the paved highway. Is saving a few minutes worth the cost of your vehicle's paint job? RELAX and enjoy the scenery....what's an extra 1/2 hour in the scheme of things? Besides, you can get a nice breakfast, lunch, or dinner in Geraldton on your way through. And, if by chance your vehicle would break down....they would find you faster on 584 than on an old gravel road out in the middle of no where."
6532166,Scratcher,2021-02-27 14:27:00,170,If you hit a gravel road in that area after grading the newly sharpened rocks raise heck on your tires.
6532398,Pooch,2021-02-28 04:07:00,4618,Cut and ruined a brand new front tire on my truck on the freshly regraded gravel road between the highway and O'Sullivan's Rainbow camp years ago. That can happen. This was before cell phones. Stay on the main highways as much as you can as there is a better chance of cell service near towns. Pooch
6532420,gmattbruin,2021-02-28 06:15:00,174,"Hey, thx for the updates. Like i mentioned, we always go 11 to Geraldton, then north. The work done on the Nakina rd over the last several yrs is amazing. We usually have no reason to stop in Geraldton anymore, other than possibly fueling up. Its been 18yrs of taking this route and its never failed us. Tbh, i was just inquiring if anyone knew if the Blueberry rd had been upgraded to paved. Its good to check in on other options every few yrs as things like roads change up that way once in awhile. Cheers all"
6532424,gmattbruin,2021-02-28 06:19:00,174,"BTW....had a good chat with our outfitter, Twin Lakes and they have every intent on getting up there and opening. They are planning on being open for business. Obviously in the perfect world, ALL us fisherman will be up there at 1 or 2 times this season. If not then they are very much open to as many Ontarians as possible. TLO has been our go to outfitter for all our yrs. We have a week in June and 1 in August. Cant wait!!"
6532456,Eckohlt,2021-02-28 07:44:00,3685,"I would pay double if I could get in to join you Glenn,think I might move up there that would solve all my problems,everything I need is north of mn"
6532940,onetimedave,2021-03-01 13:58:00,502,Stay off blueberry rd. Yes it is shorter but will take you as long or longer.
6533146,vteye3,2021-03-02 04:55:00,496,Our group has seen the local yogi's hang out by the road last 3 trips. No reason to go find yogi on the Blueberry patch
