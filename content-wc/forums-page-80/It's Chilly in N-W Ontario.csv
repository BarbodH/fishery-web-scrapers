6528588,Eckohlt,2021-02-17 18:06:00,3685,That's a whole lotta ice cubes
6529018,law57,2021-02-18 20:13:00,1147,"Yes - a cold 12 days where I live. The low every night for that period was less than -30. Last Friday, Sunday, Monday nights were -44, -40, and -40. Tuesday night was -36... At least the wind didn't blow at night. During the day the WC was consistently in the -30's and -40's. Just before this cold streak I was telling someone that we don't get the cold winter weather that we used to. I'll keep my mouth shut after this. My house is well built and well insulated. And I put new house wrap and Smart Siding on last summer. It was just toasty in here thru the entire cold snap.Last Wednesday night, 2/10 a log truck ran off the road and hit a power pole near me. He didn't knock the pole down thankfully. But the breaker tripped and we lost power for 2.5 hours. it was -16 at the time with -31 WC. I heat with electricity (off-peak storage heaters). But I have a back-up LP heater in my basement so I wasn't worried about the cold. My neighbors were plenty worried though! They had good reason to be. If that truck had brought down the power line it would have been bad. That's the night it got to -44. No house is going to stay warm and not freeze the water system at that temp. I also have a small LP genset. It won't run my entire house. But it runs the fan on my backup LP space heater, the water system, and a few lights and the fridge/freezer. I could run the satellite TV I suppose. But my internet goes down with the power (router). I don't care - if I'm warm and have water I don't complain."
6529098,Eckohlt,2021-02-19 05:54:00,3685,Did your neighbors come knocking to get warm?
6529114,That Minnesota guy,2021-02-19 06:26:00,8293,Balmy here up on the tundra. Forecasting mid teens for highs today.
6529126,law57,2021-02-19 06:42:00,1147,"No - I got a few phone calls asking if I lost power too. I'm the first year 'round place on the road coming in from the highway. The trees around here tend to evergreen - balsam, spruce, and pine. There is a lot of poplar and some red maple. They don't have the deep roots of the oak and elm and soft maple where I grew up. Quite often a summer storm will tip a tree over on a power line. We'll be without power for a few hours to a few days depending on the size of the storm and the number of customers on the grid that are out. But it's very uncommon for us to lose power in the winter - the tree roots are frozen solid into the ground. It takes a truck driver falling asleep at the wheel to kill our power in the winter. If the line had come down and we knew we'd be without power for an extended period, then I would have got calls. They's all be welcome to bring a blanket and pillow and stay at my house. But we'd all be busy trying to drain water systems at all the houses before they froze.The LP space heater in my basement and the genset together didn't cost me $10K. It adds value to the property and is a value to me in terms of fret..."
6529144,Eckohlt,2021-02-19 07:26:00,3685,"I hate to say it,I'm a tree trimmer and I welcome ice storms in my city,as far as other cities the ice storms can stay away"
6529146,tv4fish,2021-02-19 07:35:00,2694,"law: I gotta ask - I'm presuming that your ""genset"" is NOT located down in your basement?? Years ago - we used to have MANY power outages - So - I also bought a portable generator and wired the furnace (we have our own 1,000 gal. propane tank) AND our private well AND our refrig. so I could run them all during our typical 1-2 days w/o power. We also have a nice fireplace in our living room. Of course, the gen. was located outside, so it was always a constant ""monitoring"" situation - add gas, etc. Lately - we have been fortunate such that the power has stayed on. The gen has not been used much the last few years, and I AM thankful for that."
6529158,law57,2021-02-19 07:49:00,1147,"I used to work on a powerline clearing crew for a big, regional, power company. So I'm with you - I know about cutting. We had a bucket truck and we also had 'hooks' and did some trimming. But most of our work was with a chainsaw. We had two, 2-man, crews. Each crew went thru 5 gallons of gas per day! Yes, we used big saws - 90CC+. And I was much younger and tougher! LOL When I was just starting to think about putting a backup LP space heater in my basement a man from my power company was out at my place. I told him of my plan. He scoffed and said: ""Don't worry about losing power. If you power goes out we'll be out immediately to fix it"". I thought, yes - an ice storm that wipes out a mile of line or kills power to a town or city around me... Who would get 'fixed' first? He was trying to dis-swayed me - instead his comment convinced me to add the LP backup."
6529162,law57,2021-02-19 07:55:00,1147,"No - the generator sits outside the house, not too far from my 500 gallon LP tank. It's under a little cover I built for it. I'm trying to think of the size - it's not big. I suppose I should have bought one to run the entire house. But it serves my purpose. I have never needed more - it's just one of those things that another $1000 could have probably upgraded me. I did have a small (2500 watt?) portable (wheels) generator. But it ran on gasoline. So if the power was out I had to fill it, move it to the house, start it, on and on. I had to be sure I had fresh gas around... It's just a lot easier to have an LP setup - the LP never goes bad and the generator comes on by itself if the power fails."

6528214,prov1800,2021-02-16 15:33:00,5010,Made it up to -15 today.That felt soooo good.Had to wear my sunglassed it is so vright out.Good day to cut firewood.Thursday ill see if i can see my shadow and go fishing.Hopefully our weather will be better the rest of the winter but you never know.
6528234,Eckohlt,2021-02-16 16:55:00,3685,"Even if you don't see your shadow go catch some fish or a cold,but try catch something so we can see it,I'm sure all those minners are waiting to be jabbed with a sharp hook,it's there vaccine shot"
6528242,prov1800,2021-02-16 17:23:00,5010,Rod my WC is causing me problems .Cañt send any pics and everytime i get on her i have to log in everytime.ill see if i can figure it out.Annoying.I do have pics from trout fishing from few weeks ago but cant load them.???.not even from pc.
6528280,Eckohlt,2021-02-16 18:45:00,3685,"Cold weather seems to raise hel with everything,maybe sell your prov1800 and buy a brand spanking new computer lol"
6528290,RichA$1970,2021-02-16 19:07:00,1159,Cold weather also causes shrinkage and not just on the slot limit
6528334,Eckohlt,2021-02-17 04:15:00,3685,"I don't need anymore shrinkage in that area,I'll be way under the slot rich,haha"

6528558,Skywagon,2021-02-17 16:59:00,1106,"Holes in my permanent shacks on a walleye lake are around 30"" of ice, have not been out in the open lately to check depth in undisturbed ice. Some trout lakes I was on a couple of weeks ago had less than 18"" at that time."
6527640,prov1800,2021-02-15 09:54:00,5010,Been to cold.But will get out soon.Probably Wednesday.Need a fix real bad.Next week its looking real nice so will get out on some other lakes.
6527662,jambi,2021-02-15 10:19:00,504,I hope folks who think banning fracking cause solar panels and wind mills are the going to sustain our future energy needs remember these couple weeks....
6527708,Eckohlt,2021-02-15 11:41:00,3685,"I think the only way to go in this weather is a Igloo,well insulated"

6527876,prov1800,2021-02-15 18:18:00,5010,Its usually pretty good.Iam sure they will bite. Be nice to just get out.Sitting in house for a couple of weeks can feel tge oain for anyone that has to isolate.Go bonkers in à hurry.Best times are still to come on the ice.

6527274,That Minnesota guy,2021-02-14 11:37:00,8293,"I hadn't been outside since Monday night until yesterday. My furnace is a high efficiency and vents out the side of the house. During this cold snap the exhaust had frozen in a pile and was nearly plugging the whole PVC coming out of the house. Went out and knocked that apart before it blocked it completely. In my brief time out I determined I won't be going back out for a few more days. I think my blood type is ""common sense."""
6527276,Eckohlt,2021-02-14 11:40:00,3685,Where is the outdoor pics of you trout fishing john in the last week?put your polar bear outfit on and get after them
