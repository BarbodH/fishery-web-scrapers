6528454,David Anderson,2021-02-17 12:47:00,2073,I have also tied my own crawler rigs for 20 years or so. I have switched entirely to Tru Turn baitholder hooks with the downturn eye for snelling. More often than not the nature of Tru Turn hooks creates an almost immediate hook set with the hook almost always near the outside or on top of the mouth. Very few deep hooks although if they are really aggressive I will get some. Most of the time the fish sets the hook themselves.
6528506,Lovetofish,2021-02-17 15:22:00,458,It's a nice way to pass time during the winter months. Just hard for me to get fired up if I can't use them for another year! I don't fish locally because I'm spoiled from going to Canada.

6526942,gordy28,2021-02-13 15:00:00,437,Another winter time post A few years ago after our first fly in I was interested in different ways of entertaining myself over the winter and in between trips Saw a few threads about people making their own lures and embracing my love of the worm harness I started there. I am generally building challenged (red not handy at all) but over time with a lot of Youtube help I made it workhttps://www.northernjacks.com/post/h...worm-harnesses Cheers Andrew
6527102,RichA$1970,2021-02-14 06:10:00,1159,Good way to kill time. I think your workshop looks a lot nicer than the sweatshop in China where most are made.
6527114,bbheli,2021-02-14 06:41:00,1387,"Nice Job, when are the custom painted blades coming out ?"
6527174,gordy28,2021-02-14 08:38:00,437,Thanks guys For the record tying in the kitchen was for recording only lol. My wife would kill me if I tried to make it permanent I thought about trying the spray paint to do custom colours but I am a) pretty useless doing anything that detailed and b) the equipment is not cheap lol I do find myself regularly checking all of the various tackle sites and eBay etc looking for new interesting blades or sale lots and grab them Overall I would say a metallic purple Colorado in number 4 size is my best performer with any combo of chartreuse/orange being next best I do find that each trip or lake seems to have one colour that is the best and by then end of the trip I am scraping my tackle looking for that colour lol Cheers Andrew
6527224,kona77,2021-02-14 10:07:00,236,Have been tying my own crawler harness rigs for years and agree it is a good way to spend some cold winter days.. It is currently -8 degrees right now in Wisc. and I may be doing some of this work later today.. I like the flexibility of tying my own harness's.. Will adjust my leader lengths from 2'4' and use a combination of beads and the little styro-foam floating attractors.. Will also alter the type of hooks and size to accomodate different baits/presentation (including artificials). One of the changes with my harness's is I just use the clevis that allows for snap on blades.. Just gives me a lot more flexibility in the boat plus the harnesses are a bit easier to store for me without the blades attached. User preference.. I just use any excess 12-15lb mono line to tie my Canadian harness rigs. Don't think the fish are that spooky/picky up North. However I do tie separate rigs for fishing in state and will use Seaguar line for my leader material.
6527226,fergiefish,2021-02-14 10:08:00,197,"We have been making our own rigs for years. I have taken the ""simple"" approach over the last couple of years. I take the Northland foam floating jig as my hook of choice. I sometimes add their stinger if the bite is light. This allows the rig to have a little positive buoyancy to float over snags a little better. I use 20 pound Trilene XT monofilament for the leader material. Add three to four #4 or 5 beads, and then the clevis with my favorite Northland blades. I use #4 and #5 Colorado blades in the real image with gold, chartreuse/ orange, and chartreuse/ green my favorite colors. I mix in the purple, pink, and a hand full of darker colors to make up the mix. I have about 100 rigs tied up at any one time and replenish as required. I did not get to Canada this past year and did not lose very many rigs state side. I didn't need to tie hardly any new rigs, so i started my Lake Erie collection of Bandit deep divers. 90 baits later, my better half has asked when is enough ""enough"". Bought a B & B tangle free bait box just to hold them all. I am hoping we can get into Canada this year with proof of Covid shots and test. My rigs are crying out to be dipped in Canadian waters."
6527232,Eckohlt,2021-02-14 10:11:00,3685,You might have to get use to hearing them cry for awhile
6527242,fergiefish,2021-02-14 10:35:00,197,As Al Michaels said in an epic Olympics hockey game; do you believe in miracles? I have to have some hope and maybe a miracle will happen.
6527318,Live to jig,2021-02-14 13:59:00,159,I too like tying them I always tie a double hook set up and usually end up using all the hardware from the rigs that I have tangled up or ruined the hooks on through out the year.
6527390,gordy28,2021-02-14 17:51:00,437,Some good info in these responses On our last few trips I have asked the guys to keep all of their broken bits and pieces as well. I am always amazed at the amount of times a walleye or pike rolls over the funnel and boom just blows the harness apart. I am working my way through those old pieces now lol Andrew
