6530954,Grumps,2021-02-24 13:34:00,134,"I am happy to buy tickets anytime our local/state Veterans`groups raffle off trips or gear or bourbon.Is there any way you or a group of outpost owners could hook up with an appropriate non-profit? The non-profit buys future stays from you folks now and sell raffle tickets for the stays. Folks here in the US buy the tickets. Winners redeem prizes when things open up.Put me down for $200 worth.(Sorry if I hijacked, meant to start a new post.)"
6530978,Wrktfsh,2021-02-24 14:48:00,492,"Regardless of who profits from it, higher prices will affect receipts"
6531006,Obabikon,2021-02-24 16:22:00,2370,"We did that a few years ago on here when Scott owned it. There were certainly some rules that made it more difficult, and has kept me from doing the raffle events. Since I am a for profit business... I believe it falls under some of the ""gambling"" laws."
6531016,Grumps,2021-02-24 16:50:00,134,"Here in the states, nonprofits sometimes buy prizes at ""cost"" from vendors to raffle off. Don't know how other US fisherman would feel but I would love to support a raffle that would help you folks. A few people would win a trip to a spot they may not have been to before. My thoughts were that whoever ran the raffle could pay the resorts now with the proceeds from the raffle. Wouldn't be a lot but could provide a bit of income now."
6531032,Wallychowder,2021-02-24 17:33:00,1567,"I just dont know who would ""buy in"" With the border opening uncertainty ?"
6518380,NM_Trout,2021-01-19 13:52:00,1094,"Anybody know how Canadian outpost camps work in terms of the outfitter leasing / obtaining a land patent or whatever? I've been wondering about my favorite outfitter and hoping that they will be surviving the whole covid shutdown situation. I suspect (but don't know) that water and cabin spots are leased from the Canadian government, and that outfitters pay a fee to the government to allow them to build a cabin and operate that lake for income purposes. Anyone know how this works? I'm hoping that the Canadian gov't is providing some relief to the outfitters during this shutdown period. I'm going to be ill if my favorite outfitter and favorite lake cease operations due to financial hardship. The lights can't come back on quick enough for me."
6518402,Skywagon,2021-01-19 16:20:00,1106,"The majority of outpost cabin sites are leased from the Canadian Government, very few are deeded land owned by the operator (at least in N/W Ontario). There has been little relief for the tourist operations up until this point, money has been thrown out to people that don't even work, but only small scraps have been given to small business that were basically forced to close by government mandate. Be prepared to be ill, another year without income will be difficult for many operations to overcome, not a bright picture I am afraid."
6518470,Obabikon,2021-01-19 20:23:00,2370,"Our outposts are on deeded land, so we own the property. I would say it certainly varies all over NW Ontario. Unfortunately, many of those lease payments were still expected to be paid... despite having little/no business. I hope everyone is prepared for higher prices over the next few years. I'm not meaning to be a downer, I just would hate to see posts on here complaining about people going up 15-20% over the next few years. These price increases will not be to line the outfitter's pockets."
6518532,HeHooksHimself,2021-01-20 06:50:00,725,"Obabikon, Understood sir, it should be expected. Unfortunately there will always be unreasonable people. Reason is limited, especially below your border."
6518872,NM_Trout,2021-01-20 18:50:00,1094,"Ouch.. yes, these are difficult times. When prices go up, demand goes down. Demand goes down, supply increases. Supply increases, prices go down. However, throw in the fact that some (many?) outfitters may simply cease to exist due to the government lockdowns. That has an impact on supply, so perhaps the higher pricing will stick for awhile. Pricing will eventually sort itself out. I'm much more worried about the outfitters in the short term.I really feel for them; I think every one of these folks have built their businesses with sweat and blood and to see their dreams end like this is horrible. Our favorite outfitter is like family to us. Heck, probably closer in a lot of regards. I'm holding my breath. Behind a mask, of course."
6519714,fsz,2021-01-23 07:46:00,144,"Price increases will only work in the short term. A disproportionate number of folks who make canadian fishing trips are.....well not young. As the boomers continue to age-out of trips up north, they will not be replaced as quickly as they are lost. Yes once the border opens many Americans will be willing to pay non-inflationary (15-20% clearly exceeds inflation) price increases , but soon consumers will lose that loving feeling and realize the Canadian government should be off-setting the industry's losses, not hard-working customers. Finally, a certain percentage of business is lost forever, this can be seen with large construction jobs where roads are blocked/closed and customers get in the habit of going somewhere else. After all, its the Canadian government blocking the border reopening as its own citizens can fly down to the American south to enjoy their annual vacations."
6519752,Obabikon,2021-01-23 09:33:00,2370,"You're not wrong. I do agree that the market will shrink, but people have also been saying that for 40 years. The reality is, I have a lot of guests who don't fish any other time of the year except with us. I have many guests who hold a spin cast reel upside down. We can sell a fun, relaxing trip that you can catch fish at. The demand for ""nature"" will never disappear, even if we turn into a ""wilderness getaway"" instead of a strictly fishing trip. The only bunkbed cabins for 8 guys are certainly being converted to nicer establishments. That said... the Canadian government and the insurance companies are in for a pretty big fight if they don't figure something out soon."
6520076,Baseline,2021-01-24 11:57:00,3207,"One thing Canadian resorts can do is ask for a temporary voluntary surcharge as they start up their businesses. I believe their regular and quality customers would offer up some more cash to insure their resort is there for years to come. Resorts could also offer an extra day or discount in future years for those customers willing to help them out. I have been amazed at the amount of tip money customers are offering to barbers, waiters and restaurant employees, and other small businesses providing services to customers. I am a board member of a local food shelf which is part of a large network and our contributions have increased over 100% during the last year. Demand has continued to outstrip resources, but the point is that people know times are tough and are stepping up to contribute. Most of the resorts are small businesses and will need some additional support. Their customers are one of their best source for temporary assistance."
6530572,Guest,2021-02-23 08:52:00,0,"I just hope when times get real good again, the resorts remember the customer. Business has ups and downs and much has to do with luck."
6530840,Obabikon,2021-02-24 08:13:00,2370,"I love and care for my customers. They are family. However, financially, it will take me 10 years or more to dig out of the hole if we don't have a fully 2021 season (which is growing less and less likely)"
