6534388,1100 Remington Man,2021-03-04 20:48:00,73,If only the money went into the roads. But that’s not the case. The conversation for liters to gallons is .264 for the last year or two $ 1.00 dollar Canada is .80 cents US money.
6526444,elkman99,2021-02-12 06:09:00,180,I paid $400 for 28 gallons of gas a couple years ago at a boat in camp.we had no idea it would be that much until the checkout bill arrived. My @ss is still sore from that no lube pounding lol
6526448,Pooch,2021-02-12 06:30:00,4618,"Fourteen bucks a gallon? I'd probably be looking for a different camp. Even if they have to boat in barrels of fuel for the camp, that still seems really, really out of line. One camp we fish charges the same as the ""on the road price"" for boat fuel, but in USD, not CND. Makes boat fuel pretty expensive, but the safety of not carrying into camp (which is illegal by their insurance carrier) fuel cans is worth it. Sooner or later some dumb a@@ with a bunch of fuel cans in his boat is gonna get in an highway accident and someone will burn to death. It's just a matter of time. Pooch"
6526454,elkman99,2021-02-12 06:42:00,180,"Yep, that was U.S Dollars too lol. I despise hauling gas, but we already decided to purchase a gas caddy to take in for the next time we go there one of these years."
6526456,RichA$1970,2021-02-12 06:45:00,1159,I hope the fishing was great as I’d find a new camp from that corn holing you took.
6526470,Bill Krejca,2021-02-12 07:16:00,6107,"Aside from the $14/gal event, my understanding, in most cases, is that camps make little to nothing on their gas sales to their patrons, but have to have it available, obviously. Just getting it in to where the camp is located, especially if a fly-in or boat-to camp, can be expensive. Camps located on a road make supply easier. My father-in-law had a large(think farmer size) gas tank installed at his dock when he lived on a large Missouri lake. He said he lost a considerable amount of gas just due to evaporation. So there are expenses. Bill"
6526490,Eckohlt,2021-02-12 07:50:00,3685,"Sounds like you were running airplane fuel in your tank,by the price,did your boat fly a lot faster?"
6526500,elkman99,2021-02-12 08:08:00,180,"Lol, cant say I noticed it running any faster. But we did catch some very nice fish."
6526620,Eckohlt,2021-02-12 10:48:00,3685,Catching nice fish will always ease the pain somewhat
6527668,fishin779,2021-02-15 10:25:00,63,"I totally agree !! I try to spend my money with the local business folks, they have a short season and I'd like to see them next year. Heck, some of them have become good friends."
6531878,drlee,2021-02-26 17:24:00,409,"I simply use 4 liters = 1 gallon. No, not exact, but close enough for government work. At the two camps I attend, the on site gas is about $6.00 per gallon. I don't mind buying from the owners. I don't think they really try to make a ton of $ on gas. I run a 70 hp Yamaha 4 stroke and have never had a problem with camp gas.On kilometers: I use a simple multiplication. 40K x 6 =24 miles. 10K x 6 = 6 miles. 100 K x 6 = 60 miles. 50 K x 6 = 30 miles. That way I can read a mileage sign on the go and have a decent idea in my head about how far to the next stop."
6526262,elway12,2021-02-11 15:41:00,335,**Assuming the borders to Canada open sometime before we all meet our maker** I have always struggled to understand how much gas prices were in Canada compared to the US. I just want to know if it says like $132.9/ltr. how much that is per US gallon?? I have looked at websites that have conversion formula(s) but none of them make complete sense to me. I understand that it is somewhat complex because of the Imperial vs. US gallon vs. liters(and how liters are stated 1.329/132.9) etc. I don't need to have the US/CAN exchange rate figured into it. I would just like to have a number($) in my head of how much per US gallon I am paying. All HELP greatly appreciated.
6526272,Paul H,2021-02-11 15:53:00,1232,"Look at this site:https://www.frugal-rv-travel.com/gas-price.html Or this online toolhttps://www.mississauga4sale.com/Gas...gallons-us.htm Years ago, before cell phones, I used a spreadsheet and would print out sheet with a range of per liter prices."
6526280,Wallychowder,2021-02-11 16:06:00,1567,3.8 liters to a gallan.........keep it simple !
6526302,prov1900,2021-02-11 16:36:00,544,"Or just multiply X4 and be pleasantly surprised when it isn't ""quite"" that much LOL. Oh, but what I would give to have to spend a little extra on Canadian fuel right now (2nd week of June....fingers crossed)"
6526304,Wallychowder,2021-02-11 16:39:00,1567,At the current exchange thats about $3.50 a gallon US
6526340,phishfearme,2021-02-11 18:32:00,1242,there's 3.79 liters per US gallon (not imperial gallon) - this won't change right now there's approx. 0.79 US dollars per Canadian dollar - this changes daily so 1.329 Canadian dollars per liter converts: 1.329 x 0.79 x 3.79 = $3.98 US$ per US gallon phish
6526352,Eckohlt,2021-02-11 19:09:00,3685,"Myself I don't care what they charge for gas in Canada I'm going fishing,so I don't try to figure it out,with all the free stuff in Ontario it all works out"
6526374,RichA$1970,2021-02-11 20:25:00,1159,By the time we get up there it will probably be closer to $5/g. I got called into a meeting with a Montreal firm on contract manufacturing engineers to cover our Canadian supply base due to the border closure. I told my boss it would be easier to crate and ship the tooling to the states where we can travel to do the work unfortunately.
6526420,Pooch,2021-02-12 03:45:00,4618,Agreed^^^ If I'm using Canadian roads then I should be purchasing some fuel while in Canada to finance and maintain those same roads. Otherwise I'm part of the problem. Pooch
