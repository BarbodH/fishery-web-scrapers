6523598,dosxx,2021-02-04 18:22:00,60,I’ve had good luck with the Eagle Claw rod holders and they run around $30.00. I’ve used them pulling divers behind planer boards with no issues. I’ve never taken them on a fly in but I’m sure they would be fine.

6523792,adempsey2.0,2021-02-05 09:50:00,611,"I use the ones made by Tite-lok. They are light, well made and work quite well.https://www.titelok.com/product-p/rh-5618.htm There are several models that use different sized clamps. Not sure what ones I have, but I believe it is the model that have the widest clamps. The only caveat is you need to have small pieces of wood or thick rubber to put between the clamp and the boat. That gives you a solid connection and the clamps will not move under most circumstances."

6524956,Camoclad,2021-02-08 14:17:00,628,"x2 on these, PJ Shorthorn recommended these (actually he gave me two of them) and they are nice to have on the trip. Like ADempsey said, you need a couple of blocks of wood to make them work out best. You can also find a stick on the bank if necessary ( I know this because I dropped the nice piece of wood PJ included into the drink...)"
6527222,tadler,2021-02-14 10:05:00,43,I use the Down East and they work great. https://www.down-east.com/downeast/i...tegory&path=71
6530102,Bad Santa,2021-02-21 18:23:00,100,X-2 on the Down easter clamp-on models. awesome rod holder. I usually carry a piece of innertube to put over the gunnel to keep from scratching the boat too much.
