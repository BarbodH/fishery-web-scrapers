6524456,That Minnesota guy,2021-02-07 07:46:00,8293,Most of the lake is in the VNP so that would be a good question for them. There are day spots on the lake where you can pull in with picnic tables. I would need to pull my maps to find them up on Rainy. I know where they are on Kab & Nam.
6524464,btyreprich,2021-02-07 08:08:00,1067,"Thank you for your response. While searching the web for info on Rainy Lake, I did see a few photos of picnic tables and fire pits. Just wasn't sure if these were on private property or perhaps had to be reserved."
6524474,That Minnesota guy,2021-02-07 08:20:00,8293,I sent you a pm. Lots of the camp sites will have picnic tables and if you are looking West of say Thunderbird those are likely private property you are seeing. While you guys are gathering info don't overlook the Smallmouth & Crappie fishing. How many guys & boats in the group?
6524482,Jakerides,2021-02-07 08:30:00,223,"There are a number of awesome shore lunch spots throughout Rainy, plus unoccupied campsites can be used for shore lunch. I usually have two places to use in case one is occupied. Most even have a dock and sometime there is even some firewood. I also take into account the wind direction, if its hot I want to feel the breeze. Cuts down on the bugs too. Wayne"
6524528,MN_Moose,2021-02-07 11:09:00,964,"When we were there last fall we saw many of these ""campsites"" with a sign post and number. They are noted on Navionics software. Download the software on your phone and it works great. Doesn't use data minutes. It just follows along with your GPS. Check out the mapping this winter. Most of those campistes were not being utilizec. Just pull up and relax."
6524770,h8go4s,2021-02-08 06:03:00,1673,"From the VNP website https://www.nps.gov/voya/index.htm""Day use: Can I use a campsite for part of the day? There are 33 designated Day Use Sites in the park that are designed for picnicking; please try to use them first. If a campsite is unoccupied, visitors may use the site until 2 pm.No day use is allowed at houseboat sites.""Between Memorial Day and Labor Day, there will be very few unoccupied campsites, especially on weekends and holidays."
6522184,btyreprich,2021-01-31 05:51:00,1067,"While I'm hopeful that the border will be open this summer, I'm thinking this might not happen. Our group is thinking that Rainy Lake would be a great alternative. I'd appreciate suggestions as to which Minnesota lodges to look at for a trip this August. We have never fished on this lake. Having a large body of water that has many islands to help make fishing safer & more enjoyable. We would need to rent a boat & motor. Besides the boat, we only need the cabins to be clean as we bring our own food. Thanks in advance for any responses."
6522196,That Minnesota guy,2021-01-31 07:03:00,8293,Try here.https://minnesotaresortsdirectory.co...-lake-resorts/You will want to book now. The longer you wait the less your chances. Like last year everybody will be full.
6522226,MN_Moose,2021-01-31 08:05:00,964,Thunderbird Lodge was really nice last year. https://thunderbirdrainylake.com/
6522244,Jakerides,2021-01-31 08:31:00,223,Thunderbird Lodge is by far your best choice! Better book quick last I heard they were almost booked solid.
6522282,h8go4s,2021-01-31 09:45:00,1673,Most of the Minnesota side of Rainy Lake is in Voyageur's National park. The few resorts are at the western end of the lake. Best option is houseboat rental; usually they supply a small tin boat to tow behind the houseboat. Houseboat reservations probably will also be tough to get; don't wait too long.
6522314,rather-be-fishin,2021-01-31 11:08:00,429,"I lived a summer on Rainy Lake. Rainy gets a lot more fishing pressure that most Canadian Lakes & can be a challenge to find/catch fish. It's more of a finesse bite. As mentioned above there are limited resorts available & you need to book early. I also highly recommend when you book, hire a guide for a day through the resort right away to put you on fish & show you the tactics that work. (Even though I know you are an experienced fisherman) üòè It can help make your trip a success & much more enjoyable! Good luck & good fishing!!! RBF. üëç‚ù§Ô∏èüé£"
6522468,Shawn200m,2021-01-31 18:32:00,40,"We stayed at Thunderbird last August when we couldn't get into Canada. Really nice resort. Fishing Rainy can be tough, especially since you are limited to the Minnesota side of the lake. We actually trailered the boats to Lake of the Woods a couple days and did much better there. Rainy is beautiful though."
6522740,Baseline,2021-02-01 20:44:00,3207,"Thunderbird Lodge is decent enough and full service. Usually very busy especially on the weekends. I usually stay at Island View which is a quieter resort also full service. Fishing for walleyes in August is generally very good with the fish located on the main reef complexes on the main channel of Seine Bay or through If you have a decent idea of where walleyes usually hang out you don't really need a guide. However, if you have limited time hiring one isn't a bad idea because Rainy has lots of territory. Rainy is big water and it can get kicked up, but in August usually has stable warm weather. If you really want a great experience have your group rent a Houseboat. There are two or three outfits that rent them out. Rainy Lake Houseboats is one of them. Better get on the phone now because August is a busy month up there even when Canada is open."
6522810,Jakerides,2021-02-02 08:30:00,223,"Yes, that can be a good area. However it is in Canada and most likely not open this year. Wayne"
6524454,btyreprich,2021-02-07 07:35:00,1067,"Looks like Island View Lodge or Thunderbird for our group this year. My buddy is going to call or email these lodges and see what the availability is for August. I explained to my son that the Canadian border isn't likely to be open again this year and he's fine with a trip to this lake. His only question is whether or not we'd be able to do a shore lunch. I've never been to Rainy Lake but in looking at topo maps, I see plenty of islands in the lake. Besides having to check on a possible fire ban, are you allowed to pull up to an island and have lunch? Thanks in advance for your responses."
