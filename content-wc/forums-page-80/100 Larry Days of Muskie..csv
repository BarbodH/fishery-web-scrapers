Not an astounding number of fish, what's more special about the Larry is the size. Link here if interested...https://bunksoutdoorangle.com/100-larry-days-of-muskie/ Bunk."

But muskies as you know, require every attention to detail. Quote: Originally Posted by MedyAwfully cruel of you to post this when it is still 15 weeks to opener. Great read!Awwww dood!
