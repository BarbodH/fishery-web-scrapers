6524200,Laketripper,2021-02-06 12:15:00,103,Fischer Lake....about 10 km. north of Atikwa Lake as the crow flies.I stumbled across this lake on a canoe trip about late 1990's. Got into it via Piskegomang Creek from the Back Channel of Vermilion Bay.It was a pre-planned overnighter lake.Lucky me. Paddled around dragging a deep diver perch crankbait...like krazyk711 says..plenty of mid 30 inch musky.Continued on through Atikwa Lake but it was hot and windy and didn't fish the lake.
6524220,prov1800,2021-02-06 12:44:00,5010,"Have been in Fischer.Wilderness Air in Vermilion Bay does a daily flyout out into to tgere for people that would like some muskie action.We have caught upwards of 60 a day in there.Fun for first timers and kids.Another outpist lake Wilderness has with a cabin is Confusion Lake which is a trout lake with muskies,walleyes and pike."
6527290,Canadian fisher,2021-02-14 12:12:00,97,"Love reading about all those NW Ontario lakes like Atikwa on the East side of LOTW. Was in there a few times on sled last year. Going to fish it this March for lakers and pike when the weather warms up. Very close to my home by sled, some pretty sketchy ice on that body of water too. Any real good smaller walleye lakes in the area to check out? What everybody's consensus on potential large lake trout in that area. I fish LOTW a lot and starting on Dryberry lately too. A 40"" laker on LOTW is just such an extremely rare fish compared to the true North. Lakes like Atikwa (known to have one of the highest populations of lakers) but seems they are average size in there too. At least according to the lodge website as most lodges will showcase large catches and if you don't see that its a pretty good indication they are not commonly caught."
6527582,Obabikon,2021-02-15 09:02:00,2370,"I know that they get monster Lakers in Atikwa. Maybe not like some of the up north lakes, but certainly it is the best laker lake for size and numbers within several hours of us."
6531640,mjames,2021-02-26 09:25:00,18,"Just curious, how do you access Atikwa and area by sled? Is there a trail off Maybrun road or somewhere? I would love to venture out that way by sled one day!"
6531684,Eckohlt,2021-02-26 10:41:00,3685,"I'm not sure about sledding in,but if you try don't go alone"
6532102,Canadian fisher,2021-02-27 11:52:00,97,"Correct, via sled. There are a few ways in. Unfortunately we have quite the warm spell happening on LOTW at the moment. Marshes just starting to show run off and by the forecast its not looking good for lake access. Tons of ice but bush trails could be shot in a lot of spots after next week. Way too early for my liking. As for going alone, just be prepared to walk or spend a night in the bush and your fine."
6532432,mjames,2021-02-28 06:47:00,18,Ya it's definitely too early! March is the nicest month to get out there! Thanks for the info! Sent you a pm.
6521954,elkman99,2021-01-30 08:03:00,180,"Curious if anyone on here has fished this lake, and ever had an encounter with a musky? I find it odd that this trout water doesn't have a musky population considering other trout water lakes like Dryberry, Rowan, etc.. do. Especially since their are portage lakes surrounding it that have musky populations. I wonder if its like Wabaskang and just has such a low population density that they are not fished for? Any other non musky info on this lake would be appreciated too. I'm guessing its a beautiful body of water with zero pressure."
6521994,Obabikon,2021-01-30 10:04:00,2370,"I consider Todd at Atikwa Lake Lodge one of my best resort friends. I have actually had the pleasure of fishing Atikwa for lakers. Such a great time! It is a beautiful setting, and you see no other boats other than the few from the resort. We caught a lot of lakers, fishing deep. It's a fun fight, and the electronics on his boats were cool to watch them come off the bottom to strike. I know he has a ""musky lake"", but from what I have heard... that's about the only place you get them consistently. I did not get the time to fish it. If you're considering a trip, Todd and Jake are great hosts!"
6522006,jackpotjohnny48,2021-01-30 10:29:00,153,"I have not fished Atikwa Lake, but I have fished Rowan, Dryberry, Pipestone, Crow (Kakagi), Cliff, Clearwater Bay (LOTW), Vermilion Bay area of Eagle, and some of the other lake trout waters in NW Ontario.Although I don't find it too surprising that Atikwa is devoid of muskies. In NW Ontario, lake trout lakes in general are far more rare than are walleye and northern pike lakes. And lakes which contain muskies are even more rare than lake trout lakes.The majority of lake trout lakes in the Kenora area (Hawk, Dogtooth, Kilvert, Willard, Highwind, Kushog, Ethelma, Hillock, etc) do not contain any musky.However, if you're lucky enough to find a lake trout lake that has muskies, the odds are that the muskies will get quite huge in those lakes, due to the abundance of high fat forage fish such as ciscoes, whitefish, and lake trout. (The walleyes grow to enormous sizes on those lake trout lakes as well).The only other lake trout lakes that I can think of, which would also contain musky in NW Ontario would be...ManitouLong Legged (Stork)Kay (Katimiagamak)MeggisiKishkutenaCaviarBut other than these (and maybe a handful of others), there really aren't a whole lot of lakes in NW Ontario that contain both lake trout and muskies. (But the ones that do have both species are pretty amazing fisheries).""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"
6522090,elkman99,2021-01-30 16:09:00,180,"I have fished Dogpaw, Crow, Pipestone, Caviar, Cliff, NW Arm of Eagle, Esox, and the Manitou for muskies, which is kinda why it shocks me that there is a lack of muskies in Atikwa. Seems like most trout water lakes with any size seem to hold muskies as well. Especially in that region of Ontario."
6522096,elkman99,2021-01-30 16:21:00,180,"Johnny, did you fish Fog lake when you went to Rowan?Thanks for the info Obabikon. Sounds like a great place."
6522098,Eckohlt,2021-01-30 16:36:00,3685,"Dryberry has huge muskies n lots of Lakers n lots of smallies ,my brother use to have a cabin there"
6522150,Bill Krejca,2021-01-30 20:34:00,6107,"Re: Muskies and trout - Crow Lake has both, some very large muskies have been taken. Also portions of LOW.Bill"
6522162,jackpotjohnny48,2021-01-30 21:15:00,153,"Yes. We spent some time in Fog during our trips to Rowan. Fog, like Rowan, is a spectacular body of water. But to some extent I consider it to be simply an extension of Brooks Bay of Rowan, because in most years (depending upon water level) it would be quite easy for a musky to swim from Rowan to Fog if she wanted to. We spent most of our time in Brooks Bay when we fished Rowan, as the southeastern side tended to be a bit darker and more fertile, and we were primarily looking for deep weeds back in the day. If I were to fish Rowan again today, I would do things much differently than I did in the past, as I've learned a few things about trout water patterns by fishing Pipestone, Crow, and Dryberry in the meantime. The next time I go to Rowan, I will spend a bit more time fishing rocks, and I definitely won't be afraid to look for open water suspended fish as well."
6523802,krazyk711,2021-02-05 10:41:00,26,"I fished there alot back in the day of the In-fisherman visits and even put Jimmy Lindner on his first laker. The main lake is just that a lake trout lake, it has a few good pike areas and some giant eye's but there's not enough habitat to support a thriving muskie fishery .Sure there might be giant or two swimming around munching on lakers but those are seldom seen. The muskie lake is an adventure to get to and the primary forage appears to be perch. There's enough mid 30"" fish to keep you entertained but no real hawgs. I've fished it on 3 occasions and caught fish everytime."
6523898,prov1800,2021-02-05 14:15:00,5010,North of Kenora up towards the cnr tracks and further and then east is a number of trout /muskie lakes.But barely fished.One in particular is Big Canon Lake lodge.fly inn.Also very close to this camp is Favel Lake also off the beaten path but very good.
