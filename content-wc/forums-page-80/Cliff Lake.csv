6532742,prov1800,2021-03-01 05:43:00,5010,I dont mind seeing a few worms in the meat. Easy to pop out but sometimes there are way to many to fool with.Perch can be to worst so just dont bring them home.
6532878,Bill Krejca,2021-03-01 10:54:00,6107,"Yeah, ate a number of wormy small mouth on one canoe trip, just didn't tell the folks when I cooked them! However, I really prefer not to eat them. Reminds me of another camping trip where the army worms continually( it seemed) dropped into the fish frying skillet. You could always tell when they dropped - sizzzzzzz! Bill"
6532952,Golden Eagle,2021-03-01 14:23:00,2642,"Eagles gotta to eat, too. Toss perch down wind so eagle picks up the perch and gains anough altitude to turn or fly over your boat."
6532976,prov1800,2021-03-01 15:45:00,5010,Good thing them worms only come every 7 years.lol.
6532194,Bill Krejca,2021-02-27 15:18:00,6107,"Thanks for the pictures, John, it sure helps pass the time. Bill"
6532208,prov1800,2021-02-27 15:31:00,5010,Glad they help Bill.
6532232,Eckohlt,2021-02-27 16:13:00,3685,"That plate looks like maybe $20 cnd funds,not sure what your drink was maybe some dom Perrignon."
6532468,prov1800,2021-02-28 08:03:00,5010,"Whitefish is netted in Eagle,cedar and Lac Suel. Apparently a lot of it goes to Boston where its in big demand.Its not sokd here which is weird.Hales fishery on Eagle sells it and a lot of camp cook outs buy it and serve it to there guests.I only drink water and coffee.Wife will have a glass of wine and usually buys a wine Thats made on Pelee island in Lake Erie."
6532502,Eckohlt,2021-02-28 09:08:00,3685,"John thanks for the update on the whitefish and the wine,takecare n enjoy all the lakes you have to yourself ggggggggrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr"
6532516,prov1800,2021-02-28 09:24:00,5010,Rod as much as i did enjoy having all that water to myself iam really hoping tgey come up with a plan to open that border. Doesnt need to open for cross border shopping or anything like that just let folks in that have bookings.Cant think of a safer place to isolate for a week. Spring to mid summer is out iam sure but can hope something happens toward fall.
6532520,Eckohlt,2021-02-28 09:35:00,3685,Fall time I'm in big time for that
6532568,Bill Krejca,2021-02-28 12:20:00,6107,"John - Re: Whitefish - A long time ago (1950's) , received some whitefish from the Dryden area. They were shipped from some friends who lived there. Fish were taken by net, shipped whole and iced on the way - that's the way things were done in those days. Anyway, the whitefish were wormy. I understand(maybe?) that whitefish taken from waters which don't get as deep - deep enough for water temp survival, but maybe not deep enough for trout, can develop worms. What is your thought on this? Bill"
6532604,prov1800,2021-02-28 14:21:00,5010,"Its possible Bill.I have only had whitefish from certain lakes tgese include Eagle,Cliff,Cedar,lac Suel and Perrault,and a lake half way up to Sioux Lookout called Big Sandy.I have seen the odd worm here and there but never lots.Cedar would be have the shallowist water and have always been clean.Have had many whitefish shorelunches there.Maybe your fish came from Wabigoon.I have notice worms in all species in all lakes.Trout at times have them also and might find one here and there.I usually just get them out and not mention it to anyone.lol.The best tasting and looking whitefish come from the Big Sandy lake and they are absolutely silver in color to like a tarpon. That lake is full of smelt."
6532642,Eckohlt,2021-02-28 15:45:00,3685,"A few worms won't hurt ya,beside's more fish die from eating worms than people,"
6531854,prov1800,2021-02-26 16:05:00,5010,Got out on Cliff Lake yesterday for some lake trout.Got my new pop up finally and had to try it out yesterday and picked a good day.0c and 35-40 km winds.Put 2 ice anchors in and those held it from taking off.Did turn on heater but had to turn it off as pop up is insulated and got to warm very fast.Fishing was very good for trout and ended up catching some bonus whitefish as well.Will be having a good supper tonight.Been reading posts but still cant comment on them on my phone so am now on my laptop and hope this gets through. Tired of all the covid and border stuff and dont pay much attention to it.I hope it does but a lot has to happen first like getting canadians vaccinated and at this point that is not happening for a while.Going to submit this and see what happens.You all have a great weekend
6531862,prov1800,2021-02-26 16:12:00,5010,Lots of these whitefish
6532026,Lazy Fisherman,2021-02-27 08:13:00,276,Thanks for posting the fishing pics. Wish we were there.
6532032,prov1800,2021-02-27 08:26:00,5010,Thx Man.Wish you guys were here to.
6532086,Eckohlt,2021-02-27 11:32:00,3685,John is there a body attached to the head of that lake trout or did you just catch the head?
6532098,prov1800,2021-02-27 11:50:00,5010,Theres a body.lol.Going to eat it tonight.Just showing close up of lure.Had whitefish last night.We forgot how good they are.Whiefish population is going to get a beating.
6532118,Eckohlt,2021-02-27 12:57:00,3685,John how do clean n cook white fish?correct me if I'm wrong don't most smoke them?ive never had one
6532124,prov1800,2021-02-27 13:17:00,5010,We fried ours last night just like walleye in a egg wash and Panko bread crumbs. Cleaning them is the same process as puke and lake trout they also have Y bones.So cut on angle in blood line on a angle in toward top and cut along bones on other side and if you do it right the whole Y bone piece will pull out in one piece.Smoked is also very good.I dont gave a smoker anymore or i would be smoking some whitefish as well as lake trout.
6532130,prov1800,2021-02-27 13:36:00,5010,Last nights whitefish
6532136,Eckohlt,2021-02-27 13:39:00,3685,"Thanks chef john,it's nice your surrounded by a seafood market where you live"
