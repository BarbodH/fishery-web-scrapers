Now it is just a trickle vs the flow promised from the rain gods where they are now saying most of Canada will see rain by September. Although they said there were a lot of clouds in their skies, the clouds are not delivering rain and now they plan to domesticate a cloud in Montreal that wonâ€™t happen until late fall. Seems it will be another bad drought and little rain for Canada this year ago and hopefully those depending on the rain can survive again."
