My first effort is an interview with Chris Brock, a regular contributor here and on other forums - Chris has helped my group out a lot over the years and I thought an interview on his perspective would be greathttps://www.northernjacks.com/post/t...he-float-plane I am totally open to doing these once a month, also open to other topics (Tales from the lodge, tales from paddling etc.) Cheers Andrew"

Enjoyed reading it, and, as a side note, saw your review of the book, 'Beyond the Trees,' which I plan on ordering very soon. Thanks again for the good read. I can tell you one thing, if I was a Canadian citizen, I would take full advantage of the outpost availabilities that currently exist. Looking forward to reading more of your works!"
6532668,gordy28,2021-02-28 18:03:00,437,Hey thanks so much. Glad you enjoyed it and the book review. I have been reading a lot this winter w an outdoors bent so I will put up more soon I am sure I hear yah about an outpost trip. I actually just booked a paddling trip in Algonquin but I am tempted to do a fly in as well if I can swing the time and money. Thanks again for the kind feedback Andrew
