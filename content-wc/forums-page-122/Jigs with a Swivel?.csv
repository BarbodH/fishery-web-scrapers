6329652,srj,2019-06-10 07:50:00,971,"I have used an inline crane swivel for many years...if you hook your minnow in the mouth, out the gill and into the back somewhere, every time you jig your rod at least one twist happens. The swivel eliminates that. I also use a small black snap on the end of the short leader to make changing jigs lots easier. Most of my buddies tie directly but I don't see a difference in catch rates between us. If I happen to break off on rocks, etc and the bite is hot, if I don't have another rod rigged, I tie on a very small black snap swivel. Once again, catch rate does not suffer. I prefer not using the snap swivels as they just look ugly but your jig still catches fish. My thoughts are when comparing a very small and thin piece of wire to a heavy, perhaps funny colored hunk of lead......well, fish brains are small and if seems very unlikely to me that the little wire would detract and the gob of lead would not. At any rate, small duolocks for normal fishing and snap swivels for fast tieups work for me. Good luck"
6329456,Mojo-NC,2019-06-09 12:35:00,1929,"I was looking through the website for a Canadian lodge and on the homepage they scrolled through a bunch of photos of the lodge, the lake, various pics of pike and walleyes, nature shots, etc. to advertise the place. I noticed on one of the photos that there was a walleye being lifted out of the water with a jig in its mouth that had a swivel on it. I cringe every time I see that picture. It always makes me wonder, who uses a swivel on a jig and why would anyone do that? Is it a testament that anyone can catch walleyes in this lake or am I missing a valid reason?"
6329462,Bill Krejca,2019-06-09 13:00:00,6107,"When there are many fish in a body of water, the fish seem to be more competitive and more likely to hit most anything. Also, my dad used to use a snap swivel in later years as it enable easier bait changing due to his eyes' macular degeneration. As for why shown on ad, hard to tell, could be to show how dumb the fish are there, could be photographer didn't notice, etc. Bill"
6329492,Pooch,2019-06-09 15:45:00,4618,"Most guys tie direct while a few use a swivel. I have used the tiny snap that I guess is from fly fishermen. It works, but isn't much easier than tying direct. I can appreciate what Bill is talking about when it comes to aging eyes.I don't care what others do, but as long as I can tie direct I will. Though I'm not sure whether fish care or not. Probably do some of the time.One of my long gone buddies used a steel leader on his jigs so the Northern would not bite it off. He went home after the trip with a whole lot less fish than anyone else, but by God he still had all his precious jigs... Pooch"
6329496,BornToFish,2019-06-09 16:18:00,1224,"Greetings,I routinely use an in-line swivel to combat line twist when vertically jigging. I tie the swivel (e.g. a Spro #10) to the end of my main fishing line, and then run a dropper of 6# fluorocarbon (ca. 15 inches) to my jig. This approach greatly simplifies vertical jigging by negating line twist. I absolutely believe that less man-made material at the jig+bait is a good thing. In my opinion, this is a situation where less is more.I've had many people approach me at the dock and ask about my equipment. If I suspect that the angler is struggling, I make sure to point out my set-up for the terminal tackle, as described above. These anglers are often fishing with snap swivels on the end of their lines to attach their jigs. I've given away many swivels over the years so that the anglers can mimic my system, and thereby remove their snap swivels.I understand Bill's comments about some anglers having difficulty seeing well enough to tie knots.I adopted a new practice a few years ago. I tie up a bunch of the jig + fluorocarbon dropper + swivel rigs at home. I store them on a snell holder, which is kept in the boat. In those situations where I break off the entire rig, or the dropper gets too short, I just get out one of these pre-tied rigs and tie one knot to the swivel. I'm back in the water a little bit quicker and less frustrated. Maybe guys wanting to use a swivel could attach it to the swivel of one of the rigs that I just described.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

6329506,kettyspanky,2019-06-09 17:14:00,271,I use in line swivels also. About a foot from jig. Works great when I'm vertical jigging. That way my line does not get twisted or knotted up.
6329532,Bill Krejca,2019-06-09 18:23:00,6107,"Yeah, I've gotten more and more into using a swivel several feet up when using jigs, to attempt limiting line twist. interesting,I don't remember having as much twist problems( using mono) until using more braided line. ? I'm guessing the photo mentioned which started this thread showed a snap swivel attached directly to the jig eye, which is maybe a bit different than the line twist scenario. Bil."
6329552,kzoofisher,2019-06-09 19:52:00,5144,I use a swivel up the line all the time so they stay on the rods when I go to Canada. If I was going to use a snap swivel at the jig there I would pick a small one in either silver or gold for a bit of flash.
6329612,camp chef,2019-06-10 06:37:00,915,"I use a snap swivel at all times and if I break off, I retie a snap swivel although tying straight to the jig might be easier. The reason is simple. ...the Walleyes don't care....It just plain does not bother them......The swivel give you just enough extra metal to stop 90% of the northern pike saw jobs. We fish with snap swivels in Wisconsin as well and have for 40 years."
6329624,Mojo-NC,2019-06-10 06:57:00,1929,"The inline barrel swivels make good sense to avoid line twist. Here's the actual picture. I was able to copy it from the website homepage. As amateur as it looks, it still caught what looks like an eater walleye. Who knows, it might also help deter pike bite-offs."
