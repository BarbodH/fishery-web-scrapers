Who are you using and what lake are you going to. Went many times with Northern Outposts out of Armstrong.to various lakes Have Fun, Take Care Larry S"
6330206,drew59,2019-06-11 18:37:00,87,Agreed on Silver Minnow. Call ahead and it will be ready. Other than the bait shop there isn't much between Thunder Bay and Armstrong other than bears and trees. I never stopped but there's a place called Orr's not too far north of Silver Minnow. I think they have gas and food. There's a grocery store with beer and liquor in Armstrong.
6330234,Ogoki,2019-06-11 20:21:00,291,"Only one gas station in Armstrong and 2 resturants. The restaurant on the street where gas station is was better last August . Go couple trips a year to Armstrong .Fishing, bear hunting and guiding 3 weeks in August this year. Can't wait . Taking canoe and ATV . Blueberry pancakes for breakfast and walleye suppers after hunting . Life is good !!"
6330292,hoppy63,2019-06-12 05:21:00,367,"We are going with Mattice, to Kag. I appreciate the info. I just want to make sure where I need to fuel up to be safe. I assume at thunder bay and then in armstrong. Any input on outfitter or lake is appreciated as well. Regards, Ryan"
6330312,Larry S,2019-06-12 06:59:00,665,If you don't have a gas hog you should be able to make it up & back from Thunder Bay to Armstrong on one tank of gas. It's about 300-350 round trip.You know approx. what you get in gas mileage so if you need some gas you could get a few gallons in Armstrong without filling up
6330460,Jeler,2019-06-12 12:25:00,92,"I've been to Armstrong quite a few times and if I top off the tank before leaving Thunder Bay in my Silverado 2014 I can easily make the round trip with no worries. Have eaten at E & J restaurant numerous times in Armstrong, all though not a 5 star, they get the job done with great food and service. Silver Minnow is a great place to pick up bait, just call in advance to order.You can't beat Mattice Outfitter's, well staffed, excellent service and a top professional outfitter! Have fun and Enjoy!"
