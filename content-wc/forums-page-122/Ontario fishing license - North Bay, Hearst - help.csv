6328676,Bstar,2019-06-06 09:36:00,564,With the system that Ontario has I don't know why anybody would wait until the week before their trip to get their license. Our trip is in August and I've had my license bought and in my tackle bag for a couple of months now.
6328698,acplumber,2019-06-06 11:30:00,80,If u find a place to get a license they will give a paper print out on the spot. I renewed my small games license 2 months ago and that’s what the gave me. Can also do it on mobile. Did that last year on the way to ice fishing and then took a few screen shots of the license. Good thing I did because we had a visit from the ministry that day and he said he would except that.
6329480,deadhead1,2019-06-09 14:23:00,193,It seems that Ontario is now charging the retailer for the machine and lots have stopped selling licenses. In Kenora Canadian tire still has them but Many of the bait shops no longer sell them. A real pain in the ***!
6329488,IlliniMuskie,2019-06-09 15:34:00,22,I just ordered my 8 day conservation license online with no problems. I used Safari on my iPhone.
6329604,bus33,2019-06-10 06:21:00,289,I bought myself and my son's license without issue using Chrome.
6329618,dukntz,2019-06-10 06:47:00,11,"We found if you created a new account it allowed purchase. FYI, licenses can also be purchased at Ontario visitors center at border crossing. Probably better exchange rate also. Sent from my moto z3 using Tapatalk"
6328300,vteye3,2019-06-05 07:19:00,496,"Good morning -Ontario license online system is busted. I've tried buying a license with correct conservation number (system confirms the number) but keep getting error code. Confirmed my brothers DOB, zip code etc and tried via multiple computers. Can you provide an Ontario retailer ie (Canadian Tire) that sells licenses? We are driving through Ontario tomorrow."
6328308,TitanD,2019-06-05 07:27:00,43,ttps://www.ontario.ca/page/hunting-and-fishing-licence-issuersI had all kinds of problems. I did finally get my license purchased but had to use a different computer with different browser.......there are sime problems with their new setup not supporting certain browsers I think. Good Luck
6328338,vteye3,2019-06-05 08:39:00,496,"Yes, suspect my old home computer does not have a compatible browser but tried the work computer using different email address and still not working."
6328356,dosxx,2019-06-05 09:11:00,60,"I’m not sure where you are driving from but if you are going through the Soo, the welcome center just outside of customs sells licenses— we stop every year to get them."
6328380,grindstone,2019-06-05 10:24:00,201,I bought mine online yesterday after 2 failures - operator error it appears. It required that I set up an account which I never had needed in years past. I was working with a current outdoor card and bought an 8 day conservation. As a preference I always buy my licenses online as I love to print multiple copies. I leave one in the truck one in each T bag. Always use zip lock bags or similar. I have seen similar online threads that also talked about long Ontario MNR hold times so I kept cussing and kept typing and lo and behold 4 copies are waiting to be folded bagged.
6328390,Larry S,2019-06-05 11:10:00,665,Just replaced my outdoors card online Took about 5 minutes to do
6328422,TitanD,2019-06-05 12:22:00,43,If your browser is supported by the online tool it is easy breezy but not all browsers are supported which is causing a lot of folks to get errors.
6328438,vteye3,2019-06-05 13:08:00,496,I played with system again today 4th day. No change still bouncing me out providing error message. I did search for places to buy a license and will get one tomorrow on the way to Nakina. Depart in 5 hours fishing report to follow an thanks to those that responded.
6328516,rickn,2019-06-05 16:55:00,993,"I bought my sportsman annual last night, no problem. I did have to set up an account."
6328588,acplumber,2019-06-06 05:03:00,80,"Am Canadian, yes usually the Canadian tire stores sell them. Also home hardware stores do some times. Where r u crossings the boarder? Can also try bass pro in Vaughn or Cabela’s in Barrie. Epps outdoors in orillia."
