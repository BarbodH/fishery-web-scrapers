I've been doing my guiding from Moosehorn a very long time, and it's a nice camp, with probably a 95% return guest rate. Centrally located for this area's lakes, fishing options in any weather, many places to hide and produce well. Best team of guides possible, experienced, everybody has great trips. I'm nonstop booked as well over a year in advance. Lac Seul is a ten minute boat ride to either run the rapids in high water, or portage across quickly via our own truck,trailer and driver. I personally trailer my rig to Hudson Landing(Boat Bay), 15 mins down the rd. Congrats on getting a last minute booking here, you'll be very happy!&#x1f3a3;"

6329884,Lmbkiller,2019-06-10 22:44:00,639,Doubtful u get a place this late in the game. Everyone and their grandma goes here now. I been goin since 91' and it's ridiculous now. Good luck bro
6330004,bigwalleye1,2019-06-11 08:34:00,2632,"I agree with lmbkiller. At this stage of the game, you may be better off finding a place that has openings for this year and going from there."
6330006,reddemon2,2019-06-11 08:36:00,255,Actually found the exact dates i'm looking for at Moosehorn
6330012,IaDave14,2019-06-11 08:45:00,99,I think they have a couple of guides working out of there something to consider for a day.
6330026,bigwalleye1,2019-06-11 09:02:00,2632,"That's great you could find a spot. Know though, that Moosehorn is not located on Lac Seul, per se. They're on Pelican, and there's a definite boat ride required to get into Lac Seul."
6330090,narly12,2019-06-11 11:18:00,13,"Kinda late in the year but you might try Lost Island Lodge. About 200 miles north of International Falls. Lodge is on an island so you could motor out or they will pick you up. Does not have leeches or worms, but everything else. Great folks and very, very, good guides. Check out their web site."
6330094,Baseline,2019-06-11 11:40:00,3207,"Living close to the Canadian border my buddies and I make frequent snap trips to resorts up north and rarely have trouble finding an opening. Your question about which part of Lac Suel is best is hard to answer because the whole lake has excellent fishing. Personally, in summer months, I like the east side. Chamberlin Narrows has great mid summer walleye, pike and muskie fishing."
6330608,Yellowfin123,2019-06-12 19:26:00,2182,went last year last minute and could have got into outpost for 4 days but ended up going to mahkwa no problem! it was 1st week of july
6330626,Aspencreek,2019-06-12 20:31:00,2911,"If you can get into any place on LS yet this summer you are going to be very lucky. Lucky because you found a place that had a cancellation or and more likely, the place is not one of the better camps on the lake."
