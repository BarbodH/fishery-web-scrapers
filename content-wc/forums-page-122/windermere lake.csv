6329586,pinenut,2019-06-10 02:45:00,16,"hey kzoo, sounds like you've ''been there done that'' this will be our first time taking the trailer and dog through canada, any advice on customs, food restrictions or a heads up on what to expect at happy day lodge, it sounds like this is a good camp with good people, looking forward to the trip. thanks for the feedback. pinenut"
6329690,papadave,2019-06-10 09:21:00,151,"Thank you for the date. I'll be a month later so no issue. There are three restaurants for breakfast between 40 minutes to an hour of leaving the border crossing going north. Lorri's Country Kitchen opens 7am, Chippewa River Restaurant opens 7am and probably the most popular is Voyageur's Lodge which unfortunately doesn't open until 8 am. You can find the exact locations on Google. Since I'll be earlier this year I think I'm going to try Chippewa River for breakfast. kzoofisher Have you found a decent place to stay around Wawa? People that have stayed at Voyageur's at Batchawana Bay say it is clean and very well kept. I ate there on my way home last year and the restaurant was really good too. Although it would add 90 minutes to your morning commute even getting out by 9am would get you to Happy Day before noon."
6329728,kzoofisher,2019-06-10 12:02:00,5144,"Mystic Isle in Wawa has been good for us. It sits up on a hill well above the road with a nice view. Contractors working the area stay there as well and that gives us confidence for the safety of our gear. Stayed at Water Tower Inn in SSM last year, 6 vehicles broken into, including two of ours."
6329738,papadave,2019-06-10 12:30:00,151,"If you remember after you have stayed there this year let me know how Mystic Isle was. I have been staying at Plaza Motor Inn on the MI side of SSM and then going across the border in the very early AM. The police station is right across the street from the motel so it's pretty safe. Do you have a favorite place to eat around Wawa? I've been looking for a good lunch place but there isn't a lot of options when towing a boat. Last year I made the mistake of pulling into the Horton's in Wawa with the boat on. I couldn't see that the turn around area was completely full and blocked off. So I had to make that hairpin turn and go through the drive thru just to get out. I had less than one inch of clearance on both sides. The girl at the window said, ""Well I don't see that every day!"""
6329748,kzoofisher,2019-06-10 12:47:00,5144,"pinenut,I've never taken a dog with me. As far as customs, food and extra gas we've never had any issues. If you don't want to take some perishables there's a store in Wawa where you can stock up on eggs and such. I think the only current restrictions are on eggs and poultry from Indiana but I'm not sure. If you take worms they have to be bedded in paper. Minnows at the lodge are small, like 2"", and they have worms and leeches too. 1 doz crawlers was 2.50 last year iirc. We have all our paperwork in order and out before we cross, windows down and hats off when we pull up to the guard house. The only odd question we ever got was the guard asking what we did for a living. After he asked me and the driver he asked my pre-teen boys in the back seat with kind of a smirk. They look confused so I told him they just sponge off me. He laughed and wished us a nice trip.Bob and Sondra are very nice and will mark up a map for you of likely places. There are quite a few regulars there who stay weeks at a time. I don't know the lodge end, only Nicholson Bay and west. Goldie lake is a portage they keep boats on, it's full of smallmouth and you can rent a small motor for I think $25. Kathleen is also a portage without motors. Other WC regulars who have stayed at the lodge are papadave, 3MTA3, Sport dog and Mr.Simon."
6329762,kzoofisher,2019-06-10 13:42:00,5144,"We stayed at Mystic Isle in '17 and it was fine. Clean, comfortable beds, nice management, and quiet. There's a restaurant across 17 but it wasn't open for breakfast. We ate at the Embassy downtown, food was good not great. Plenty of parking for a truck and trailer on the street and there were several rigs besides ours. Only reason we stayed in SSM last year is there were 8 of us and we couldn't get three rooms in Wawa. You've got a lot further to drive than I do and those last 3 hours from SSM might make for a long day. Before that we've stayed at a Days Inn in SSM that was a dump, my cabin in Grayling, another guys cabin and driven straight through. The cabins make for a 6 hour drive on Saturday which wasn't worth it imo. My preference would be to drive straight through and not stay the night at all. Half the guys feel differently. The way I see it, we could hit the road around 11pm and miss all the traffic, have a smooth crossing at 4am, take a big breakfast break somewhere and be at the lodge by 11. They never seem to mind us arriving a little early and getting all our stuff prepped while they're cleaning cabins. We usually get checked in and are motoring to the outpost by noon, unloaded and fishing by 1:30 at the latest. Whether we stay the night somewhere or not doesn't really change the timing but I'm not in vacation mode yet and tend to sit around a hotel room for a couple hours in the morning being antsy and wanting to get rolling."
6329780,Bill Krejca,2019-06-10 15:07:00,6107,"Re: staying vs driving through - a friend decided to start out in the evening to get home instead of waiting until morning as usual, he hit a deer in the dark. Just sayin'. Bill"
6328688,pinenut,2019-06-06 10:48:00,16,"hey guys, as luck would have it I'm dragging my wife, dog and camper across the international bridge in s.s.m. the same day as the annual bridge walk. I hope to beat it by crossing around 6:00 A.M. We then will take #17 to wawa and 101 to windermere lake. anyone been up that way yet? a road report or fishing story would be greatly appreciated. thanks, pinenut"
6328716,Golden Eagle,2019-06-06 12:08:00,2642,"Pretty sure you'd still go, even if roads are bad and bite of slow. That's all I have to offer, but you already knew that. Have a good week with nice people and good fishing."
6328804,papadave,2019-06-06 17:37:00,151,What's the date of that bridge walk? Where are you stopping for breakfast on 17?
6328828,kzoofisher,2019-06-06 18:32:00,5144,I've never known 17 to 101 not to be an easy ride and I've done it every year for a while.
6328884,pinenut,2019-06-07 01:44:00,16,"the bridge walk is in the A.M. of 6/29, no breakfast schedule yet. any suggestions?"
6328956,Larry S,2019-06-07 08:15:00,665,"Depending upon where you live, could you cross border at Pidgeon River?, if so it would save a lot of time. 17 is right there to go east to wawa"
6329060,pinenut,2019-06-07 14:19:00,16,"hey larry, we will be coming up through Michigan, so I emailed the s.s.m. tourism lady, and she says I'm good to go if I cross before 9:00A.M. now I just have to have ducks in a row to cross the border with the camper and our beagle dog. (first time up with both) just now studying the food allotment and restrictions. fat dog should be o.k. just need a current shot record. thanks for getting back with me. jim"
6329068,kzoofisher,2019-06-07 14:51:00,5144,"Lots of construction on I-75 through Detroit. Budget time if you're going that way and passing through around rush hour. I-69 to US 127 is construction free, US 131 has a little north of Grand Rapids. Timing is wrong but Java Joe's in St Ignace MI is a good breakfast. Still an hour from SSM."
6329482,tmeo,2019-06-09 14:26:00,6,"Just got an email from the GM of the bridge, he wrote The time to cross the bridge will depend on your travel plans. The closure is a short term closure and not for the entire day. I would recommend ensuring you cross the bridge prior 8am to ensure you are in the traffic queue to clear Customs, regardless of your direction of travel, or delay your crossing until after the bridge reopens which is anticipated between 11 and 11:30am. Reopening the bridge to traffic will be dependent on how quickly the participants walking North to Canada are cleared by Canada Border Services Agency. were planning on crossing the bridge early around 5-6am, their might be a line to cross the bridge with the parade to get thru customs and after a longer line and more customs delays. It would be nice to get to happy day before late evening. We ( my wife and dog) plan on arriving on 6/29 so thanks for the FYI on the parade, we never would of thought about something like that delaying our trip. We were concerned about Mackinaw closing."
6329500,kzoofisher,2019-06-09 16:38:00,5144,"SSM to Happy Day is 5 hours at the most. Check in for the lodge is 3:00, noon for the outpost. If you're going to cross that early there are a number of scenic turn outs on Superior and a falls or two you can check out and let the dog stretch its legs. I usually leave Kalamazoo about noon and get to Wawa about 9:00 with stops for food and the border crossing. Stay the night there, have breakfast in the morning and an easy 1 1/2 hours to the lodge for the noon check in. The last 20 miles would be quicker if we weren't trailering on the dirt road, though it's in better shape than most Michigan paved roads."
