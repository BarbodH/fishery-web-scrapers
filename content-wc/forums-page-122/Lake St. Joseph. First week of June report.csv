It was a bit of work to find water above 50 degrees. But a few shallow bays were somewhat warmer and we found fish there. Plus, even a few cold water areas produced fairly well--mostly in deeper water. Toward the end of the week, things picked up and we wound up having a decent trip. Already looking forward to next year"
