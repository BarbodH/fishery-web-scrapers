Walleye fishing has very good. Consistency is the key. They were on rock points in 17' of water to begin the year, and now have moved to humps and mud both. You can fish the sides of shallow humps, or the deep water humps.... they are on both. While it might not be a bite everytime you drop the hook, there are a lot of nice ones. We're consistently catching 17-18"" (which is always our goal for keepers). Plenty of big girls being caught/released, and lots of lunch sized fish too. Pike fishing is always easy in Obabikon Lake. I would say that it hasn't been lights out, but they are still everywhere you go. A lot of small ones, and certainly entertaining. Small Mouth: if there's a fish that is too far behind, it's the bass. They're just now coming up in numbers on shorelines. They've been so deep, we were jigging them up walleye fishing last week (which is unusual for June). They were shallow yesterday, and I imagine that they're going to explode this week. Crappie have been caught in the spawning areas. For the most part, we leave them alone during this time, just to let natural reproduction happen. Muskie opener isn't going yet, but we have had several unintentional muskie incidents. They're starting to feed, which should indicate they're finishing up their spawn. I was a little worried, with opener on Saturday, that they wouldn't finish. I think that's happened and it'll be safe for everyone to go out. Perch are mixed in with the walleye... typically get schools later in the summer. Weather has been a bit of a chore. Too cool most of the time, with a couple days of insane hot. Also... WAY too much North and East winds. Very unusual."
6329920,That Minnesota guy,2019-06-11 06:03:00,8293,Thanks for the report. Hope the resort is full and everybody leaves with sore elbows and their limits!
6329924,muskyman73,2019-06-11 06:28:00,401,I like the fishing report Jared. But get those winds over and done with by the time we get there. Mother nature needs to give us a break.
6330142,Hook_settr,2019-06-11 15:09:00,127,Agreed! I always appreciate your posts Jared. Nice to keep tabs on whatâ€™s going on in the area I fish. Thanks!
6330202,FishinFreaks,2019-06-11 18:11:00,386,"Great report. I hear you on the north and east winds. The whole week we were up, right before Memorial Day, the wind was out of the east. It was weird. Made fishing a bit weird for a couple days, but then, of course, it turned on like a light switch. Total domination. Love it up in the Morson/Sabaskong Bay area!"
6330510,Obabikon,2019-06-12 14:53:00,2370,"I was just thinking... if it is this bad now, imagine how bad it will be when you guys get here! You always seem to pack extra wind!"
6330574,1100 Remington Man,2019-06-12 17:14:00,73,Nice report and makes me want to go back and fish Lake of the Woods.
