6330576,papadave,2019-06-12 17:16:00,151,"There is nothing that compares to the anticipation of my trips to Canada walleye fishing. It makes me sit back and reminisce of trips gone by. One season about eight years ago I made a deal with a lodge owner to be a free ""fishing partner"" for his guests in exchange for room and board in the staff quarters for the season. I had a blast entertaining the guests and a bunch of great stories. A father asked me if I would take out his two sons one morning mid-week. He told me the boys (8 and 10) both loved fishing and knew how to handle themselves with a rod and reel. I previously had noticed that they really seemed to be enjoying their vacation and they appeared to be very congenial around the lodge. The morning of our trip when I came out of my quarters at 6 am for breakfast the two boys were already standing on the rocks right in front of my door casting out into the lake. I have no idea how long they had already been waiting for me. They must have started casting before daylight. I felt a little guilty going up for breakfast while they were standing there but they seemed pretty content casting until I got back. It was a bluebird calm morning with bright sun and only a slight wind. We were drifting a long slopped bank with nice slow drift. They both caught fish one after another all morning on every drift. When it was getting close to noon I pulled out into deeper water to prepare our sandwiches for lunch. The older boy gobbled down most of his sandwich like a rabid dog and immediately wanted to get back to fishing. I told him to hang on because the younger one and I were only half way finished with our sandwiches. In his anxiety to get back to fishing the older boy took a piece of roast beef and hung it on his jig and then dropped it down under the boat. In only a couple seconds he cranked up a nice 18"" walleye! Soon after I released his walleye, the younger one decided to wolf down his sandwich and was now the fidgety one that was anxious for me to get back to our morning spot. The younger boy didn't have any of his roast beef left but he wanted to match his brother's fishing feat. I thought I would die laughing when he became so anxious that he grabbed a packet of mayonnaise out of his lunch bag and squeezed out a big glob onto his jig. My laughing was short lived with amazement when he dropped the mayonnaise covered jig over the side and immediately hooked a 20"" walleye!"
6330580,1100 Remington Man,2019-06-12 17:29:00,73,"One of the funniest I saw was when casting for Northern Pike the Guide doing a side arm cast had his rod hit the motor and it came out of his hand and into the water the whole works went in the lake and he went in after it reaching in time before it went to the bottom. He then told us what happens in the boat stays in the boat. Unfortunately that night he was razing one of the Guys in our party about not being a very good caster then I said, I know some one who had to go into the water to save his rod and reel not mentioning any names he got a very Red Face. Hey don't stir the pot if you can not take the heat."
6330584,Aspencreek,2019-06-12 17:55:00,2911,"Back in 2010 we had a trip for 6 planned on LS, all was well until on tues one of our guys got bad news and left for home. This left one of us without a boat partner. I volunteered because on monday night I took a 10yr old from another cabin out with me for a quick nite bite on a reef not far from camp. He was on the trip with his parents and they were really struggling to find and catch fish. I went over to their cabin and asked if it would be OK if Jr. wanted to go with me the next day and told them about the situation with my partner. Next day he was waiting at the dock, fired up. We had a great day and when we returned to camp at 5pm, dad was at the dock waiting. We had caught enough for them to have a good walleye dinner, while dad was really frustrated for not doing well. I asked him if he wanted to go out with us again at 7pm for the night bite and I would show him a few tricks. Turns out all he wanted to do was throw stick baits, somehow he got the notion that that was the only way to catch walleye in Canada. Jr and I showed him that jigging, backtrolling, slip-bobbering, etc. etc all worked too, but location is everything! When we got back to the dock, Jr asked if his mom could go along tomorrow, the look on Dads face was ""priceless"". I suggested that they just follow us around and we would show them some ""good spots"". The rest of the week was great and I got a new friend out of the deal, not to many 53 yr old guys get to make good friends with a 10 yr old. That 10 yr old is now a Freshman at Edgewood College here in Madison and plays baseball for the Eagles. He goes to Canada every year with his dad, mom unfortunately passed in 2016. I go to as many of his games as I can, and he comes over for dinner once a month during the school year."
6330600,WallyWarrior,2019-06-12 18:54:00,2488,"Last year was my boys (7) first trip up. He was given choice of what he wanted to use for bait and decided upon a 2 oz jighead with a 12 inch bass worm. Ended up tying for biggest fish of the trip and his first walleye over 30 inches. The guy he tied with also caught his first walleye over 30 inches and this was on his 60 (or so) trip, 90 years old. https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/201...669f621f2c.jpghttps://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/201...5ea1f3f995.jpgSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
6330622,Larry S,2019-06-12 20:21:00,665,"In 2014 I got my sister to finally go on a fly-in. She had been to Canada several times, but never on a fly-in. That year the ice went out a couple of weeks late so the walleyes were very shallow the week(Last week of June) we went. the fishing was excellent all week. On Tuesday we were fishing a long shallow bay ,catching lots of fish, when my sister set the jig on a fish. Her pole bent and she had a heavy fish on. As she cranked it in a walleye of some 17inches came out of the water with the jig attached to the upper lip of the walleye, attached to the lower lip was a large long bundle of mud. After bringing the fish in I grabbed the mud bundle, it was very heavy, dipping it up & down in the water to get rid of the mud. When most of the mud was gone a large sweatshirt XXL remained. As it was getting late we returned to our cabin and I spread the sweatshirt on a chair. The next morning we spread it on the patio so it would dry out in the sun. When we returned it was dry and had a faint Green Bay Packer Logo on it .As I said in the first posting on Walleye Central, this is Karma my sister, was living at the time in Wisconsin(Has since moved to Nevada with me) and is a Big Packer Fan. So it made sense that she pulled up this sweat shirt. We renamed the Bay where this was caught on Kearns Lake Sweatshirt Bay. She also pulled up a 41in Pike along with Hundreds of walleyes"
6331092,Pooch,2019-06-14 11:37:00,4618,Several years ago we had three of our boats fishing Lac Seul open water on reefs. One boat leaves for another reef ten miles off. That night they report that they lost a brand new Shimano reel on a brand new St Croix rod. The guy is heartbroken.Two days later one of our boats snags a brand new Shimano reel on a brand new St. Croix rod. Brings it back to camp that night and confirms it was the rod lost by our other boat. It was snagged and brought up on a totally different reef than the one they had been fishing so it must have came out of the rod holder over that reef.What are the odds of that?Pooch
6330646,dschiebel,2019-06-13 01:19:00,85,"My fishing partner and I flew into a lake called Lil Shab in May 0f 2018. Fishing was great, weather not so much. Anyways, the cabin sits back in a bay of the main lake, you have to really watch or you will miss the turn. So were coming back at about 830 pm, almost dark and I slowed the motor to make sure I had the right turn area. I was shining my flashlight towards shore, 25 ft away, and looking for rocks. All of a sudden my flashlight scanned the water next to the boat, and I could see a head of a white male with a beard and mustache submerged about 2 ft under water. I screamed and yelled to my fishing partner (Doc) that there was a body under water close to shore . We both panicked for a minute. We had a satellite phone back at the cabin about a 1/2mile away. We decided to try to retrieve the body and bring it to shore. I through out a buoy to mark the general spot. As we slowly went back searching for this person with our flashlight, now almost totally dark. Doc suddenly screamed Dave you just drove over him, I heard the motor hit something and the motor quits. I told Doc to get the net and see if we could catch part of the body. All of a sudden we see the head that now appears to have been hit by the motor, Doc gets the head in the net and tries to pull it towards the boat. Doc says its hung up and barely moving. All of the sudden it came loose, and Doc falls to the bottom of the boat with the head in the net flying around. After a lot of screaming and yelling, I shined my light at the head. I then realized that the head was actually a soccer ball with a life like face with ears. eyes. mouth, nose and hair painted on it. Somebody had been using it as a marker to not miss the turn to the cabin. It was probably anchored in 4ft of water, but with the high spring water it was under the water by about 2 ft.Once I new what it was I retrieved it from the net and tossed it at Doc's lap. He screamed and said swear words like a demon. I was laughing so hard I was crying and I think I wet myself. We went back to the cabin and drank a quart of brandy. So if anybody fishes Lil Shab you will see the head with a big gash on it sitting on the point where you turn into the cabin. We nick named it Billy, cause the ball resembled Bill Clinton. Doc says he will never forgive me and he is going to come up with something for a pay back, I will let you know."
6330658,HeHooksHimself,2019-06-13 05:05:00,725,"We had a similar situation about 10 years ago on the last day of a great week of fishing at Wine Lake Camp. I was in the boat with my BIL and best fishing buddy Doc and it was almost time to go in. He casts and somehow the pole slips out of his hand and splashes into the water right beside the boat. I hear the splash and he is leaning over the boat watching his pole sink to the bottom for about 10 seconds. Finally he looks over at me and says, ""we were done fishing, weren't we?"" We reminisce that moment every year."
6330712,Rondogpike,2019-06-13 07:00:00,24,"Many years ago we were on a fly-in lake north of Red Lake, Ontario. The first night in camp I woke to a full bladder and stumbled out into the pitch black of a cloudy Ontario night. As I did my business a wolf started howling very close to me. The hair on the back of my neck stood up and if I could have seen it my arc could have been used to fight a second story fire. The next day when we came back to camp we saw a wolf with 2 pups in the bay just below the cabin. Turned out the group in front of us had a bear problem. They shot the bear and drug it just into the brush in the bay. The wolves were feeding on the carcass and were there all week. We could howl to them and they would howl back. My official camp name after the first night was Pisses with Wolves."
6330766,papadave,2019-06-13 08:58:00,151,I love these stories! Thank you for sharing. It helps pass the time waiting for my next trip.
6330782,Jahloaf,2019-06-13 09:49:00,74,"I was fishing with 2 of my buddies out of Minaki back in the middle 90's. Our first time to the lake and the fishing was slow at best. I was dragging a jig n minnow when I hoked into something big. Put up one **** of a fight, and this fish was HUGE, when I looked down into the water I saw 3 heads on this fish! After a few minutes I got the fish to the top and low an behold I had caught a metal stringer on the last link of the chain. Attached to the stringer was 3 walleyes about 5 lbs each! Even though it was a slow week of fishing I released all 3 fish because they were too big to keep but its one **** of a fish story."
