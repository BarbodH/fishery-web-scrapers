6329376,the_bronco,2019-06-09 07:50:00,86,"Baitking Bait Keeper varmint (Otter) proof, the cat's meow for leeches and the thing will last forever. Reeds Sports of Walker, MN is the only place I found them. Keep the leeches at camp in a cooler with a ice chunk, change water, from the lake, once a week, what is left in baitKing throw over side of boat like minnow bucket at night and you will be fine. We take 18 pounds of leeches a year (one trip) and have had no issues. One other thing, DO not reach in leech cooler with sun screen or anything else on your hands!!"
6329410,BornToFish,2019-06-09 08:49:00,1224,"Greetings, My wife and I have done several fly-in trips. We are now going to a remote fishing lodge, which is about the same as a fly-in. The bottom line is that we only have what we bring with us. Having flexibility/choices in terms of equipment can be essential to a great trip. We have pretty much fine-tuned about everything that there is to fine-tune. Andre: I commend you for giving careful thought to your upcoming trip, as you are building self-confidence in your ability and equipment. I suspect that you will have your future trips find-tuned before too long. Make some great memories on your upcoming trip!!"
4993649,Carnhzkr,2016-07-16 08:35:00,964,"Thanks for the suggestions, guys. Sounds like I'll keep them in a tub in the fridge. I'll take a margarine container and poke a bunch of holes in it and put the day's allotment in that and keep it in the livewell. Or will they die in the livewell if they're not kept cold? If they need to be kept cold, then I'm not going to mess with 'em. I just thought it'd be a good experiment."
4993785,Jesse-WI,2016-07-16 10:05:00,534,leech bag by frabill or cabela kept in the boat livewell all week unless it is very hot.
4994049,bigdaddyguns,2016-07-16 12:19:00,608,Yeah heat is the number one enemy for leeches. Keep them in 75F water or cooler and they will be fine for the day. If they bake in the sun without insulated container they won't last long. Heat is one sure way to kill off leeches. Otherwise they are pretty tough and hearty.
6329240,andreindy,2019-06-08 13:41:00,308,"I appreciate the insight so far from this thread, but I have some continued novice questions. We are going to a fly-in July 13th for a week and I intend to bring a pound of leeches. How would you recommend I keep 1 pound of leeches alive and well throughout the week? Some additional variables: - the fridge in the cabin is very small - the cabin does have an ""ice hut"" with readily available slabs of frozen lake ice My thoughts: - fill a small cooler with lake water and added ice from ice shed to water and keep leeches in there - take what we need out into the boat in Lindy Leech Tamer bags and keep them tied off in lake Further questions: - I can return unused leeches from Tamer bags to the very cold cooler water without harm, correct? - How many leeches can you generally keep in a Lindy Leech Tamer bag hanging over the side of the boat in lake water?"
6329246,BornToFish,2019-06-08 14:07:00,1224,"Greetings, I didn't read through the entire thread to read what was already mentioned about leeches. About the only thing that really went wrong with me for leeches was adding tap water that had been treated with bleach to the leech container. They were dead within about fifteen minutes. I believe that keeping leeches cool is definitely a good thing. Rather than returning the leeches from the leech tamer to the cooler at the end of the day, you might consider just filling the live/bait well with some water and leaving the leech tamer in the live well for the evening. Assuming you have minnows and crawlers on your trip, I would think putting about one dozen leeches/angler into the leech tamer would suffice for the day. You might want to change the water in the cooler every other day or so. You will notice white whispy slime in the leech water after a day or so. You will want to get that white slime out of the cooler. I suggest keeping the cooler in the shade. Other than the aforementioned problem with chlorinated water, I've found that leeches are pretty much bullet-proof. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6329288,Esoxmike,2019-06-08 19:20:00,114,I drill holes in the lid of one of my kids airsoft bb containers.also drill holes in container for clothes line string to tie off to boat when dunking them in the lake.its the perfect size container with a good screw on lid.i just keep the rest in the container they come in when bought and keep in fridge or cooler with ice.leeches are so much easier to keep alive for a week in the bush than nightcrawlers.and we absolutely catch more on leeches than anything else
6329290,Esoxmike,2019-06-08 19:21:00,114,"Note-dont drill holes no bigger than 1/8"" or those slimy little buggers will escape!"
6329310,Aspencreek,2019-06-08 20:53:00,2911,"I have been doing this for about 10 yrs after trying to keep them in the plastic bag the come in when I pick them up. 1. I save a 1/2 or 1 gallon milk jug. 2. After purchasing the leeches I go into the parking lot and transfer the leeches into the milk jug using a funnel and the water they came in. Screw on cap. Put in cooler. 3. At camp they go into the fridge. (I had a women that was along one trip remove them from the fridge and put them on the porch, good thing it was only for an hr. I reminded her that they STAY in the fridge, they cost more per pound that her Prime Rib at home) 4. Every morning I take the jug down to the lake and will change out the water, it's not as tough as it sounds. I have a leech tamer and use that as a screen so I don't loose any. Back to the fridge. 5. Any that I take out for the days fishing is kept in the Tamer and in the lake until the next morning when more are added. 6. I lose very few during the week as long as the water is changed out and never use the tap water. This system is easy, no mess, and simple to take out as many as you need for the day. If any are left over, which rarely happens I leave them in the fridge for the next group along with any crawlers too. The crawlers that are left over are put in a gallon zip lock bag with bedding in the fridge too."
6329314,DW,2019-06-08 21:09:00,2437,"Maintain the mother load of leaches in the frig with minimal disturbance. Pre-cool replacement water and change out the old water once a day. Remove the number of leaches you expect to use during the day. Try to keep them as cool as possible, and never in the sun. At the end of the day, give the remaining leaches fresh water, put them in the frig but don't mix with the mother load. Next day remove as many from the mother load as needed, and mix with the ones leftover from the previous day. Don't dump warm leaches into cold water. Instead put the container in the frig to cool slowly."
6329364,andreindy,2019-06-09 06:38:00,308,"Thank you everyone. I really appreciate it you sharing your experiences with those of us who are newer to the Canadian club. My decision to bring leeches is a ""one month until we leave"" decision, but like other newcomers to fly-ins, I feel most comfortable having options available to me than not."
4992689,Carnhzkr,2016-07-15 17:03:00,964,"I've never used leaches much, but I'm thinking about picking up a half pound or so for some variety on my upcoming trip to Miles Bay. I feel kinda silly asking these, but I have some very basic questions: How do you keep them? I assume they need to be kept cold, so I was thinking I could put them in a Tupperware-type container and keep them in the fridge and change out the water every day or so. Do you need to poke holes in the lid? Can I just put the day's supply for the boat in another Tupperware container or will they get too hot? Can they survive temps in the low-mid 80s? Can you take them out in a regular minnow bucket and keep them in the water as you would with minnows?"
4992769,67ZL1,2016-07-15 18:33:00,277,"Keep them in your fridge if your wife will let you, if not buy a beer fridge for bait and suds. I find if you keep them at 38-45 deg they will go somewhat dormant and you can get away with not changing your water for a week or so. I use rain water or leave some lake water in the livewell and use that when I get home. As far as keeping them in your minnow bucket... Don't, they will get into the slats and between the lid and bucket. A real pain to get them out. Pick up a leech tamer or two. As far as keeping them in mid 80's temp, I think you're going to have issues. And finally I just use a plastic container with no lid to keep them in at home. Hope this helps."
4992849,Carnhzkr,2016-07-15 19:00:00,964,"Thanks for the advice. Just to be clear, I'm not talking about keeping them at home (my wife would freak). I'm talking about keeping them at the cabin where I'll be staying and then what to do with them in the boat when I take out a few dozen for a day's fishing."
4992913,67ZL1,2016-07-15 19:47:00,277,"Lol, sorry. You can keep them in your cooler in a container with a lid. I like to use about 2/3 water and 1/3 ice mixture."
4992953,BornToFish,2016-07-15 20:06:00,1224,"Another point about keeping leeches is to be certain to use lake water. If not, verify that your lodge does NOT use chlorinated (bleach) water for their camp supply. The tiniest bit of chlorine will kill the leeches in minutes. I change the water every few days, as indicated by the presence of white slime in the water."
4993009,h8go4s,2016-07-15 20:37:00,1673,Use a leech locker. Keep them in your livewell while fishing or in the lake as you would a minnow bucket. Regular fresh water changes will keep them alive. For long-term storage put them in the fridge and change the water every 2-3 days.
4993041,Moondog,2016-07-15 21:00:00,362,That leech locker is the best way to lose all your leeches. The lid comes off especially if you forget it is in the water and take off. Also comes off in the deadwell and leeches are down the tubes so to speak. Keep leeches in a container in the fridge. Freeze water in a small Tupperware container.......like half full. Change water in the fridge container and take a days supply in the Tupperware with ice and water as a previous poster suggested. Works great.
4993369,jimirjr,2016-07-16 06:08:00,1149,"I really like these ""LEECH LOCKERS"" ... Work really well in fridge or boat.. Yeah, You have to make sure You get em ""locked"" correctly.. BUT, these are the best container I have used... Even use em while I'm ice fishing for My minnow container. Just give em some fresh water every few days, as stated above..."
4993433,h8go4s,2016-07-16 06:24:00,1673,It's a easy lesson to learn. Never tow a minnow bucket or leech locker. Keep them in the boat where you can get at them easily. Dunk them in once in a while for fresh water or keep them in the live well. Leeches are tough animals and you can just run the livewell pump occasionally. The leech locker lid won't come off if you close it right.
4993473,octanehi5,2016-07-16 06:37:00,1104,"same thing applies to keeping worms keep them on the cold side.Also if the lake you fish has leeches in it as a natural food, they can be caught very easily."
