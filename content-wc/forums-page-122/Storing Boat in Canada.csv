6328472,rosh1,2019-06-05 13:42:00,275,"I take my boat up in may and bring back in oct. Its easy to get form and it doesn't cost anything. All you have to do is have numbers off boat and trailer, tell them at broader going to leave it up there. They will have you go inside and fill out paperwork."
6330138,Tony S,2019-06-11 15:04:00,8,You need your proof of ownership/registration. Paper work takes about 5 minutes and there is no cost. They allow you to leave it in Canada for 6 months.
6330380,skap,2019-06-12 09:42:00,58,Yep the above posts are correct. I leave mine most every year for a few weeks. I was in Sioux Lookout last weekend and go back middle of next week. Way easier and less wear and tear on the boat / trailer and truck. Just let the border agent know you are leaving the boat and they will have you park and come into the building. Takes 5 minutes and costs nothing. Safe travels!

6330410,bigwalleye1,2019-06-12 10:29:00,2632,"So if you're leaving your boat there, what do you do with the contents? Rods, electronics, life jackets, landing net? Haul it home?"
6330456,johnboat,2019-06-12 12:17:00,2014,I've left my boat in Canada at a friends cabin for a few months on several occasions. Nothing was said at the border while leaving without it or when I pulled it back.
