6328906,ThrillerSpeed,2019-06-07 05:03:00,5,Don't top off your tank. Know how much fuel your tank holds and fill it to about 90%. Fuel expands as temperatures rise.
6328936,That Minnesota guy,2019-06-07 06:37:00,8293,With my gas guzzling Verado I just have a tanker truck follow along behind to the lodge.
6329008,pjshorthorn,2019-06-07 10:37:00,5654,This is just great to find out a week before the trip. I thought the Verado was much more efficient than the 2 stroke E-Tech. ...... PjShorthorn
6330112,unchained,2019-06-11 13:29:00,208,"not to mention, your gas prices are probably 25-40% lower than ours, so even if you burn an extra $30 towing an extra 300 lbs (full tank on a ranger or something similar) up here, you likely saved more than that when you filled up in the US instead of Canada."
6326966,Guest,2019-05-31 13:16:00,0,There is a website crossbordershopping.ca enter the website and look up Canadian Gas Savings Calculator. This is for Canadians to see if they save money by crossing the border for gas. The exchange rate is very favorable to US at this time. US dollar is worth $1.34 to their Canadian $1.00 today. Example - Gas today 5/31/19 at International Falls is $2.69 and in Fort Francis a litre is $1.39 the Calculator shows that the Cost to a Canadian in the US is $3.63 in Canadian monies for a gallon and Cost of 1 gallon in Canada in Canadian Monies is $5.26 a savings of 31%. So if your traveling to Canada for every $100 you spend in the US on gas you save 31% or $31 for every $100 spent on gas. Ontario in 2015 Provincial Tax 14.7% and add the Provincial GST/HST TAX of another 13% That's why the baseprice in 2015 on 70 litres was $42.42 without tax and $105.89 with their taxes included. My opinion fill up in US!
6326980,Angler1700,2019-05-31 16:05:00,37,"Yes, but now with the carbon tax on our Canadian gas as well, it now means we are all saving the planet.....at least according to our government. Which can go kiss my... well you get the point."
6327094,tv4fish,2019-06-01 05:06:00,2694,I certainly agree with you.................
6327114,ogilville,2019-06-01 06:21:00,262,The US and UK are trying to solve the global plastic waste problem by banning plastic straws.
6327124,fishingfever,2019-06-01 07:06:00,85,I try to fill up in the U.S. to avoid ethanol in the boat gas as much as possible. I believe Canadian gas is required to have 10% ethanol except for some premium gas. Just my personal preference.
6327150,Pooch,2019-06-01 08:44:00,4618,While serving the drink in a plastic cup. Nobel idea thought up by the same dude that updated all the new (how can you screw that up?) gas cans.The evil fast food industry converted all of us to straws about in the early seventies. If restaurants would always serve my drink in an actually CLEAN glass I'd never us a straw. poochPS: I've never ever had a problem with 10% ethanol in any small or large engine. I've also never had a frozen fuel line since ethanol was introduced into our fuel supply. We forget that was once a problem.
6327216,v-bay gord,2019-06-01 10:48:00,3168,Bring back the paper straw.....
6327298,That Minnesota guy,2019-06-01 18:22:00,8293,We are to busy letting the paper mills go broke.
6328792,Mark R,2019-06-06 17:22:00,1538,"I never liked adding an extra 200 to 250# s to a boat already loaded with everyone’s “stuff”. The wear and tear on the tires, springs and bears was worth it. Probably just me worrying to much"
6328836,drlee,2019-06-06 19:17:00,409,"We fill up when we leave southern Wisconsin, we fill the Honda Pilot and the boat. Then, we fill up again in the US on the North Shore at the last stop before the border, this time, of course, the vehicle. After that, we us the gas at our lodge for the boat. My motor is rated very good for 10% enthanol, so no worries there. Quite frankly, when I figure in the price of gas for our drive in trip which we do twice a year, the $$ is not all that significant. I have lots of stuff to worry about without adding that to the equation."
6326802,kzoofisher,2019-05-31 03:17:00,5144,We need gas when we get to the border anyway so we fill boats and all extra tanks then. Judging from the lines at the stations I'd say the gas is pretty fresh
6326804,pjshorthorn,2019-05-31 04:28:00,5654,"I keep telling you that the Kokanee you drink is not fuel,but you keep drinking it like it is going to keep your motor running. What is the price of Kokanee per liter nowadays? PjShorthorn"
6326806,kettyspanky,2019-05-31 04:40:00,271,We always fill up at home a day before leaving. The extra weight isn't that much and I get the non- ethenyl gas I like. We do put gas in the truck just before the border and never had any issues. We always take an extra 10 gals from home as well. Then we are covered for the week.
6326808,btyreprich,2019-05-31 04:50:00,1067,"We used to bring extra gas jugs with us for the boat. One year the lodge owner politely asked us not to do this. Insurance and local fire department regulations. He said that for his guests, gas is not really a profit center and we were free to take the boat into town to fill up at the local gas station. of course we did as he requested."
6326842,Pooch,2019-05-31 06:26:00,4618,"I'm sure I'm in the minority here, but if we use the Canadian roads to drive on to go fishing, then why shouldn't we buy some fuel in Canada to help maintain them?Traveling with extra fuel cans is just not worth the risk, regardless of how minimal. I've seen dumb azz's have cans hidden in the tall grass around some cabins then one of their group forgets and backs over them. Sweet, just friggin' sweet.....For what? You saved twenty bucks on a thousand dollar or more trip? Good grief.Go ahead and blast away in order to justify your actions.Pooch"
6326848,btyreprich,2019-05-31 06:43:00,1067,"Pooch: Your line of thinking has merit. For our group we end up buying some gas in Canada to get us back home. We do buy most all of our gas in the US so as to save money. Other than the gas in our boat, we no longer bring gas jugs with us - it wasn't a smart thing to do. Even if I were to buy a pickup truck when I retire, I'd never consider putting a gas storage tank on the back of the truck. Just too scary having all that fuel sitting behind you!"
6326852,a_hershy,2019-05-31 07:04:00,36,Other than price. Is there really much difference in US or Canadian gas?
6326860,NorthernExposure,2019-05-31 07:17:00,6,"When I use Canadian gas my motor makes a noise after it is done, sounds like ""EH""."
6326946,v-bay gord,2019-05-31 11:50:00,3168,Obviously Canadian gas is better...
6326954,johnboat,2019-05-31 12:29:00,2014,I fill up before crossing. 60 gallon gas tank here.
6326638,a_hershy,2019-05-30 14:26:00,36,"Last year was the 1st time I've pulled my personal boat to Lac Seul. Looking forward to doing it again this July.For those towing their boats into Canada, I am curious to know what strategy you use when when it comes to gassing up the boat before hitting the water. Is it full when you leave home? Do you fill it before crossing the boarder? Or after at a traditional stop? Does the lodge fill it when you get there? Do you even give it a thought?Thanks.hershy"
6326640,That Minnesota guy,2019-05-30 14:37:00,8293,I'll haul a full tank because I then know it's fresh gas as the station I use pumps alot of gas. I ask myself whats a few bucks in extra gas burned when going on a fishing trip? If I can't afford to tow a little extra weight I can't afford to go.
6326642,Overwatchmike,2019-05-30 14:38:00,201,I own my cabin so I fill up when gas is the cheapest. I stop at the border and fill up a bunch of 5 gallon cans so I don't have to buy gas when I am in Canada. Only have had to pay duty on it about 5 times in the last 20 years....138 a liter last weekend. At 3.785 liters in a gallon it adds up quickly.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
6326674,brett13,2019-05-30 16:07:00,51,we used to fill up at the border and finish our 4.5 hr trip. This year we will be filling up in ear falls where our camp is so we're not hauling all that extra weight for the trip up
6326678,Obabikon,2019-05-30 16:34:00,2370,"That ends up being right about $3.80 USD per gallon. Not too terrible, but certainly more than on the US side."
6326718,bigwalleye1,2019-05-30 19:01:00,2632,"I fill the boat and truck in the falls. Finally found premium fuel a bit south of Sioux Lookout, so go there daily when we come off the water so as to be prepared for the next morning"
6326720,btyreprich,2019-05-30 19:03:00,1067,"We have always topped off In International Falls - after we have had our dinner at the Mexican restaurant in town. We have never had a problem with the gas at any of the gas stations in town. With the number of people crossing the border, each station must be pumping a LOT of gas. We dont want the extra weight on the ride up to Ear Falls. Not saying this is the best way to do things - just the way we handle it. I try to avoid buying gas in Canada if at all possible given the cost. Not always possible so in those situations we buy just enough to get over the border."
6326726,v-bay gord,2019-05-30 19:29:00,3168,Canadian gas is better than US gas... .
6326730,That Minnesota guy,2019-05-30 19:32:00,8293,Something to do with the spices when you cook?
6326752,Jesse-WI,2019-05-30 20:55:00,534,fill up at border but usually have to buy extra fuel at the resort.
