We fish later in the year, but I think in June you should be able to stay pretty close to camp and do well. The area around Lunker Point and Sawmill Bay, as well as a few of the islands in that general area should be good in June and there might be a few fish still closer to the Wenesaga River. Fish can be caught in Lac Seul using pretty much any method, but I think it fishes best with jig and minnow. I don't think jig color matters much, but I prefer bright colors just because I do. Slip bobbers can work pretty well also, and I like a leech under a slip bobber if the water is warm enough. You should be able to fish less than 20' deep and maybe much shallower. Keep trying different spots, there is sand, rock, and weeds in that area to try. If you can find a little wind blowing into a spot, that seems to help alot on Lac Seul. Good luck!"
