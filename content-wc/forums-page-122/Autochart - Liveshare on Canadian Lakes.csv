6324134,bigdaddyguns,2019-05-22 20:49:00,608,I looked over the manual and poked around the menu system on my unit and found nothing related to interpolation or extrapolation mapping control for ACL. Evidently those knobs are not exposed in ACL like they are in AC. The other interesting thing I did was download a segment of LiveShare data and see how that works with the head unit. The LiveShare data is downloaded as an already rendered layer available to display on ACL with all of its warts. The unit creates a new folder ACSOCIAL on the ZLC to hold the rendered layer data and you can select it to be displayed independent of your ACL or AC layers. There is no support in AC/ACPro for the new layer format data as of yet tho I don't expect LiveShare to ever make it into AC/ACPro.
6324160,kzoofisher,2019-05-23 03:46:00,5144,Hey! Who you calling knobs? Thanks for checking in and clearing that up. Controlling inter/extrapolation is a selling point for the programs I hadn't considered. Good to know.
6324568,bigdaddyguns,2019-05-24 07:58:00,608,"Well, we are all just knobs on the dials of life ... I want to correct the statement on LiveShare(LS) compatibility with AC/Pro. You can access LS within AC/Pro via a mode once the application is started. Maps can be generated from the LS data *however* the data is protected and cannot be modified. So you are stuck with bad data and get maps like the attached for Lac Seul with depths of 975 ft which is highly in error and no way to correct. That really limits the value of LS data to me. A couple of other advantages of LS with AC/Pro you have the ability to use the interpolation, extrapolation and custom shorelines to control contour line generation. Another complication is LS mapping on AC/Pro creates yet another layer of depth mapping information which brings the layer count to 4. Not sure the head units can manage the presentation of all four layers."
6328818,papadave,2019-06-06 18:02:00,151,Last year I did a lot of mapping with AC Live on Windermere but before I started I didn't bother to check a normal water level or set a water level offset. There aren't any chips for this lake anyway so there wouldn't be anyplace to set for normal. I know that just before I got there they had some heavy storms and the high water was just receding. When I go back this year should I go to a spot I charted last year and set it with the water level offset to match up this year and last year? When you change the water level offset on a Helix does it also change the AC Live results on the units overlays?
6329374,lawson2343,2019-06-09 07:49:00,459,"Yes to the first question. I have to do the same thing. I usually go to a flat spot in the bay where I know the bottom is constant and match up the depth using water level offset. Sorry, I don't have AC Live so can't answer that. When I may using AC Pro PC, when I import the data I use the offset value that I used on the Hbird to match up the maps."
6323620,Carnhzkr,2019-05-21 10:26:00,964,"I'm trying to understand Humminbird's Autochart / Liveshare data. As I understand it, anyone that has a Helix or Solix can record depth contour data and if they're the sharing type, they can upload that data on HB's Liveshare site so that leaches like me can then download that data for free. That sounds awesome. I'd love to get my hands on accurate depth contour data for Lac Seul, especially since for my second trip, I'll be on the east end of the lake where I've never been before. So I'm trying to decide if it's worth the considerable expense to upgrade to a Helix just for this purpose. I've registered for the Liveshare site and am looking at the map Lac Seul. First of all, there doesn't appear to be a lot of uploaded data for LS. What is there is only of portions of the NW side and from what I see, the depth data is completely wrong. This first shot is just to show a familiar spot, Manitoba Point (hopefully I can embed these jpegs). This second shot is zoomed in to the east of MP. What I see is it shows depths of 2, 3, and 4 feet, but I know this water is closer to 20 feet. It's the same story when I look at other areas I'm familiar with. The depth shown on the uploaded maps is way too shallow. Anyone have experience using the Liveshare data on Canadian lakes?"
6323644,bigdaddyguns,2019-05-21 11:31:00,608,The default depth is in the units of meters. Go to the settings gear and you can change to feet.
6323654,bigdaddyguns,2019-05-21 11:44:00,608,Oops there is a gps error here though it is so egregious it won't cause any navigational problems. More subtle errors could be problematic and leaves me with less confidence in the available data. The other danger is using the map data that has been interpolated as distance increases from actual measurements. Lakes that have dramatic depth changes may have larger errors near the ends of the interpolated ranges. Be cautious and don't put too much faith in the depth estimates off the sampled routes.
6323674,Carnhzkr,2019-05-21 12:45:00,964,"That would explain part of the problem, but where it shows 1 meter, I'm certain it's > 3 feet. I suppose the data on the Liveshare site is only as good as what gets uploaded. Being a reservoir, depth on LS can fluctuate a few feet throughout the year and I would guess that data could also get compromised based on how the users have their depth offset configured. I guess the net result is that one should use the depths as a rule of thumb and proceed with extreme caution."
6323678,lawson2343,2019-05-21 13:06:00,459,"ABSOLUTELY! The only known depths are those depths that were recorded directly under the transducer. And as BigDaddyGuns stated, all other contour lines are either interpolation between two points or extrapolation outside the width of your boat. They are guesstimates. To give you a drastic example, my extrapolation was set to 10 meters, so the track is showing contour lines out each side of the boat for 30 feet. When I drove past an underwater ledge (about 1 foot below the surface) with a sheer side, I was about 10 feet away from it in water 40 feet deep. The contour lines show 40 feet deep well out to the side of the boat. If I shared that with someone, they could erroneously go blazing through there thinking they were in 40 FOW."
6323846,kzoofisher,2019-05-22 04:11:00,5144,"Can you set the extrapolation on Live? That's something I'd like to be able to change for any spot I'm covering for detail. Totally agree on taking depths with a giant grain of salt on any body that has big swings. Natural lakes that don't have large stage changes have a higher confidence level than reservoirs, but there are a lot of reservoirs that change 10s of feet over the year. It's a very foreseeable problem. Exactly how HBird deals with inconsistent data in LiveShare is something I've wondered. Good chance they don't even bother and I'll admit I don't know what they could do about it even if they had wanted to. The maps aren't for navigation, they are useful for finding general trends in depth. But what do you do with all that data that you can't really trust if you want to add your own detailed (accurate for that moment) information? Does the mapping you're doing over write anything existing? You can do an offset before you start and recalibrate it in each new spot. It would be nice if you could do a base of the LiveShare map and overlay new info until you had collected enough common gps points to extrapolate a new map for that area. One thing for sure, any area that shows just a couple tracks of people passing through is basically unmapped and should be approached with caution."
6323882,lawson2343,2019-05-22 07:01:00,459,"So I went looking and looks like the only thing you can change is ""interpolation"" on AC Live. Here is what I found on page 9 of the AutoChart Manual, dated 4/15/14. >>> Interpolation limit. This control determines how close a point in the map has to be to measured data to be mapped. By selecting a larger value, larger areas will be filled (interpolated). This is sometimes practical as it will reduce the time needed for collecting the data - areas with flat bottom etc will not need to be sampled as closely. Be warned though, increasing the 'Interpolation limit' may give large errors far from the data points. ï‚¡ Extrapolation limit (PC only). This control determines how far from data (outside the 'interior' of the data) the map will be extrapolated. <<< I have a gen 1 Helix 7 Hbird, I don't have live. So my maps are made using Auto Chart Pro PC, where I can change the interpolation and extrapolation values. Mine are set to the minimums because I don't want to create false security. My guess is AC Live is using interpolation value for extrapolation as well. You should be able to change that value and observe your width of contours changing. Good luck and let us know what you find."
6323940,kzoofisher,2019-05-22 09:11:00,5144,"Cool. I don't remember much paperwork about Live coming with my G1 unit, I was more interested in the installation guide and operation of the head. Should go back and check if I missed a whole chapter. I'll check for that option on the head unit. Thanks."
6323966,lawson2343,2019-05-22 10:01:00,459,"I have looked in the Helix G2 and G2N Series Operational Manual and I can't find anything that allows you to change interpolation. Hopefully someone else who knows can chime in on this subject. BigDaddyGuns, any insight?"
6324118,kzoofisher,2019-05-22 20:04:00,5144,I couldn't find anything either so- BigDaddyGuns step on down! I did check a single pass track and it looks like ACL interpolates out about 100'. This track was in 10 fow so I would consider it mostly junk as the sonar was only really seeing a few feet of bottom. I was headed to an area with scattered weeds and I'll make a detailed map of that over many trips by recording every time I fish it. Too much time involved making passes a boat width apart to get solid coverage.
