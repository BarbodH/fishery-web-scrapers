I am taking my 3 sons ages 9-15 and my father in-law on a fly in fishing trip. Tentative plan is to get some groceries in Dryden and then finish the drive to Sioux Lookout. I wanted to ask anyone if they had a suggestion of a place to stop to fish, hike, explore, eat or whatever. We have the whole day to make the drive and do the grocery shopping. So any suggestions would be much appreciated!!Thanks, Harry"
