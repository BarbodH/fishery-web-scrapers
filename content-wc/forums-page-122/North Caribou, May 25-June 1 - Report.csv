Overall it was a great experience, BUT we endured a serious amount of BS getting into camp and ultimately lost two days of fishing before finally getting flown in. It wasn't the fault of the outfitter though, ultimately he went above and beyond to get our group into camp when I truly believe a lot of outfitters would have pulled the plug on the trip instead of enduring the extensive unexpected costs involved to get us in. I'm incredibly appreciative of that!We had 5 days to fish and made the best of things despite dealing with brutal cold and heavy wind at times.Walleye fishing was spectacular as usual with the biggest surprise being the numbers and size of fish we caught right in front of the camp dock. That's always a great summer spot, but I never expected it to be stacked with fish this early in the season. We caught numbers of fish between 24-27 inches! Two of the guys actually fished right from shore on the windiest of days and caught fish at will.Pike were a bit finicky, but in the end we figured things out pretty well. The last two days were especially good! Group total was 22 northerns in excess of 40 inches with the largest being a thick 451/2 inch beast that I caught.The way out kinda sucked as well as our pick up was late and we all missed our connecting flights home (well, everybody except me, I got very lucky )All in all it truly was a trip to remember despite the issues and as always I can't wait to go back!If you're interested in reading the entire tale in detail you can see it right here:https://www.canadafishingguide.net/i...bou-adventure/Cheers, Mike"

Our best gator bait was a jig/minnow or small plastic combination when fishing for walleye's.. We just could not get anything going casting normal Dr. Spoons/Johnson Silver/Mepps etc.. Next year we will have some of our trout/salmon spoons with us (Little Cleo's etc).North Caribou looks like an amazing fishery.. Thanks again for sharing.

In general smaller is better in the spring, but normally when water temps are that cold I catch my pike on unweighted 6-8"" soft plastics fished dead slow and hard bodied multi jointed swimbaits fished the same way.Glad you liked the story!Cheers"
