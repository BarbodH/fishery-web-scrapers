6274322,Limeyangler,2019-01-02 06:28:00,563,Happy New*Year all! A bit of fun to start the year from me. Our new rapidly growing kitten Moose is fitting in just fine. Just like our other cats he loves nothing more than aerating my minnows for me.VIDEOhttps://youtu.be/L9pgZyChnyg

6274480,Pooch,2019-01-02 11:31:00,4618,"I'm super careful on my work benches as we had an older cat that died and now have a new kitten (looks like yours). New kitten doesn't seem to be interested in jumping, but still keep hooks of any kind secured from her.How did you go about getting the hook out of your kitty? Any skin left on your face?!? :-)Pooch"
6274706,johnboat,2019-01-02 19:55:00,2014,Ha! Neat video. I enjoyed it.
6275120,Limeyangler,2019-01-04 06:06:00,563,I was kind of hoping he did so I could post the video as a 'cat fail' video and earn some money from his misfortunes....lol.
6275380,38bill,2019-01-04 12:24:00,331,That cat was a super cool cat. I just used the loop of fishing line over the hook and yank method. Hook came right out and the cat didn't even flinch.
