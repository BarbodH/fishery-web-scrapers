6277132,Jeler,2019-01-09 16:37:00,92,We've never had long lines of traffic at Pigeon River either. Great crossing and if you're traveling up on HWY 61 and in need of a great Pizza try here. https://www.northernontario.travel/t...izza-on-hwy-61Stop there every time we head thru the area!
6278434,hoppy63,2019-01-12 21:17:00,367,"Thanks for all the great info. I am taking my son for first trip, coming from ohio. Am thinking about heading up through michigan and coming home pigeon river. I know entering through michigan we will be traveling many more miles in Canada,(costing more for gas) but would like son to enjoy the ride/scenery along superior. Plans are not 100% concrete yet. Thanks again."
6270552,hoppy63,2018-12-20 15:29:00,367,"I have only crossed maybe 6-7 times at either the soo or international falls. I have never had an issue with agents or traffic. This year crossing at Pigeon River is a possibility. Just curious how that crossing is typically both traffic and agent wise. It is my opinion that if you have your information in order and are polite to the agents, that that should be a non issue. Also any good places to eat, stay, bait shops, groceries, gas, beer, etc. between there and Armstrong Station. Thanks for any info in advance."
6270558,Skywagon,2018-12-20 15:40:00,1106,Pigeon River is usually about the most layed back of all of them I go through.
6270560,That Minnesota guy,2018-12-20 15:41:00,8293,You are correct. Enjoy your trip.
6270662,kettyspanky,2018-12-21 04:41:00,271,I've crossed at pigeon river many times and never had any issues. Good luck.
6270706,BornToFish,2018-12-21 06:45:00,1224,"Greetings, I concur with the comments already posted on this thread. Having documentation at the ready and being courteous goes a very long way in having a favorable outcome at the border crossing. I have crossed the border several times at Pigeon River on our way to/from Thunder Bay. I recall that the border crossing is located in the middle of nowhere - not near a town/city. I recall that the nearest town in Minnesota is a fair distance away from the crossing and fairly small. The gas station wasn't open when we went though that town in the early morning. IF I correctly remember that particular trip, you might want to stop earlier to put fuel into your vehicle. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6270760,kettyspanky,2018-12-21 08:26:00,271,"If you need fuel. I would stop at the casino, which is about 3 or 4 miles from the pigeon river border crossing in Minnesota. Gas is fairly priced and lots of groceries and fishing supplies. Rydens general store is right next to the border and are open at 6am. There is a gas station there as well. I hope this helps."
6270802,HeHooksHimself,2018-12-21 10:00:00,725,"We probably lucked out, but one of our funny moments happened at the PR crossing. About ten years ago we were coming back from our first ever flyout. We had a great time and some great memories. It was just me and my BIL, we have been fishing buddies for a lot of years. The agent asked if we had any fruit with us. Well now, don't get all PC with me and forgive me for my lack of a filter, but I blurted out ""Just him!"" The agent got a little wide eyed and then chuckled and said, ""You guys get on outta here!"" I am older and wiser now and probably would just say no these days. FISH ON! Hooks PS The northern shore of Superior is a beautiful drive. I am guessing it is about 40 or 50 miles to a town of any size, but we were able to eat there. If you need gas soon after crossing the Casino/ Reservation is a good option."
6271462,drlee,2018-12-23 18:07:00,409,"We now cross exclusively at Pigeon River, after many years going across at International Falls. I really prefer PR, due to shorter wait times, laid back officers, good gas stop just short of the border at the Casino exit, efficiency of paying duty on alcohol if necessary, good clean restrooms, and plenty of parking. Story: My adult son, my 14 year old grandson, and I were questioned by the officer. He asked how much alcohol my son had; he asked me how much I had; then he looked sternly at my very young grandson and asked him how much alcohol HE was bringing across the border. Big smiles all around. Story: Going back to the US. Showed passport, then was asked to open the tail gate on my Honda Pilot. Officer was back there for a few minutes, then came to my window, smiling, said...""Hey. No problem. Just wanted to pet your dog, cause I love Brittany's."""
6271576,Bill Krejca,2018-12-24 08:30:00,6107,"Pigeon River is normally a fairly quick stop, but last year many extra officers were interviewing every vehicle while in line heading north. As we were heading south, it didn't affect us, but the line was rather longer going in to Canada. The border folks have always been professional in nature on both sides, have never had a serious problem there, but this doesn't mean that they aren't doing their task. Bill"
6277116,Stu,2019-01-09 15:43:00,472,"I've crossed there for the last 8 years and never had a problem. What time are you crossing? There is no place to eat until you get into Thunder Bay. The Neebing Roadhouse is right across from the Nor'wester Hotel right when you get into town, but they don't open until 11am. You'll be passing through Grand Marias and they have lots of really good restaurants."
