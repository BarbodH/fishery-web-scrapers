1323404,Legend115,2011-06-27 20:06:00,39,are there any folks here that come up to Manitoulin Island to fish for walleye or salmon? just curious..
1323434,Guest,2011-06-27 20:48:00,0,"Fished manatoulin island 2 or 3 times. Not a lot of success. A few walleye, some nice bass, jigged some lakers, Small pike, and lots of perch(not a perch guy) lots of people there and a lot of development. Not my cup of tea for a Canadian fishing experience though. Scenic enough, Nice ferry ride, didnt fish the big water except once and the Great lake was rough. I personnally won't go back but my best friend kept talking me into it. We now go above fort frances and enjoy much better fishing. good mluck and enjoy"
1323595,Legend115,2011-06-28 09:59:00,39,"the reason i brought this up is i've been fishing there for years. and the salmon have not been as plentiful in the last few years, but the walleye have been stable and consistently produce nice numbers and quality for me anyway. i throw back all the walleye over 3lbs. but last year the smallest walleye was 6lbs so we had to keep it. in fact we threw back three 10lb'rs, a bunch of 8's and several 6-7lb'rs. this year my fishing partner is unable to make it and going alone is not financially practical. i may consider guiding this area short term to offset the expenses. i'll keep you posted..this is one of the 10lb walleyes from last years trip.http://i39.photobucket.com/albums/e1...terwalleye.jpg"
1329196,zepdak,2011-07-13 07:14:00,1,"That is one nice Walleye.....I've been living on the island for a couple of years now and don't get out fishing as often as I'd like. Rainbow are plentiful and easily caught. I have also found one small lake on the island that produce plenty of 15-19"" Walleye but no monsters like your describing. I wonder if you can tell me if your catching them on the big water or could those possibly be Lake Manitou Walleye?"
1330321,Legend115,2011-07-15 18:50:00,39,you'll have to be here a little longer to get that kind of info outta me..lol..but my friend just returned and caught 35 rainbow up to 5lbs. no wall hangers but plenty of action! and i can tell you that if you ever get up to Lake Nipissing in the months of Jul-Sept you can catch all the 4-9 lb walleye you can handle. but you gotta throw them back..slot limit 20-40cm..yeah sucks but they are sooo easy these days..

My Dad was given a nice big boat(22' Larson Hampton) in good shape last year, and I'm looking for a fishing buddy for the summer and into fall. Be my first experience on the big water, we are located on Barrie Island facing into Julia Bay. Do PM me if and when you get this, did my x-ray training at the hospital in North Bay back in 1998, regret never having the opportunity to fish up that way."
