6210892,Mike Borger,2018-06-20 05:06:00,1554,"Well I'm not sure I'd ever use holders like that LOL! Rods sticking up in a small camp boat getting in the way. But each to their own.Anyhow that's what I figured, you were just using those to hold your rods, not troll. I use clamp on holders to troll larger baits with all the time. Not my favorite way to fish, but sometimes depending on time of year it's the only way to get big fish."
6211422,jkaup,2018-06-20 21:45:00,56,Thanks for the relies and banter! I picked up two at bass pro tonight that have a wider throat than the south bend el cheap-o's. Let you know how they did in a few weeks. Looking to troll for some lakers and always troll a few hours for big slime rockets!
6267412,andreindy,2018-12-09 08:04:00,308,My mind cannot recollect the gunwale configuration of the 14' Naden camp boats. I am exploring a rod holder or two to bring with us on our fly-in this year. Any confirmations if a tite-lok product like this would work on those Naden boats?https://www.fleetfarm.com/store/deta...xoC6dsQAvD_BwE
6267426,Mike Borger,2018-12-09 08:24:00,1554,"100% they'll work on any aluminum camp boat, that's the exact same holders I use on my fly in trips. But you'll need a couple of small blocks of wood on either side so that it clamps down firmly without slipping."
6267432,Scratcher,2018-12-09 08:57:00,170,"I used those for years, mainly trolling for lakers. In place of the wood blocks I used carpet pieces. What ever works for you but you will need something to help keep them in place."

6274694,andreindy,2019-01-02 19:28:00,308,"Just came in the mail today. Amazon for $23 dollars each. There is some weight, but they are built like an absolute tank...I have a feeling I will be passing these on to my children's....children. I have the weight to spare on my fly in, so I anticipate attaching these to the camp Naden 14 footers for some pike trolling."
6210276,jkaup,2018-06-18 18:59:00,56,We bough some el cheapo south bend clamp on rod holders for our last fly in. Once we had toted those turds 2000 miles from home we found they did not fit over the rail on the camp boats. What brand do you guys take up?
6210298,phishfearme,2018-06-18 19:48:00,1242,"I gave up on those clamp on type holders and made my own that work terrific. see photos. 1 1/4 inch ID plastic pipe, wires and a bolt. phish"
6210420,jveri,2018-06-19 05:57:00,70,We have used the titelok brand clamps on holders for the past few years with good luck. Just check that they are tight every few hours and they are good to go
6210448,spurs101,2018-06-19 06:44:00,635,"Downeasters Clamp on. Single and double clamp. Have used them for years. Large opening for clamping. Just use some anti corrosion on the clamping screw for years of easy, secure clamping."
6210552,Mike Borger,2018-06-19 08:44:00,1554,"That's what I use too.Quote: Originally Posted by spurs101Downeasters Clamp on. Single and double clamp. Have used them for years. Large opening for clamping. Just use some anti corrosion on the clamping screw for years of easy, secure clamping.Downeaster's are BY FAR the best on the market but I don't bring mine on fly in's because they're so heavy. Tite Lok's are lighter than air.I always bring a couple of small pieces of wood to use when I clamp the holders onto the gunnel. With a tiny block of wood there is never any slippage, they're tight as a rock. Without the wood the holders are never really totally tight and do loosen up even more over time."
6210556,Mike Borger,2018-06-19 08:47:00,1554,Do you actually troll with that set up or are those just holders for the rods?
6210564,jveri,2018-06-19 08:59:00,70,"Ya last time I went up I found a piece of beach wood and wedged it against gunnel then clamped the holder down. Have caught numerous 40"" pike and a few big snags as well without the holder coming loose"
6210602,Mr Ranger,2018-06-19 10:03:00,272,I have used the Down East - Salty double rod holders. Little spendy but VERY reliable and very adjustable for just about any gunnell configuration. Know a lot of musky guys that actually use these two. I use a piece of vinyl fabric to protect the boat from getting scratched. Here is the website.https://www.walmart.com/ip/Down-East...&wl13=&veh=sem Good luck.
6210624,phishfearme,2018-06-19 10:49:00,1242,"we use it only for holding the rods out of the boat. some boats - especially fly in boats - are quite small and this keeps you from stepping on your backup rods and just minimizes clutter in the boat.not sure what else you would use rod holders for - in Ontario you are only permitted to fish with one rod - do you troll with the rod in the holder?? I guess I think it's ""a tad"" more fun to fish with the rod in your hand??phish"
6210670,Mojo-NC,2018-06-19 12:42:00,1929,"One of our guys brought a couple of these (or similar) up to Canada this year and used a bungee cord to connect it to the back of his boat seat. They worked well. We always each have 3 rods with us, one set up for jigging, one for spinner or slow death rigging, and the other for casting or trolling. They were only used for rod storage while we were fishing, not for trolling.https://www.basspro.com/shop/en/bass...ition-rod-rack"
