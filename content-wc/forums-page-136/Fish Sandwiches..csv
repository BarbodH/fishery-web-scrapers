Good job i'm not one of those guys that either expects or relies on their spouse to cook for them. Not having made any supper plans myself I decided to hop on the Skidoo and get a couple of Crappie for a sammich. I know this is walleye central, but the crappy are more numerous this close to home than the walleye through the ice and you don't have to wait till its dark. I returned 20 minutes later with two nice ones and cooked up a storm. Crappie, bacon and avocado on rye and pumpernickel with home made potato chips seasoned with crushed peppercorns and rock salt....YES. Only problem was I only got half the sammich as the wife and kid returned and I left half the meal to them on the kitchen table and fled for my life! VIDEOhttps://youtu.be/0ynA7XyvvlA"
