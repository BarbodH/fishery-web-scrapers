Unless a family member or close friend is afflicted by this terrible disease; we don't or can't understand the devastation it renders to the patient, as well as their family. I was very moved by the personal comments in other posts, of family members and close friends that fought this disease. I too, lost a sister-in-law to this disease, and the pain it has brought to our family is difficult to put into words. With my deep appreciation to you, for sharing so well your recent late night experience at the hospital. Faith, Family & Friends, Rich B"

5942202,andreindy,2018-01-11 19:54:00,308,"To all, I am thankful for every one of you. We are this amazing community (who fishes), but as the posts attest to, we are bound together by deeper meaning, as well as shared losses, defeats, grief, joy and triumphs. What a grand adventure life is...and I am thankful when I am reminded of that. Sometimes it's subtle. And sometimes it's a dying, wonderful old timer saying ""Get out there. Feel the sun. Enjoy...and catch one for me."" Peace."

6278542,andreindy,2019-01-13 10:17:00,308,"I work in healthcare and I recently had another experience with an older man that was impactful and may resonate with some of you. Sometimes I enter a patient room and encounter men (and women) with their head bowed, shoulders and arms drawn in. Like their body is withdrawing into itself. Stillness is everywhere in the room. But it is the vacancy in their eyes; an emptiness in their ""cup"". It feels like sadness and distance and worry to me. And so it was not long ago when I encountered a man who needed assistance for things and functions that you and I largely take for granted. He was physically there in front of me of course, but at the same time, he wasn't there. Lost. I knew the work I needed to accomplish with him would not be comfortable. His dignity, his esteem, his sense of self were at risk. It is then that I need to create safety. As I began my work, I took the leap: ""You like to fish?"". He makes eye contact with me for the first time. ""Yes. I did"", he says. Seconds of silence pass, then ""Nestor Falls. Best time of my life."" And just like that, the Bridge to Safety is now under construction. ""You've been to Ontario? Me too. Greatest time of my life also"". We walked the bridge together and talked of smallmouth, walleyes, crappies and bad boat motors. We also talked of the Dads who went with us. While I worked, Canada kept this hurting man safe. When I was finished, I thanked him for his time and his stories. We shook hands with the unspoken recognition that we were both members of the brotherhood. And then I left. I want to thank all the Dads or Uncles or friends who helped provide the opportunity for others to experience Canada or the remote reaches of wherever you live. In particular, I would like to dedicate this post to the Dad that took the man in my story to Nestor Falls many years ago...I took care of your son and you did good."

5934770,wallydave,2018-01-07 19:14:00,2151,"I too work in a hospital, pastoral care, like Andreindy tells a true story. Alzheimer's and dementia rob people of short term memories, people often live in their past, bringing up memories from their past can open a door into who the person was before time and the disease process robbed them of who they are. Bringing up a topic like fishing can help them to relive cherished memories of the good old days! Anytime we can open those doors we can look into the best days of their lives. If they can have those days again even for a while, that's time well spent in my book!"
5934914,dschiebel,2018-01-08 01:46:00,85,"I remember sitting by my grandfather's hospital bed as he lays dying. The minister came, relatives from all over came. Grandpa would just lay there staring off like he had for about a week. Grandma had brought some old pictures from home and placed them on the bedside table. I stated to my Grandma ""look at this one, its got to be 30 years ago, duck hunting on Rice lake out by Savage, Minn. Me ,grandpa. 8 mallards, 2 teal and that dam goofy chesapeake dog , Trigger"". It was like somebody turned a switch on, Grandpa smiled and starting talking for about 15 minutes about that trip and the day he shot a triple on bluebills. Towards the end of the conversation Grandpa smiled and with tears in his eyes stated"" that dam dog, trigger best hunting dog in the midwest, god I miss him so"". Grandpa died that night of alzheimer's holding that picture of that dam chesapeake, Trigger."

5934930,ogilville,2018-01-08 04:02:00,262,Thank You. This brings back memories of fishing with my Father who passed away after his battle with Alzheimer's.
5935034,BornToFish,2018-01-08 06:22:00,1224,"Greetings,I can sincerely say that I would never have thought of the message in the original post. Purely in hindsight, I can say that I wasn't surprised either.I find that I sometimes have trouble falling asleep at night, especially after having a ""bad"" day. I find that I can often get to sleep by thinking about pleasant memories fishing with my wife or other friends. These memories take me to my ""happy place"" so that I can fall asleep.I mentioned this to a good friend. He reported that he does the same principle, but in a slightly different way. He said that he dreams of boating to one of his favorite fishing spots in the lake for the evening walleye bite. He starts out his dream in the boat at the dock. He then travels past an island, and then another island, and so on. He is asleep by the time he gets to his fishing spot.I appreciated the earlier post about remembering good friends, family members or other relatives through these fishing-related memories. This thread reminds me of the old Clint Black song ""State of Mind"", with lyrics ""melodies and memories"". The melody of a song often has a pleasant memory associated with it.Many sincere thanks to Andre for the original post - very inspirational!!! Posts like this separate Walleye Central from other forums."
5935570,labsrus,2018-01-08 10:10:00,557,"Wow, great post and well written, thanks for sharing. Like others, my dad had this terrible disease and we suffered thru it many years ago. Now my sisters husband is struggling with his memory. We visited over the Christmas break and enjoyed sharing some great memories. His is the one who got me into fishing many years ago, in the 1960's, we caught a few sheephead in the Niagara River. I can still feel the fight they put up. When I see him soon, we will discuss fishing and hunting. Thanks"
5936786,lassh,2018-01-08 20:21:00,553,Moving post. Thanks for sharing. Perhaps some of us will take a lesson of compassion when it comes to finding a channel of communication and comfort with those afflicted. I am glad you are in the health care profession.

5937242,emma17,2018-01-09 08:06:00,436,"Thanks Andre, As with other readers, your post brings very personal memories to mind. As a child I lived with my grandmother. Her sister had a resort up in Northern Minnesota near Squaw Lake. Every summer she'd load my sisters and me into the Greyhound bus for two wonderful weeks of fishing and outdoor play. I have so many memories of fishing with her, including her insistence that the surest way to catch a fish was to quietly repeat the words ""here fishy fishy"". Her love for fishing and the peace of being on the water is what led me to start bringing my sons up to Canada six years ago. It's the highlight of our year. She died of complications from dementia, with all of us at her side. We think of her all the time, but especially when we are on the water. I will remember your advice to ask the great question ""did you ever catch a Walleye?""."
5934042,andreindy,2018-01-07 13:31:00,308,"If you do not mind, I wanted to share an experience I had recently. It is one that has repeated itself with varying people (afraid, angry, alone or dying, young and old), varying nights, varying bedsides or tables or hallways for years. I share because maybe you have experienced it yourself with someone with dementia or if not, still believe what I will share to be true. I work in a hospital and I often encounter people with Alzheimers (or other altered states of mind) in the most fragile moments, sometimes the most potentially volatile, anguishing moments when their faculty's ability to render fact from fiction, safe from not safe, are painfully compromised. Meanwhile, we are tasked with trying to deliver medical care, IVs, antibiotics, treatments. All the scientific stuff...which is often impatient. Science does not like waiting for the man or woman who is combative, uncooperative, disoriented and taking too much time. The science is stressed when people think they are in places that they really aren't. The science is challenged to see the trembling, the isolation and the fear. In many of these moments with men who are lost, I pause the science and ask them a very simple question, You ever catch a walleye? I have learned that someway, somehow, the memories of bygone adventures find a way to withstand the ravages of this terrible disease; they find a way to imprint deep. And I have learned to fish for them. Which brings me to the other night. 3AM. My staff call me at home. A lot going on. My wife is angry, but I know I need to go in and I do. Shortly after I encounter HIM. A hurting, wounded man in a chaos of cognitive and scientific shrapnel. It's time to pause the science: I ask him. In the dark of the night, he whisked me to Minnesota river banks in the 1930's with his brothers. Talked about a father that could not swim (and an Uncle too), homemade cane poles, mothers yelling about the mess, and carp fishing. By God, if you got one on you were quite lucky to get the fish in. But if you DID, it meant a nickel from the fella who lived down the street. He smoked them, you see, and if you let yourself, it was kinda good. We talked about failed motors on big water and some trips with Army buddies. After a while, he turned to me (I really can still see the moonlight twinkle in his eyes) and whispered Ahhhh, those memories. They are such good ones. Thank you. And then he fell asleep. I just walked on hallowed ground. I remember showing a picture to one particular aged man who had lost command of most everything, including the ability to speak. I placed in front of him a picture of myself and my son beaming over a smallmouth we had fooled on a northern Wisconsin lake. He extended his arm to the picture and with a frail bony finger tapped the picture, locked eyes with me, nodded his head and smiled, knowingly. Deeply. Not a word was said and didn't need to be. We spoke the same language. I apologize for appearing dramatic, but there is a powerful magic at work there on the water and in the wind, trolling, jigging, with others or alone, laughing, cursing, trying to find where you set down the pliers, or being simply in complete silence. The cliché of making memories is real. I am thankful for past adventures, like all of you are, and any adventure I am fortunate enough to someday pursue. My 2nd time to Canada is coming in July and Abamasagi awaits my father, brother, nephew and I. My wife relented and understands that those times, those glorious glad-to-be-alive times are like a 401K investment for the soul. And you never know, someone may some day whisper to ME in the dark of the night, You ever catch a walleye? .right when I need it most. Peace."

So many old folks, my late father especially, seem to have a backed up reservoir of stories lined up waiting for an opportunity to flood the air with days of long gone. Before cell phones, and even TV, it was not uncommon to ask ""Gramps"" to provide tale upon tale of how it used to be in the great outdoors. Not so much today. Bill"

Whether for the style in which it's written for the spoken message, or perhaps for the unspoken one. Perhaps as a gentle reminder to us all to think about our own memories, reconnect with them once in a while, lift a glass to those who are part of them, perhaps now only in spirit, and smile just a little...and maybe tear up slightly..."
