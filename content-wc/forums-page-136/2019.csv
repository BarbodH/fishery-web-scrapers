6274040,v-bay gord,2019-01-01 09:58:00,3168,"I'm going with the ""dynamic personality"" concept. Now this is a perfect example of why WC doesn't want you to be able to revise your posts. It's just so much dang fun to let them hang there in all their ""hair trigger"" glory! Thanks and I look forward to your WTF flair..."
6274042,maddogg,2019-01-01 09:59:00,178,May God pour love and care on all of you. Happy New Year.

6273828,v-bay gord,2018-12-31 16:24:00,3168,"Johnboat started a thread about treasuring your friends, and while I would like everyone to have a Happy New Year and an outstanding 2019, let's not lose sight of what is really important. Friends , family and good health to all... ...the rest is insignificant."
6273832,johnboat,2018-12-31 16:31:00,2014,"Amen, Gord. We're all in this thing called life together."
6273834,Overwatchmike,2018-12-31 16:31:00,201,"Couldn't have said it better myself! Made some really good friends from this site and all the news, info, and jabs that go along with it......HAPPY NEW YEARS to all!Sent from my SM-G955U using Tapatalk"
6273888,v-bay gord,2018-12-31 20:49:00,3168,"O.K....a hundred and twenty two views and only two people can reply to a ""happy new year"" post? WTF is wrong with you people? Too lazy....don't give a sheet? Just wondering about the dynamics of the site.....apparently full of WTF's...."
6273894,That Minnesota guy,2018-12-31 21:01:00,8293,"As a Viking fan I just came to. HAPPY NEW YEAR! Good health & prosperity to all my WC friends. Lord Gord, we will be seeing you this summer."

6273910,Hidden Bay Lodge,2019-01-01 02:55:00,12,A happy and health New Year to one and all.
6273912,pjshorthorn,2019-01-01 04:07:00,5654,"I think it has to do with one of three things since you only allowed the thread to percolate 4 hours before your WTF mode kicked in. - Could be your dynamic personality and positivity on the site - Could be that people actually did have to work on Monday morning. - Could be that everyone was already in party mode and had passed out before the WTF went off in your head. My New Years resolution is to harass the heck out of you in 2019 with a WTF flair never seen before...... BTW, Happy Freaking New Years now that it is actually a new year......see you before you know it.......Call the flamingo police now......Bawahahahaha PjShorthorn ( aka Mr Arsehead )"
6273916,Hot Runr Guy,2019-01-01 05:12:00,16061,"Not to pile on, but I did not equate your title of 2019 in the Canada forum to = a ""Happy New Year"" topic. Maybe actually indicating Happy New Year in the General Discussion area might have got more views? Happy New Years to you Gord, as well as all of WC. HRG"
6273918,tv4fish,2019-01-01 05:18:00,2694,"WHOA there, big guy.............. A lot of us are Vikings fans ""down here""..........AND after that ""game"" we're NOT a happy bunch.......... Regardless - Yes, you ARE correct - we all need to take stock in what IS really important -Family - Friends and our health. Let's hope 2019 is a good year for everyone."
