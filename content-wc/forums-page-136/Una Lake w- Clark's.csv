6271892,Jeler,2018-12-25 10:32:00,92,"Merry Christmas Everyone! Here's the best to you all!My wife and I are thinking about doing another Fly-in next year.We've heard many good things about Clark's and are interestedif anyone has fished or have experience on Una Lake. From doing a search here I really didn't come up with many post regarding this lake. Lots of dangerous rocks to avoid and good fishing, but that's about it!Any help would be appreciative!We hope everyone has a joyous Christmas and a wonderful New Year!Thank youJeff & Anne"
6271946,pete kraft,2018-12-25 14:07:00,28,"From what I understand, the portage lake is not accessible because of the low water levels. If I were to fish it, I would want to be able to get into the portage lake, as Una itself is not that big. Clarks are at the All Canada show coming up if you are able to attend."
6271948,prov1800,2018-12-25 14:18:00,5010,"Definitely be a good choice to choose any of Clarke's outposts.ive had the pleasure to fish 3 of there lakes (upper wapesi,pusher and and anishinabi).all three were amazing as was the cabins and equipment three minnows they brought in every couple of days.they have reports every week in the summer of how folks have done during there stays.just go to Clarke's resort.com.its either there or the blog. Upper wapesi and pusher were fantastic for walleye and pike."
6271950,prov1800,2018-12-25 14:20:00,5010,Sorry for the bad spelling.that was meant to say.free minnows.lol.
6272006,Da' Walleye Assassun,2018-12-25 19:45:00,358,I went to Una two years ago. Rockiest lake I've ever fished. Healthy walleye population with an occasional decent pike. The portage lake has smallmouth and some nice pike. The cabin was one of the nicest I've been in. Unlock the outboard and keep the throttle speed slow and you'll be fine.
6272104,Jeler,2018-12-26 07:38:00,92,"Pete-Unfortunately the closet ""All Canada Show"" is 250 miles away. So we'll no doubt pass on trying to attend.Thank youProv1800-deciphered your original spelling just fine. Thanks for the info.Da'Walleye- Good to know about the rocks, never in much of a hurry to find fish and a slow throttle speed is just up our alley!I'll drop Clark's an email and find out the availability on Una.Thanks again everyone"
6273536,MikeinMN,2018-12-30 19:48:00,190,"I fished Una last mid-June. I would say the walleye fishing was excellent. Clark's provides free minnows and Wayne cautioned us that jig and minnow as the way to go, but I prefer to troll and cast, and did as well as I wanted trolling and casting. Caught few pike in Una, but Curie Lake, which is a portage lake from Una, supposedly has good pike and smallmouth fishing. The water is too low to use the Brokenmouth River portage, but Curie is an easy walk over the hill, gas, boats, and motors are there already. Una is incredibly rocky, we left the motor on tilt and trolled everywhere we went and caught fish along the way. West of the cabin was better than East for us, and there is an exposed shoal not far out in front of the cabin that had fish on it consistently. There is a map on fishingoutposts.com, but there are way more hazards than it shows. Very scenic lake with lots of islands. The cabin was more like a Minnesota lake cabin than a fly-in outpost cabin to me. Couldn't believe the flush toilet, and big new Honda generator for electricity, with an electric refrigerator too. Clark's brought ice with the minnows also. We would absolutely have gone to Una again this year, but just for variety booked Antenna Lake with Clark's."
6273580,Jeler,2018-12-31 04:40:00,92,MikeExcellent post and photos. Sounds like a no-brainer for a great place to spend a week fishing and relaxing! Catching lunch or dinner in Una whether by jigging or trolling will be a relative easy task according to everything I've read and you've informed us on.Thanks againJeff
6274288,kona77,2019-01-01 21:03:00,236,"You will have a good vacation with the Clark's. I have not fished Una but have fished four other lakes with the Wayne/Karla. They provide great service and always have their cabins, boats, motors in good condition. We will be on our 5th different lake this year the Clark's and are looking forward to another great trip"
6275454,Jeler,2019-01-04 15:07:00,92,Thanks to everyone for your help. Just booked a week at Una Lake August 29-Sept 5th.Hopefully the fish will be biting and the bugs will be slowed down by then.
