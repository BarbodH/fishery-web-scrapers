I've looked a their website, but it is pretty stale with a lot of old information and no updates as to the camps and base fly-out.This was always one of the premier fly-out operations and we fished with them many times over the years. Always a first class operation IMO.Anyone fishing with them anymore? Camps maintained? Camp boats?Just curious as I wouldn't mind fishing Birch Lake once again, but don't want to walk into a used up camp.Pooch"
6272470,Golden Eagle,2018-12-27 11:36:00,2642,Superior Air bought their flying service. Not sure about the camps. Superior is doing a good job and are about the only flying service in Red Lake.

The entire service was owned and operated by the Carlsen's for 40+ years. This last offseason it was was purchased by Vito Tarantino. He has done a fantastic job with revitalizing Viking Island. I believe he is up to 5-6 planes.Maybe look at their outposts?Viking Outposts - https://www.vikingoutpost.comThanks,Brett"

The fish cleaning house was kind of in rough shape, but that doesn’t bother me. They have a shore lunch spot set up with benches, a fire spot, and a fish cleaning table. We stayed in the cabin to the far right of the camp if you are looking at it from the water. We requested that one as it is kind of off by itself and had its own dock for more of an outpost feel. Green’s no longer operates it’s outpost cabin on the eastern side of Birch."
