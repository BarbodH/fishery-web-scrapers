This week was no different and so i decided to stitch together 4 or so sessions from this week into a video. Trout opened on Jan 1st but I only made it out at the end of last weekend, its a long video but pretty fun.*VIDEOhttps://youtu.be/915vW-OBH7w"

6277842,billy weaver,2019-01-11 11:09:00,470,I enjoyed the video and was impressed how you could ID the species before you could see them. The speed of the fish striking the lure (sauger vs crappie) and where it was laying will make me pay more attention to my locator. PS. Did you get your part for your auger?

6277916,BornToFish,2019-01-11 13:50:00,1224,"Greetings, Limey: Thanks for sharing the videos! I noticed that you were targeting whitefish in your video. I very much enjoy fishing for whitefish through the ice on my home-waters in Wisconsin. Unfortunately, we don't have many of the humpback whitefish that seem to be so common in Ontario. They are spirited fighters! We fish for whitefish with a lure/jig of some sort - just as you did in your video. We add a slider hook above the lure/jig. To do this, we pass our line through a small treble hook or #8 single hook. The line then goes through a small and colorful plastic bead. The line is then tied to a small swivel - the smallest you can find. We then run a dropper line (10 inches or so) from the swivel to the lure/jig. We tip the lure/jig with a piece of bait (minnow or grub). The slider hook is tipped with a grub or soft plastic. Our whitefish are ""curious"" fish. We can watch them on our sonar unit going back and forth between the lure and slider jig. It's kind of like using a piece of string to tease a kitten. There are days when all the bites come on the slider hook. This set-up should be legal in Ontario. If it is, give it a try! Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6278644,Limeyangler,2019-01-13 17:34:00,563,"This is why I use my fishfinder in graph mode. The history gives you so much more information than a straight line moving up and down, or should I say round, on a flasher. I can even tell by fluctuations in the fish mark when it is about to move for my jig, I call it ""turn head orange' as it means you have managed to turn the head of a fish from looker to taker. I also have something I call 'attack angle', to describe the angle in the history aan attacking fish makes as opposed to one that is merely interested. I don't like flashers....lol.Quote: Originally Posted by The tankLove your videos Limey!Thanks once again tank, appreciate the replies buddy.Quote: Originally Posted by BornToFishGreetings, Limey: Thanks for sharing the videos!

I love your analogy of kittens, very like that. Just got off the ice 20 minutes ago and we were marking a large fish for about an hour in more than one hole. The guy I was with was asking why a walleye would spend so much energy checking out bait but not taking. I suggested the fish in question was probably the same fish just checking out all the lines, and that it was probably a whitefish. Sure enough 5 minutes later a set line goes and there it is, a whitefish, after that the mysterious BIG mark vanished for the rest of the evening. I do use a similar method to the one you describe for ice out crappie but for the whitefish on the lake in the video they seldom hit a dead stick line, and because I like to fish in the open, what with line freeze and what have you that sounds like a pain in the u no wot....lol...but I will for sure give it a try when I', in my shelter or on the lake I went to tonight where they do hit a static line. Thanks for the tip!"
