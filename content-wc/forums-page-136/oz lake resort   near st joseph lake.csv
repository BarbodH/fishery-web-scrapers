5215130,Guest,2016-12-02 15:27:00,0,It is a river but would hardly know it. Plenty of bays and islands- twists; turns; large openings into lakes. It is very beautiful. It is very rocky. You really have to go slowly in spots. The owners are great. This is a great place to go for a reasonable and excellent price. Again- it is a-lot of walleyes. Do not go here if you are looking for large northerns.It is not much more than 15-20 feet at deepest. Greg

5169017,Guest,2016-10-26 03:53:00,0,fellow fishermen have a group of senior fishermen out of Chicago interested in fishing this resort in early September talked to owner yesterday very good price and facilities ;28 miles of shoreline with many bays and islands;has anyone fished and stayed at lodge recently we mainly fish 75% walleyes and 255 northerns she claims 25 walleyes/man/day is reasonable what has your experiences been any large northerns ??? jim wolf the Chicago boys
5188321,Guest,2016-11-06 17:26:00,0,"I have stayed at Oz Lake Motel and fished Oz Lake over a dozen times. IT is great fishing- especially if water is higher. Worse case should be 25 walleyes per person per day up to 75-100. Walleyes, 16-24 inches. Not many small ones but not many big ones either. Not large walleyes or northerns, but plenty of numbers. I like that you do not have to travel long distances to spots and is sheltered fishing as it is a fairly narrow river system."
5190930,Guest,2016-11-09 05:53:00,0,"dear sir thanks for information the owner states 28 miles of shoreline does it have many islands and large bay?? or is it a river system with a just a straight ""canal like structure"" like when we fished little river camp on English river very disappointed any northerns 35"" + thanks again for your great response jim wolf Chicago boys"
5196290,fldoc1,2016-11-15 09:21:00,69,"The people that own Oz Motel are connected to, own a resort on Lake St Joe. Lake St Joe is big (80 miles long) with the resort and good fishing closer to the landing. The lake gets little pressure and the landing is fine and only a few miles from the motel. We stayed at the camp twice and the owners were super. In the past they rented mostly 14 ft boats with 10hp motors. There is nothing wrong with the boats but the small motors make it more difficult to explore the 80 mile lake. They can pull them up on shore (wood pallets) if the weather threatens. I now have and 18 ft Lund and the way the resort is laid out there is no protection for the boat with a big storm. It is a boat in resort so taking the boat out at night is not much of an option. We would go back especially if I had a smaller boat that I could pull up when weather threatens. Randy from Duluth"
5196322,Lovetofish,2016-11-15 10:18:00,458,"Sorry, I can't help on your specific question, but I have for many years fished Pashkokogan and those lakes to the south that flow into OZ via Pashkokogan River. I suspect OZ would have similar fishing and not a lot of pressure. We catch plenty of 16-22"" walleye. And although I don't target them, I have hooked a couple 40"" class northern. Hope to be back up there next season if that helps."
5196841,Mike Borger,2016-11-16 03:19:00,1554,Jim I'm constantly researching new lakes and would be lost without this website. You can zoom right in on any part of Canada and get a clear picture of any lake. There's also measuring tools so you can determine the size:http://atlas.nrcan.gc.ca/toporama/en/index.html
5196873,Guest,2016-11-16 03:55:00,0,"mike and two other fellows who gave input on oz lake resort thanks again definitely plan on going either early june of early September lot of water, remote, and good owners jim wolf Chicago boys"
5198042,BELKER 1,2016-11-17 07:09:00,16,"Wolf i have never fished oz lake, but i think you guys would be much happier fishing lake st.joe. We stay at camp lake st.joe and have caught all the eyes and northrens that we want. They will be at all canada show at pheasant run in the chicago area. Go talk to them and then decide. They have a great fish fry on wednesday afternoon. Ed"
5199354,Guest,2016-11-18 09:41:00,0,"dear sir I actually want to go to camp st joe resort but the rest of group think its too expensive I personally think about $700 for week is not bad (all of us are retirees) so I suggested oz lake resort for about $475/week please tell me your experiences on lake st joe (I have read its a great fishery can a fisherman catch 25 walleyes/man/day are fishing consists of 75% walleye fishing jigging and trolling and 25% northern fishing casting and trolling do we have a reasonable chance of getting 3-4 40""+ northerns for the week?? could use this as information to convince them to spent the extra money and go to lake st joe resort thanks for help jim wolf Chicago boys"
5200394,fldoc1,2016-11-19 14:00:00,69,"We went twice to Camp Lake St. Joe. (2008-2010) See my first post above. We have a special place in our heart for the lake and hope to go back someday. We went in July and August. They had lower rates for August so in 2010 we went for $550 for the week. We did better in 2008 - 6 fisherman catching 800 fish (326 northerns) but better weather. We learned that ""fishing the wind"" was the key. The fish would move locations depending on the wind with a west wind being best. In 2010 we had 4 of 6 days with an Easterly wind and one super ENE windy, cooller, hard rain day. Each day we caught 30+ inch northerns with a 38"" being the biggest. Most of us fish walleyes but one in our group can't stand jigging so cast all day and that increases the number of northerns we catch. We also went further down the lake in 2010 finding more good walleye spots but using valuable fishing time traveling with the 10 hp motors. One option I think you have if you stay at Oz is to fish Lake St Joe. There is something about number of non-Canadian fisherman that can be on the lake each year so you would need to check on this. We have not gone back because a few in our group think $700 is too much. The lake has only 2 main resorts but there is a 3rd option run by Winoga Lodge. They have a cabin about 25 miles down the lake. They charge around $1000 for an 8 day trip but you are in the prime fishing area and I could bring my 18 foot lund as there is protection from the wind. We hope to go there someday but they would like at least 6 fisherman. Randy from Duluth"
