Pretty sure they use Mattice Lake Outfitters to fly their guests in, so are likely a bit more stringent on weight. That's really a question for the outfitter though.Whiteclay is awesome. I prefer the other end of the lake where MLO's camp is, but I doubt you could go wrong. River flows in at that end, the pool below the rapids is always a hotspot."
