It is the perfect combination of remote, but not crazy remote. Walleye, pike, smallies, perch and lake trout are all abundant. If you go in the spring, you will have the opportunity to hook into monster lakers trolling crankbaits in 10 to 15 fow. I caught a 49 incher last May. No indoor plumbing here, but solar powered lighting, propane stoves and refrigerators and a very nice shower house make the accommodations very comfortable. Prices are reasonable but not really cheap. Our group has had four to eight fisherman every year but two since 2000. Nick has been the owner for three years and has made some very nice changes with a camp that was already awesome. Check out this video from 2012 (we are not all that tech savvy but had a guy this year who wanted to make a video with our pictures). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY9EtnpYNIoHere is their websitehttp://winelakecamp.com/If you need more info, feel free to PM me.Fish ON!the 40 incher: https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?f...type=3&theaterHooks"

6271554,Stu,2018-12-24 07:46:00,472,Wabaskang Lake might be ideal for you. It is a chain of five lakes and has all of the species you're looking for (except crappie). There are several resorts to check out.https://www.tallpinescamp.com/http://www.peffleyscamp.com/http://www.wabaskangcamp.com/http://kingfisherlodge.com/
6271568,Bill Krejca,2018-12-24 08:21:00,6107,"Being ""of long tooth"", I have had a number of favorite places over the years. My experience/observation has been that favorite turns out to be but temporary. My north woods favorites' attractiveness seems to tend to diminish over the years. This can be due to over fishing, over population, changing laws, biology, or, perhaps most noticeable- over netting. Also, much longer drives can tend to be less tolerable. My advice in finding a great place is to enjoy it where it is still great, but keep in mind that it may be necessary to occasionally find a new favorite if continuing to enjoy the fishing pastime. Bill"
6271960,prov1800,2018-12-25 14:41:00,5010,"Actually which lake or lakes are you talking about Bill.iam finding the lakes I fish in the vermilion bay area have just been getting better.there are exceptions.not that the fishing is getting worse but notice that lac suels big fish are harder to come by by that I mean the 28-30"" ones.Also eagle lake has the big fish but also hard to come up.could be all of the above as you mentioned but on a whole fishing is really very good."
6272208,IAranger,2018-12-26 11:46:00,352,Many Thanks for all the great comments and info
6272234,billy weaver,2018-12-26 12:56:00,470,"I can recommend Peffley's Camp on Wabaskang Lake (north). There are so many good lakes and camps in the Ear Falls area that many could be recommended. Wabaskang is a series of five lakes connected by a narrows. I have been going to Peffleys long before Dave Peffley bought it. (30years). It is a boat in camp in which we use our own boats. Parking is provided at the south end of the lake near Perrault Falls. The lake is nearly 20 miles long with many coves and bays so in 30 years I can find new places to fish if I desire. I have been taking my son and grandson with me along with friends and look forward to the trip every year just like it was my first year. My grandson's first year was 11 years ago when he was only 6. Is the fishing the best in the area? I don't know, but it is good and I like a little bit of a challenge. Take a look at is web-site. P.S. The price is right."

6263962,IAranger,2018-11-28 15:53:00,352,"I am still searching for that perfect legacy maker place to go to a time or 2 every year and take kids/friends/grandkids etc. My goal is to find that special place the kids and grandkids can all return to and fish after I am gone and pass it on to their kids etc. I have been to numerous areas of LOTW, Eagle Lake, Dinorwic, Thaddeus, and a few others including fly ins. Some the fishing was not great, some are just too spendy. What I am trying to find is the economical place that everyone can afford with great fishing and decent accommodations (mainly good beds, indoor plumbing.) I would prefer drive in access to bring my own boat. We fish for Walleye, Northern, Bass, Musky, Perch, Crappie, even a little Lake Trout. Anyone have that sweet little place on a medium sized lake that has good sized fish and is easy to fish all summer and even in the wind ? Never hurts to dream !!!!"
6263980,NARDA 1,2018-11-28 17:19:00,636,Sent you a PM.
6264084,pjshorthorn,2018-11-29 05:47:00,5654,I would consider Vermilion Bay Lodge on Eagle Lake. It has everything you are looking for including 3-4 portage lakes to fish if you are inclined to take an adventure. I have fished the furthest portage lake and the smallmouth fishing was off the hook so to speak. Have fun searching for fishing nirvana. PjShorthorn
6264102,MrSimon,2018-11-29 07:45:00,922,It's awesome that you are trying to build those memories that will last for generations. Don't over-think the location though. Just about any of the hundreds of boat-in camps in Ontario are perfect for making memories. My best memories as a kid were made at a crappy road-side camp that I'd never go to today .... but to a kid it was heaven on earth.
6264116,IAranger,2018-11-29 08:32:00,352,Thanks for the suggestions I will check into them Jeff
6264134,phishfearme,2018-11-29 10:00:00,1242,kinda on the more expensive end but this place is a family paradise - incredible fishing and a taj mahal cabin:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...ht=kearns+lake two other reports are also available - just search kearns lake phish
6264214,IAranger,2018-11-29 15:51:00,352,Sounds like fun but way too far to drive 900 miles from here need something in NW Ontario Thanks Though
6264382,prov1800,2018-11-30 06:02:00,5010,Definitely check out Clarke's northern lights resort on cedar lake.seems it has everything your asking for.i spent a number of days there every season.its mid sized with access to another mid sized lake (perrault lake).both lakes have excellent fishing and some great crappie action as well.clarkes will even haul a couple of boats over to a trout lake within a few miles of camp if you want.they also run a outpost business a daily go.your a if your in the mood for a adventure.free minnows also for your stay.definately worth the look.
6265540,IAranger,2018-12-03 12:35:00,352,Now this place looks interesting long way to drive but doable Would like to hear more on this place and the outposts from others Thanks jeff
6265630,kona77,2018-12-03 16:36:00,236,"Our group has fished with the Clark's the last 6 years and we have fished several of their outpost lakes ( Grace, Antenna, Bertrand, Kapikik).. Will be fishing Wright Lake this coming June. Fishing has been very good on each lake and Wayne/Karla always provide great service.They are always updating their facilities and equipment and they provide other nice services (free water and minnows).. We have been going to Canada for over 25 years and have used a number of good outfitters. We would rate the Clarks as a top notch operation who work hard to provide a good fishing vacation for their clients. I have not used their drive-in services and fished Cedar lake but I know Prov-1800 can give you more details if needed."
