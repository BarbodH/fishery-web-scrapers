We mostly back troll Lindy rigs and vertical jig 18-30' deep. In speaking with Peter's friend Nick at the St. Charles All Canada show, he fishes Hornby in June and does well not far from Cabin using 1/4 oz. and plastic grub."

He asked if I wanted to join him this year but Iâ€™d rather find s new outfitter. He claims 1,400 fish per week n back trolls mainly. I went last year with Chimo n would not recommend them as the only interest they showed was go to the office n pay."
6277786,Hillbiehle,2019-01-11 09:33:00,66,I'll be going there for the 5th time (however it's been a few years since my last visit). I'm certainly looking forward to being up there again.

I have used Chimo a couple times and he was good to work with, and a guy from our group used Chimo for many years with little issues. I am/was interested in going back only if I can get the lake I want at the time I want, but if things have changed I will be happy to go elsewhere."
6278432,RichA$1970,2019-01-12 21:17:00,1159,It was just our experience and first impression with them but my friend said his trip was fine. Lake Marvin was a dud but my friend said Hornby is good.
