It seems to have taken a downturn. We fish opener or the following week consistently and I have fished it in August and late September. Planning on same week (around opener) again this year, but am wrestling with changing lakes. I know I should probably tough it out through the down times for fear of losing my week and that hope that it magically comes back to life, but...does anyone else who fishes this lake have any insight? Is it just me? My dilemma is that two of our constant crew can't make that week this year and I have two that can backfill. It is their first trip to Canada and I don't want to disappoint."
6271390,prov1800,2018-12-23 13:22:00,5010,I'd say hack it out.i get to fish there a few days per and I think fishing is very good.i have friends that live in Sioux lookout and fishing is great according to them also.its a great fishery.i fish Abram to and it also is excellent for walleye.maybe try new spots or some diff techniques although jigging seems to work just fine.
6271396,Pooch,2018-12-23 13:44:00,4618,"I have some friends that fish it every year, I think in mid June? Last year they spanked them trolling plugs. Normally they jig, but it wasn't a jig bite. I'd like to fish it sometime, but the timing of their trip doesn't fit my work schedule.Last year was a ""different"" year on every trip I made. Many others have also mentioned that they had an ""off"" year, too.Pooch"

6272412,rockape,2018-12-27 08:45:00,215,"I'll fish Minnitaki for the rest of my life. Too many great spots that produce year in and year out. Some are fantastic, and the ""bad"" years are still good. My biggest Canadian walleye and pike are from Minnitaki. And I spend a ton of time on Lac Seul every year."
6272636,prov1900,2018-12-27 23:11:00,544,"I agree. My biggest eye, pike, laker, and smallie are from there. Not sure what I was thinking when I pondered fishing elsewhere. Last year was rough because there was a pollen bloom like nothing I have seen. It really messed with our spots and it really seemed to affect the fishing overall. I am already going over my game plan for this year. May can't get here soon enough."
6276426,skap,2019-01-07 12:07:00,58,"So I have been going to Minnitaki twice a year for the last 15 years. I think what I have noticed is that the location of fish has changed over that time. We used to have spots that were consistently good every time. What I notice now is a lot of those spots are not as productive and we have had to move to new areas. Not sure if it is a food issue or what it is, but they definitely have migrated to different areas. We are now fishing different parts of the lake than where we did 5 years ago. I tend to be there more early season so that also plays a role too. Water level and temps make such a big difference with fish location early in the year. I would stick with it though as the fish are still there!Good luck in 2019!Steve"
6276910,prov1900,2019-01-08 22:48:00,544,"Thanks skap! I keep finding new spots year after year too and your post reminds me to not fish memories so much. I know that in the last few years, there has been an abundance of bait (balls), seemingly everywhere. One thing about it, the fish aren't starving to death and I can only imagine that is going to help kick out some outstanding year classes of fish, regardless of species. I will be there same time, same channel, 3.5 week of May. Good luck to you as well in 2019!"
