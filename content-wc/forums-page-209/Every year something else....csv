5212506,Pooch,2016-12-01 04:54:00,4618,"It seems that about this time of the year I start thinking back over the summers trips and lamenting the long period until we can start next years trips. Every year there are a few incidents that stand out. Here are just a couple from my boat.Some guys would disagree, but jig color can be huge. One afternoon (evening) bite slowed down so started changing jig colors and when I put on a gold jig the walleye were all over it. Change color and the bite stopped. Switch back to gold and it was game on again. Have seldom ever caught many fish on a gold jig over the years. So all you guys who never are willing to change colors? You're missing the boat or should I say ""bite"". I've had the same thing happen with other colors, too. It just happened to be gold that day.I'm a slow learner, but sooner or later the lesson becomes clear. Last falls trip and Bobo (from WC) was spanking me day after day on fish size. Smallies and walleye. He was using a far larger blade when back trolling than I very seldom ever have used and whether it was the colors (a really pretty girly pattern and color) or size. I switched to the same sized blade, but in plain copper and got closer to his action, but still came in second in a two man boat! Lesson learned... let my wife choose my blades in 2017.Every year I learn and unlearn something. The above are just two items that are stuck in a loop in my head.Pooch"

I couldn't keep the fish off the line while my buddy was striking out totally. we switched and then I was striking out. I think it's the old ""match the hatch"" adage - the fish were focused on one size minnow and forget others. a secondary factor could be the running depth - the shorter rapala ran shallower (where the minnows were?) and the longer one was just too deep for the fish to focus on. however color is a different story. some basic optics understanding is important - especially for the tannin stained water of northern Ontario - within a foot or so, red light disappears (cannot penetrate) - another few feet and oranges disappear - and another few feet and yellows disappear - by 10-12 ft essentially no red, orange or yellow light will penetrate. so, colors at this end of the spectrum shouldn't make any difference. I think action and presentation are the main factors - not color - and this has been our experience also. phish"
5213346,maddie,2016-12-01 14:32:00,42,"how about this situation, we fish the same lake in northern Quebec for the last seven years every year someone has a lure that outfishes every one else.Some years berkley flickershads other years salmo's last year it was a old bagley lure my brother dug out of the bottom of his tackle box,never has the same lure from the year before been the hot lure twice.WE do 75% trolling &25% jigging ,yes the good lures from previous years catch fish. but to stay in the game i buy new lures of different colors and sizes every year. OH buy the way i have many rapala lures and they have never been the hot lure of the week"
5214017,packpro,2016-12-01 21:27:00,695,"On a remote daily fly in lake we had three guys in the boat. Artificial bait only. We all were using Gulp black shad. At one point the guy in the middle of the boat was out fishing us 13-1-1. The only difference, he was using 3"" gulp, while we were using 5"" gulp. We started trimming ours back to 3"" .......bite on. No logic to this 90% of the fish we caught that day were over 21"". On this day big fish preferred small bait."
