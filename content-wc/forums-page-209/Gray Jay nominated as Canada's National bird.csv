5200969,MN_Moose,2016-11-20 08:41:00,964,What? the Canadian Goose isn't Canada's national bird?
5201993,Guest,2016-11-21 10:41:00,0,"You realize that this is just a magazine that decided that the Grey Jay is ""their"" idea of what our bird should be , Sort of like Time Magazine deciding who the man of the year is ............this is not a ""government official decision"""

5216090,38bill,2016-12-03 10:23:00,331,"They would get my vote. The gray jays where we fish know the sound of a cooler lid being opened. In about 5 seconds you go from no birds to a dozen or so surrounding you. Kind of like Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" movie."
5226962,Pymbet,2016-12-13 13:32:00,42,I heard Gray Jay is also referred to as the Gorby-Bird or Gorbie-Bird.I've also heard that Gorby is a slang word used by Canadians for tourist (I've visited Canada for more than 25 years and never been called one - at least to my face ). Anyone know how long that term for a tourist has been in use? Does it go back to the 1950s?
5227058,v-bay gord,2016-12-13 14:18:00,3168,"Never heard of the term before, but apparently out west in the ski areas http://onlineslangdictionary.com/mea...ition-of/gorby"
5227098,Pymbet,2016-12-13 14:35:00,42,"Thanks V-Bay. I asked about ""Gorby"" for a specific reason. I'm writing a short story set partly in Ontario about 1950 and I want a slang word for tourist that is a bit derogatory. Something an American wouldn't likely have heard or use. A slang word for a jerk (instead of tourist) would also work. Sound like Gorby may not be widely used (especially in Ontario) and it may be too modern. Any other recommendations out there."

5227770,pjshorthorn,2016-12-14 07:01:00,5654,"Here is a post from the Bow Narrows blog regarding the Canadian Bird debate. Pretty interesting. PjShorthorn Which was picked to be Canada's national bird? Evening Grosbeak, a parrot-like finch Hairy Woodpecker Black-capped Chickadee Common Loon (Photo by Bob Preuss) Goldfinch Red-breasted Nuthatch Grey Jay Blue Jay Pine Grosbeak White-throated Sparrow Canadian Geographic Magazine ran a year-long contest over which bird should be picked to represent Canada, Canada's national bird, in other words. Readers could vote for their favorite feathered icon. The overwhelming response, and I might say, the obvious choice, was the Common Loon. It is already the iconic bird on our $1 coin -- the Loonie -- and its wonderful and eerie calls are a symbol of wilderness. If Canada is anything, it is the country that identifies the most with the wild. You know you are in Canada when you see or hear a loon. The bird decision seemed like a no-brainer. Much to everybody's surprise, the magazine instead chose the Grey Jay, once called the Canada Jay, but known by everyone in the North as the Whisky Jack. The magazine perhaps anticipated there might be a backlash to its choice so it gave an explanation. The Loon migrates south in the winter (the turncoat!) and it already is a provincial bird -- Ontario's. So the magazine chose the Grey Jay which it points out is found throughout the Boreal Forest and stays year-around. It is extremely friendly and will eat right out of your hand. It also has a large brain for its body size and it caches its food. The magazine didn't tell the complete story about the Whisky Jack, however. For instance, you may never see one in an entire summer since they are quite reclusive in the warm months. You will also absolutely never see one, even in the winter, in those parts of Canada that aren't in the Boreal Forest, like Southern Ontario where about 50 per cent of the population resides. So basically we are picking as our national bird one that most people will never see in their lives. Does this make any sense? Couldn't the national bird also be Ontario's provincial bird? And should we think less of a bird because it goes south in the winter? You could hardly ask the loon to stay. It spends its entire life on the water and that gets mighty stiff each winter. So it heads to Florida where it lounges around in the Atlantic and the Gulf. In other words, it does the same thing as about one-third of human Canadians. Don't get me wrong, I admire Whisky Jacks and their friendly ways. They are regular visitors to the suet at our bird feeder here in Nolalu. I'll add a superlative about this bird that the magazine forgot. It is the slowest flier of all Canadian birds. As it glides around the understory of the bush it can just about stop mid-air without moving its wings. It seems like it is defying gravity. Chickadees are just as friendly or maybe just as fearless. They also are smart and if it matters, also cache food. So does the Blue Jay. If we're going for smarts, then we absolutely should make the raven the national bird. I'm convinced that ravens are at least as smart as people and I think a whole lot wiser. But if we really do end up with the Grey Jay, then let us go back to calling it the Canada Jay. All the photos above, with the exception of the nesting Common Loon which was taken by Bow Narrows angler Bob Preuss, came from our bird feeder this early winter in Nolalu. It has been a spectacular year for attracting birds. The White-throated Sparrow photo was taken in late-November which is remarkable because this bird normally migrates south in August.

5198570,v-bay gord,2016-11-17 16:56:00,3168,"The Gray Jay, or as it is known locally, the ""Whiskey Jack"" might be our national bird. Why? Because it's smart (raven family), is in every Province and Territory, and spends all it's time in Canada, even nesting in temperatures reaching minus 30. Seems like an appropriate choice.....and a good role model.http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/...ticle32882103/"
5198714,martinbns,2016-11-17 20:22:00,1520,I hate those things. When I used to hunt from the ground a lot I can't tell you how many chances were ruined by those horrible birds.

5198850,wallydave,2016-11-18 04:34:00,2151,"These birds are cool, when we were fishing on Miniss a year ago, every time we were on the deck, there were two pairs of birds would show up and they expected to be fed! We had lots of fun with those birds!"
5198978,pjshorthorn,2016-11-18 05:54:00,5654,Be thankful that a woodpecker wasn't being considered as the national bird. The baseball team could have ended up being renamed to something like .......the peckerheads. PjShorthorn
5199090,v-bay gord,2016-11-18 06:40:00,3168,True. They are found in the US as well...........what I meant to say is they don't migrate.
5199298,Ricky Spanish,2016-11-18 08:58:00,1298,"I can totally relate. The blue jay has to be the most annoying bird in the woods. I can't tell you how many times I've jumped out of my skin when one let out a shriek while I was in the zone in my deer stand.I am the ""parent"" of a blue and gold macaw for about the last 15yrs. I bet hunters in Central America think the same thing about them. I still think nearly all birds are fun to watch, pretty in their own way, and you are lucky if one will interact with you. My parrot hates/fears almost everyone but my wife and me."
5200441,fishron,2016-11-19 15:30:00,317,"I have fond memories of the jays on canoe trips in Algonquin Park years ago. I've never seen them on any of my many trips to eastern Ontario or Quebec since. I don't know why. I'm very observant and have a pretty good knowledge of any wildlife I've encountered. I look for them on trips and have seen stellar, pinion, Blue jays in the lower 48 along with crows, magpies and ravens. Gray jays are neat birds with personality and a good choice because they are largely Canadian. When I travel North, I know I have arrived when I hear my first Loon. I see them often when I fish the surf in New Jersey but they are silent by then. The fact that Gray stays mainly in Canada makes it a good choice in my humble opinion."
5200889,Fishoil,2016-11-20 07:58:00,1277,I enjoy the call of the loon but the one bird call that most tells me I'm in Ontario is the white throated sparrow. It's a little guy that you don't even notice but I'm sure anyone that fishes up there has heard it's call many times.
5200905,Smoke_N_Finn,2016-11-20 08:08:00,437,"Definitely don't migrate, like the giant Blue Jay's we have up here also. Grey Jay's up here are found in certain swampy like, mostly conifer forest areas. Know matter what time of year we went up to Camp, they would show up within minutes looking for snacks. We called them Lumber Jack Birds when we were kids. Sent from my XT1254 using Tapatalk"
