5196538,Guest,2016-11-15 16:22:00,0,"When I was a wee lad, pops and I would launch his 14' mirrocraft from Red's on Onalaska, go find an island somewhere on the Mississippi and live there for the week. Some of the best (and worst!) memories from my childhood through teen years. I wanted to do the same with my son. Turns out that just commandeering an island is kind of frowned upon...so I started looking into places for he and I to have that ""getaway"" experience...hopefully at the same relative budget that pops and I had. Resorts in WI were priced at a level that was hard to justify, so I decided to check out some Canadian possibilities at the boat show. Um...yeah, not meeting the budget there either. Lamenting this sad situation to a co-worker, he told me about the Canadian lodge he had been going to for 25 years. I checked out the website after a week of daily ""did you check it out?"" badgering, and had to call to confirm the price--I thought it was surely a misprint, as I could not imagine that Saturday - Saturday, all meals included, along with boat/motor/gas was going to be under $700 all-in, total, for both of us. My son was 8 that summer, and while prices have risen, we have gone every year since (7 years in a row now). If you're looking for big-screen TV's and hot tubs, this is not the place for you--but if you want to get away from everything (including cell phones!), and don't mind semi-roughing it (which was actually appealing to us), it's a perfect place. That first year was such an incredible experience--and every year since has been just as awesome. Throughout the year, we're counting down (i.e. ""only 41 weeks from this Saturday, at this exact time, we should be picking up our licenses at Four Seasons..."", etc.). All year, every year, we break into conversation about our various adventures (and misadventures, too) with very little provocation. Too many memories to list--and we're only 7 years into what (hopefully) will be a multi-decade tradition for us. -42"
5196937,Baseline,2016-11-16 05:54:00,3207,"After my college years I entered the workforce and moved away to take a job. A couple of years later I landed in northern MN where I've lived for more than 30 years. After moving to MN my dad started visiting and we began fishing together. We first went to local lakes and then to Canada. The next year we added a friend of mine and his dad and formed a group trip that lasted for 12 years before my friends dad died suddenly from a heart attack. My dad and I continued a few more years, but then my mom had serious stroke and his ability to travel became limited because he was her primary care giver. So our trips ended. He died at age 91 several years ago. He left me with a stack of photos and memories of our trips that I will carry with me forever. When my son was growing up we made many trips to Canada, Alaska, and other locations. After he hit the teen years he got involved in football and baseball and eventually landed a baseball scholarship at a SEC school. Playing baseball and his college work kept him busy year-round until he graduated. Like his dad, he entered the workforce and moved to a new city, got married, had a couple of kids, and that was that. A few years ago he took a new job and moved back to our area. I've been bugging him to resume our trips, but he is busy with his family and job. He coaches a Legion baseball team and plays in a couple softball leagues so summers are out. I finally got him to commit to making a trip north for some ice fishing in March. I'm hoping this will start a long string of these father son trips even if they are during the winter months. Over the years I've been involved with some group trip of which the membership changed year to year. As our group would lose members it became harder and harder to replace them. I finally concluded that there just aren't that many people entering the sport and even less willing to commit the time and effort to head way north. I still make 6 or 7 trips across the border each year and I have a core group of 3 other friends who have the same passion I do. We are all in our 60's and have had discussions about adding the adult kids, but like my kid, theirs are all busy with jobs, family and other interests. We will probably just keep going till we get down to one of us left. So far, so good."
5198290,Rich B,2016-11-17 10:53:00,1081,"Baseline.....thanks for sharing your life fishing history....wishing you many more years of heading north with your buddies. Hopefully your son will come to his senses (ha), and start joining you for some of those trips (and at some point have his kids join in a trip or two....and who knows, those grand kids may just develop a love for fishing up north). Faith, Family, Friends.....and fishing, Rich B"
5198306,Larbo,2016-11-17 11:25:00,231,"Family fishing trip traditions.1. Who ever caught the biggest fish does the dishes. If American plan, serves the drinks/cocktails as we got older. 2. Youngest person in the group has to wipe off the morning dew on the boat seats. 3. If you are going to drop a deuce in the bathroom a courtesy flush is mandatory. 4. If anybody in the group talk's about another person's age, weight, hair pattern/baldness or any other offense that is seconded by someone else in the group a $1 goes into the booze jar. 5. Kangaroo court goes in session on the last night and additional fines are handed out. 6. We take a group picture in front of the resort sign. 7. Since dad has passed away we hang his green rain coat up in the cabin. (I do like the picture idea)"
5198338,HeHooksHimself,2016-11-17 11:32:00,725,"Well, my bestie and BIL and I have been going to Canada for 16 straight years, along with several others that come every other or when they can. We usually have a group of 4-6. For about the last 6 years, one of my two sons (the more adventurous one) has been joining us. He has said that he knows his dad and uncle won't live forever and he craves the quality time with us. We go to the same place every spring and have built lots of memories. He can be annoying sometimes because he can't sit still and is always banging and clanging in the boat, but I would not trade one of those moments with him. We have built a special bond and he is one of the few people in my life who ""gets it"". You know what I mean ""Why do you have to go all the way to Canada? Why can't you bring home all the fish you catch? You have to use an outhouse?"" etc. etc. I have a grandson that is 14 and it is about time to get him up there, as long as he doesn't tell his grandma any ""that's what she said"" jokes and reveal how many cigars get smoked. 182 days, not that anyone is counting. Fish On! Hooks"
5227578,altemus_prime,2016-12-13 22:12:00,37,"These responses brought a lot of fond memories. We used to vacation (dad, mom, brother and i) and fish on the Ottawa river yearly when I was a youngster. Many at the camp couldn't believe a family of four would hit it as hard as we did, but we love to fish. My last trip north was when I was 15 and it was just my dad and I. We spent 5 days on the river and kept a daily log of our catch. We hammered over 200 smallmouth and numerous pike,walleye, etc those 5 days. Fish fries, telling stories and sharing hours of silence in that boat with my dad are memories I wouldn't trade for all the tea in China. Our lives were busy through high school (sports, work, etc) and after college we planned to head back north. My dad, brother and I had planned a trip for summer 2011 but unfortunately it never happened. Dad was involved in a hunting accident where my cousin accidentally shot him in the head while turkey hunting in fall 2010 and our lives have changed overwhelmingly. Although I still have dad around, he is wheelchair bound, only can use his right leg and arm, and is totally blind. I have not lost my desire to fish Canadian waters again, and this coming year plan to go with one of dad's beat friends, his sons, and some of my best friends. I sure wish I could be going with my dad. I don't post this in hopes of getting sympathy or making anyone feel bad. I simply hope to inspire anyone who is struggling to find the time to spend with those you love. I take every opportunity (at least 2-3 times per week in the warm season)to take my 4 year old son and 7 year old daughter fishing, as I want then to have the same find memories I do. Don't try to find the time to go fishing, MAKE time to share with your loved ones! Sent from my SCH-I545 using Tapatalk"
5227890,Guest,2016-12-14 09:00:00,0,"Our Dad starting taking his sons on fishing trips to Canada in the late 60's. Once we got to 7th grade, he'd take us up as a ""right of passage"". After High School there was a 4 year forced sabbatical for college. After college we were encouraged to come up as work and family allowed. Each of my 3 brothers and I enjoyed this tradition and the time we spent with our dad as something truly special. Our Dad is gone now, he passed in 1989. We spread some of his ashes at one of his favorite fishing spots. We continue with the tradition of our ""annual fishing trip"" with our sons...this year for the first time all four of us went and our sons as well. Through the years we've each included select friends as well. We now typically have a group of 12-15 guys. We honor our Dad's memory by presenting ""Dad's Trophy"" to the guy who had the best fishing trip for the trip. We also have a shot of Yukon Jack to his memory. Glad to see so many of you also have great traditions! Keep it up!"
5228434,Baseline,2016-12-14 19:29:00,3207,"I also have enjoyed reading all the stories everyone has posted to this thread. I've got one more to throw on the pile. 5 years ago my next door neighbor, who was 93, was at the end of his life. He was suffering with congestive heart failure and his feet an legs were twice the normal. He knew he was at the end. I had met him 30 years earlier when I built a house on the property next to his. He was already retired and he would walk over whenever he saw me at the construction site. We became friends and over the years we would fish locally from time to time. We would talk and visit often. He was an avid outdoorsman told me many stories of his fishing trips in the 1930's, 40's and 50's. It was a time when Minnesota lakes were much like what we find in Canada today. He also had many stories of his hunting and remote camping trips. I learned about his homemade camping equipment, old fishing rods & reels, and him making many of his own baits. I never tired of listening to his many many stories and I learned much. About 2 years before he died I sold my house and moved. About once a month I made it a point of stop by for a visit. My last visit was 5 days before he died. It was during this visit he told me something the I will never forget. He said, ""One thing you know will happen, but you never pay any attention to is that this life ends. I know you like your fishing trips and have big plans. So you get out there and do what you need to do now and don't mess around. Make those memories because that is what will sustain you when the body gives out."" He met death on his own terms. 5 days after my last visit he told his son he needed to go to the hospital. His son was going to call an ambulance, but he stopped him. He said I'm going in my own car and I want you to drive me around town so I can get one more look. When he got to the hospital they admitted him, hooked him up on oxygen, and a couple of hours later he went to sleep and passed away."
5228962,MrSimon,2016-12-15 07:52:00,922,"One tradition I have with my kids is we always stop in at a local bait shop before hitting the lake. I make a point of talking up the ""expert behind the counter"" and get stories of big fish flowing. The kids eat it up! Shops like that always seem to have endless piles of jigs sitting or hanging around - I let the kids pick a dozen or so each. They pour over the different colors and sizes like their lives depend on it. Our other tradition is to hit up a local convenient store and load up on snacks that mom wouldn't like us to have Sometimes young kids have more fun eating snacks and picking out lures than they do actually fishing. We also have a tradition of getting out of the boat and swimming - weather permitting. And hiking around exploring. Come to think of it, I'm not sure why we even take rods sometimes."
5229362,billy weaver,2016-12-15 12:59:00,470,"I have been going to Canada for many years. My son has been going with me, about 9 years ago we started taking my grandson who was six years old at the time. It is now something we look forward to and start our planning after new year. My grandson has turned into a avid fisherman. I was proud we he told me that he wanted to spend some money he had earned on a new baitcasting reel and rod. This day and age that meant alot to me. He is 15 years old and will soon be taking his grandpa instead of the other way around.(Grandson's are great)"

5199674,Xplorer,2016-11-18 13:49:00,244,"I came from a non-fishing family. How I came to enjoy doing it I really can't say, but most of my fishing as a kid and teen was done solo. I used to ask my parents to drop me off along the shores of the Mississippi, south of LaCrosse where I grew up. I would fish off the bank for a whole day, or as long as they'd let me stay (that would never happen in this day and age obviously). Never did any family fishing, but fished with friends as I got older. Anyway, when my son (who is now 14) was 7 I started making an annual trip with him up to Upper Red Lake between Xmas and New Years. We got a sleeper house and stay a couple nights. Lots of action and lots of fun. Have done at least one trip every year there. Now with him in both school and travel basketball it has gotten much harder, and this year will be a last minute trip when there is decent ice. Then 4 years ago I started doing a ""Schools Out"" trip with him up to Voyageurs National Park. He likes fishing for eyes, but he loves to cast for smallies, so this 4 day trip we camp out on the islands of either Rainy or Namakan and devote 90% of our time looking for big smallies and shallow pike. Its a great way to connect and just relax without a schedule or care in the world. Our biggest decision is what shoreline or island are we gonna fish next. I really cherish these trips and hope that we can continue them in some fashion as he grows. The first pic is from that first trip to URL, and the last on one of our trips on Rainy (yes, the date on the image is wrong, was actually mid June)"
5203217,Mike Borger,2016-11-22 09:41:00,1554,"So many genuine and heart felt responses here, thanks to all who have shared.It's obvious that a lot of members share the same sentiments. As a dad myself fishing with my boy is what inspires and motivates me more than anything. It's the primary reason I do what I do. This thread is a perfect example of what makes this board great."
5189513,jimwalleye,2016-11-07 16:49:00,30,"When I was twelve years old my Dad and two of my childhood friends headed up to Lac Des Mille Lac, ninety miles west of Thunder Bay Ontario. This was my initiation to fishing in Canada. We started fishing Lac Des Mille Lac out of Cushing Bay Resort, and it seemed like it took hours to travel from Cushing into the heart of Lac Des Mille Lac. Back then a 7.5 horse power motor and a 16 foot Lund boat served us well for many years. The year was 1962 and I remember the fishing to be fantastic, it seemed like you could cast your lure into any bay and catch 5-10 pound Northerns at will. We were one of the first guests at Pine Point Resort on Lac Des Mille Lac. Owner Al, had pushed a road into the center of Lac Des Mille Lac and this central location opened up a whole new world of fishing to us. We were proud of the fact that for more than 30 years we always brought our limit of walleyes back, most of all of them 3-4 pounds. Sadly, we didn't know better back then, but then that is another story for another time. Rarely would we ever keep a fish over the slot now because we have seen what taking out all those big fish has done to the fishery. Over the years the core group returned to fish Pine Point every Memorial Day. In 2006 my Dad took his last trip to Lac Des Mille Lac at the age of 90; Parkinson's disease had taken its toll and he lived another five years, but after a string of 44 years going north to fish Lac Des Mille Lac, and the last patriarch of our annual fishing trip gone, it became harder and harder to put together enough fishermen to fill the Cabin 14 which slept ten. For over forty years we had easily filled the cabin with prospective fishermen. After friends got older and interests and health changed we lost the rights to Cabin 14 because our group became smaller and smaller and we couldn't find enough fishermen to fill such a large cabin and no other smaller cabins were available during that busy early part of the season. Our smaller group branched out and fished other lakes like Lac Seul instead. All this leads me to my question on Walleye Central. How many other Canadian fishing trips have become a chore to try and put together as Dad's die and others became too old to tackle the north? Share a Seat is a nice feature on this website, but no doubt it does not tell the story of groups like ours that have such a long history on a lake, rich with knowledge of special fishing spots and memories. Who knows maybe we'll find some other groups out there that can join up to keep the tradition alive."
5189801,IAWally,2016-11-07 20:16:00,38,My son and I have only taken 3 trips together so far. We did not get to go this year he thought he should save his money and vacation time for his wedding and honeymoon. He is getting married 11-19-16 to a wonderful young lady who also happens to fish. Her father wants him to set up a Guys trip for the three of us. But our tradition is lunch at Buster and pick up a years supply of Blueberry BBQ sauce on our way to camp. From reading other post we will need to start a new one unless they can rebuild in a hurry.

5191746,dschiebel,2016-11-09 21:52:00,85,Lost my son to an overdose 7 years ago. He was my hunting and fishing buddy. I spread some of his ashes on a point over looking a cabin on Sessi Lake out of Northern Wilderness Outfitters. A very special place. It may sound stupid but I feel better when I post a picture of my son Chris on the wall when we are there. Life is short do what you want to do NOW.

5192242,pjshorthorn,2016-11-10 13:25:00,5654,"I would encourage you to bring even more pictures of your son on each trip you take. I am extremely fortunate to still be able to fish with my Dad and son on our trips. My Dad brings a few of his favorite pictures of his grandson fishing each year ,just to have in the cabin , even though his grandson is fishing with him. There is no better way to relive those special memories. I'll probably do the same when Dad can no longer make the trips. PjShorthorn"
5192345,Bstar,2016-11-10 15:56:00,564,What a great idea to bring a picture of someone you lost with you on a fishing trip. I lost my Dad almost 19 years ago. We went on a lot of fishing trips together whether it be to Lake Erie or northern Wisconsin or perch fishing on Lake Michigan. He only went to Canada a few times with us. Believe me when I tell you that he was NOT a great fisherman and at times it could be very frustrating to be in the boat with him. But there is not a trip that we go on where his name or an incident involving him isn't mentioned. And the memories are what it's all about! When the time comes when I will no longer be able to go fishing anymore I feel good knowing that I will have the memories to look back on. So I have 9 months to find that special picture of my Dad to take with us up to Miniss Lake and I'll put it somewhere prominent in the cabin and wish he could make just one more trip with us!
