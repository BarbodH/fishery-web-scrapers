Curious on the fishing from around the 22nd of October until and through November as the weather was so mild well into late November. Had plans to go back in early November but didn't work our so curious as to what I missed, did the big fish come in, were the late fish heavier than the thin early fish. I was there October 8th through the 20th, lots of fish, some 27 to 28+ fish however all but one were light on weight. Thanks in advance."

Hopefully she can survive Sorry off topic , But as race we sure can F things up can't we."
