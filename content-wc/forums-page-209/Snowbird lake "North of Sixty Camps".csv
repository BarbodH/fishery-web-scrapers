536448,Atlanta Dave,2004-01-10 09:46:00,323,Dave Heard years ago people got stiffed on their trips to north of sixty. I also dont know how yhou think the fishing would even compare to Lakers. Dwight and I had been all over before Lakers and none of the other camps compared . Atlanta Dave
536468,Guest,2004-01-11 06:14:00,0,"Atlanta Dave, I have considered an ""exotic"" way north trip rather than my usual drive to. When it is all said and down including airfare what is the total cost ballpark. Is it woth it ? thanks Ericp in cold Ohio"
536471,Pass the Pitons Pete,2004-01-11 10:43:00,1,"Like how's it goin', eh? I've been to Snowbird Lake. My dad and I spent 11 days there back around '95 I'm guessing. We went to that outpost camp because it was the cheapest place! They charter a jet up from St. Paul to their main lodge. The fishing was ""no H-E-double-hockey-stick"". We caught a few OK lakers, but nothing big. I've caught plenty more and bigger lakers fishing in Lake Ontario, fer cryin' out loud. I think we might have caught some pike around 10 or 12 pounds, nothing really big as I recall. And to do so, we had to travel a LONG way from the outpost camp, and camp out on our own a couple days. Not much but lakers around the outpost camp on Snowbird. I would recommend against it. The place you should try to get to, if you can, and if it's not booked, is Lakers Unlimited. My dad and I visited their Johnson Island Lodge, which opened in '95, in both '97 and '98. Arg - what a stupid board. Neither BB code nor HTML coding works. Sheesh. Here's the link:http://www.lakersunlimited.com/index.htm In '97 the two of us together caught ten lakers over 25 lbs, the biggest being 30. We caught plenty smaller ones, too. It was deep-water fishing in Lake Athabasca, ""flat line"" trolling using 6-ounce in-line sinkers with big spoons or flatfish. Jeff had told us truthfully that to that time, *every* boat he guided had caught at least one thirty-pounder. So we kept his then-perfect-record intact. I am quite certain it no longer exists as perfection, because in '98 we couldn't catch hardly ANY lakers! We were fishing during mid-August. In '97 we explored a few pike bays in the 15-mile-away-from-camp range, and caught a bunch. One day we caught over a hundred, tossing back 10 and 15 pounders! I think we caught eight pike over 20 pounds, the biggest being 25 1/2. We returned in '98 at the same time of year [the only time we could get as they were fully booked!] and had surprisingly dismal luck fishing for lakers. So we switched to pike. You could go to a bay and cast all afternoon, and catch tons of pike in the teens. One morning I was standing on the bow of the boat in a crystal-clear bay, watching the pike cruising round. I was looking for, and casting towards, the bigger pike. ""What's the matter, Pete?"" asked Jeff, our guide and co-owner. ""Bored with ten- and fifteen-pounders already?"" He was right - I was! That week my dad and I targeted big pike by trolling in open water. We didn't catch as many, but we sure caught big ones. Jeff said we were the only guests who were prepared to do this. We also made a two-day camping trip with Jeff over to Spring Bay, where my dad caught a 27-pounder that made six ripping runs on 20-pound test cranked so tight on his baitcaster that you practically cut your fingers trying to strip it off. What a fight! Jeff liked the fishing in Spring Bay so much they later set up a second outpost there! The final count for our week in '98 was 12 pike over 20 pounds. With the 27 and the 28 pounders, we had three of the top six fish caught so far that season. However my 31 pound northern still remains the Lodge Record! My perception from the website was that the fishing was slowing down a bit, because their fishing reports each year are very honest. However their 2003 fishing report makes it sound as though the fishing is as good as ever! http://www.lakersunlimited.com/2003.htm It's a great place to fish, if you can get in! Cheers, ""Pass the Pitons"" Pete Zabrok[email protected]"
536477,ggg,2004-01-11 13:44:00,115,"My son and I were there the last last week of July in 03. We were on Flett Lake. All in all I would rate the trip "" somewhat disapointing."" We were sold a story of this being a world class pike fishery. While there may be a few large pike up there, there are very few. This is primarly a lake trout fishery! On the plus side, 400 lakers in 3 days, largest 15 lbs. No monsters. Other positives, Excellect air transportation, good boats & motors, great food and the other guests in camp were of the kind that could keep you laughing all of the time. On the negative side, lodging was very spartan. Tent cabins OK but a board and 1/2"" pillow to sleep on is tough. The most disapointing fact is that they will tell you whatever it takes about the fishing just to get your money. Our camp had a man and woman caretaker who were just fantastic at what they did. We heard a lot of horror stories from other guests of other North of Sixty Camps on the flight out. Not everyone was as lucky as we were. For the money our trip was OK but don't believe everything the salesman tells you becuse he is quite the BS-er."
536490,Guest,2004-01-12 06:01:00,0,I was on Snowbird years ago with my wife. Keep in mind this was about ten years ago. What attracted us was the price of the trip. What a mistake. The motors and the boats were bad. One boat was a jet drive that would on its own go into reverse while under power. Nearly snapped the transom off of the boat and killed us. Feet were froze because of leaks. The batteries in camp went dead because off cloud cover. Solar charged at that time. We could'nt take showers. That did not go over too well with the Mrs. The propane heaters in the tents ( at that time ) leaked and we couldn't use them. Got down into the 40's at night. Couldn't dry our cloths. It was freezing. Now many of these thing may have changed. Several years ago we went to Nueltin. Windy was the name of the camp. Boy did we catch some nice Lakers between 20 and 32lbs. Also had good Northern Pike fishing. One place that we were at that stands out in my mind is a place on Savant Lake. That's north of Ignace Ontario. I think the lodges name is Wild Woods Wilderness Resort. I'not a 100% sure of the name but would find out if interested. Friends of mine have been going there for years my friends have been going for the walleyes and pike. Great Lake Trout fishing too. We went the last week of Sept and caught lots of Trout on Rattle Traps. Trolling and casting. It was a ball especially on bass rods and reels when they were up shallow. Nice cabins and I hear new boats with Hondas. This is just a recommedation to someone to avoid spending alot of money. My next Lake Trout trip would be to Plummers or Athabasca. Big bucks though. Keep in mind though. Things may have changed at N O 60. Best of luck!
536495,pike nut,2004-01-12 08:03:00,23,Run away and fast! I have not been there but I have spoken to many people who have inlcuding the all canada show in chicago this week and they were ticked off at the broken promises and BS from the sales guy. feel free to e-mail me if you wish for more info. If you want giant pike and very good lake trout and grayling fishing go to misaw lake lodge which is about 40 miles east of north of sixty. great service and the fishing is world class. If lake trout is the main target try kasba lake lodge which in the same area. Don't believe the price of N of 60. They don't inlcude gas or anything else in the package. Beware!!!!! good luck.
536508,Guest,2004-01-12 17:11:00,0,For big pike you might want to check out North American Bushman in northern Quebec. Excellent outfitter with some really great pike fishing.
536678,IAranger,2004-01-17 14:23:00,352,"I went to Snowbird in 2001 I would describe it as pretty diasppointing I went with great hopes of Giant Pike and Lake Trout. The biggest Trout was about 19# biggest pike 40"" and to get the pike we flew in to a lake called Coke I think there were lotsa decent pike but no Giant 20#+. The part I did not like was our guide drove us all over to find the fish and I think the gas was $5 gallon so our gas bill ended up being several hundred$ All in all I think I spent $2100. The flight there was good the food was good but the fishing was not what they claimed it to be. I would do it again if it was half the price Jeff"
536713,Guest,2004-01-19 06:40:00,0,"For the kind of money Arthur is expecting you would think the amenities would be a little better. As far as fishing from 10:00 to 5:00, forget it. I am there to fish and fish hard, 10:00 to 5:00 just doesn't cut it. I think you just saved me some money and disappointment. Thanks for the reply."
5213034,Guest,2016-12-01 10:26:00,0,We were at Snowbird in 2000 and were suppose to fly into Obre lake outpost camp. When we got there they said the float plane was under repairs and they would have to boat us up river to our camp. We paid extra for our float plane ride in but never got a refund. The boat ride up river was treacherous and our guide kept hitting rocks with the motor. we finally made it through the river onto Obre lake and from there was an hour ride to our cabin. The Pike fishing was awesome so that made up for the boat ride in. 20 pounders + all day long. The cabin was a shack and they first tried to put us into a framed tent which we did not pay for so we raised **** about that and from that moment on was not in good standing with the camp chef. After we got back home to the states we got a letter from the camps lawyer that we owed 1000 dollars for ruining the lower unit on our motor. we ended up in court over that deal. We never even operated our boat the whole time we were there because we had a guide every day. Needless to say I will never go back.
5213114,Mike Borger,2016-12-01 11:20:00,1554,Awesome feedback for a 12 year old thread and an outfitter that went under years ago. You couldn't go back even if you wanted to.

536525,Atlanta Dave,2004-01-13 06:38:00,323,Doc Try Kasba and spend twice as much. I rest my case. Atlanta Dave
536535,pike nut,2004-01-13 12:00:00,23,"Atlanta Dave, Maybe Doc wants what Kasba ahs to offer with amentities and such. To each his own. Lakers is a good place but it's not right for everybody. No one asked you asked you to try a case so don't rest one either. Enjoy lakers for the rest of your life. Have fun fighting 8 foot waves on athabasca."
536544,Atlanta Dave,2004-01-13 15:11:00,323,pikenut I know Doc knows what I am talking about I have been with him to lakers. Agree each to his own I do have my preference and it will remain. As for the 8 footers you must have hit a realllll bad week. Atlanta dave
536547,doc,2004-01-13 15:45:00,143,"All right guys settle down! I appreciate everyones input, thats what I love about this forum. I know what Lakers and Athabaska have to offer and it is superb fishing to be sure. It would just be nice to have a few more ameities so I was just testing the waters on other options. It doesn't sound like Snowbird is it because wherever it is the fishing will have to compare to Athabasca. In the end I will probably be back at Lakers. I just have to squeeze it in between the Elk and Caribou trip! Doc"
536553,pike nut,2004-01-13 18:42:00,23,"Atlanta Dave, I have never fished Athabaska however Jack Penny in esox angler wrote a story about Lakers and said the fishing was okay but the waves were huge!! They prevented him from fishing some good spots which is why they did not get any trophy pike for the week. The place I go to has world class trophy pike and the waves and boat rides are small but we fish 68 miles of a river system that produces some true trophies for only 16 people max per week. It to is located in Northern Sask. and goes into the NWT. Good luck this year and let us know how you do. When are going?"
536561,doc,2004-01-13 20:32:00,143,"O.K. Pike Nut, where is this spot? Mpls Dave"
536576,Atlanta Dave,2004-01-14 05:38:00,323,"Pikenut Have read much about Kasba ansd Miosaw lake have not fished them. Have fished Great Bear, Great Slave Scott Lake, monroe Lake, and the Talston river. All of these have good fishing but not both species and the consistent size that we find at Lakers. If you are fimailiar with the Penny article in Essox you also read the article from him about the 9 pike over 20lbs in one day I would guess that was at the talston river not sure but sure looked like it. I have had 8 over 20 in one day at Lakers. Each to his own and I will let you know after our June trip how we did do the same for me. Thanks. Atlanta dave"

536641,Guest,2004-01-15 19:38:00,0,Hey Atlanta Dave I read the Talston article in Esox angler and it sounds like amazing fishing. I phoned up to the N.W.T. and spoke with the guy who runs the place and I am very interested in a trip up there. Is the article accurate or maybe hyped up a little? If you could elaborate on your experience up there I'd appreciate it. Thanks in advance.
536670,Atlanta Dave,2004-01-17 08:24:00,323,cHROMER I assume yhou talked to Arthur Beck. He has the camp. There is no running water so there really is no way to take a shower also his toilet facilities aree very crude at the best. The food is marginal and he has an old native Chummy who cooks but I question how clean things are.I am not a camper type person I want a shower and inside facilities so take my post with that in mind. The quanity of the pike fishing in June was very good with a to n of teen weight fish. We were dissapointed that we only got 2 fish over 20 lbs for the 2 of us for the week and we fished hard. He has native guides and they work when they want to. You are lucky to get out fishing by 10:00 AM and they will want to be done by 5:00 with at least an hour off for lunch.Most of the time you will fish off shore or take the boat yourself which means realeasing all those Pike yourself. Most of the fishing is right by th e camp which is good because hsi boats are total crap. The other guyts who were at camp went lake trout fishing out on Great Slave and 2 of the 3 boats ran out of gas on the way in and were stranded luckily on an island for a few hours. Could still be drifting across Great Slave. All in all the fishing could be great if the if a few more 20 lb plus fish were caught but the numbers of high teen fish would be hard to match anywhere else. We burned up 2 2000 size spinning reels playing big pike on them. The camp conditions will probably never be better unless Arthur sells to someonwe who cares what he does. Feel free to ask any other questions you have.Also in the article by Eggers I think it would be impossible to catch and unhook that many fish in 24 hrs. Atlanta Dave
536519,gms,2004-01-12 19:50:00,91,"This past August we went to Kasba Lake which is just East of the North of Sixty Camps. Everyone in our group of 4 had nothing but great things to say about our 9 day trip. Besides the excellent fishing, most impressive was the hard working guides. Nothing beats a lodge where the guides are friendly, knowledgeable of the ecosystem and only take you back to the lodge when you are ready to go back (ie. Not in a rush to punch the time clock) Most days we were not back till 6:30 pm and some days later. Even if you were later they would keep your food waiting for you! As for fishing, there was not one day where we did not see 3-4 Lakers over 20lbs in the boat! My largest was 32.5 lbs. Most days we boated 20-30 lake Trout We were there August 11-19 which is considered to be ""Fall"" lake trout fishing and when they start migrating to the spawning areas of the lake. Note at this time of the year the weather up there can be quite challenging. When we had our fill of Laker fishing we headed up to the Kazan River for Trophy Grayling fishing. We could not count how many grayling we caught over 2lbs....in some ways this was icing on the cake for the trip! Food was excellent, facilities were better than average. If you wish to find out more about Kasba, I can provide you more information. See www.kasba.com for more information."
536524,Northern Manitoban,2004-01-13 00:10:00,195,I can vouch for GMS about Kasba as he sent me some pictures from his trip last year and the fish were very nice.Lakers and Grayling.My close friend guided on Snowbird back in the 80's and he had nothing good to say about the Lake trout fishing and i have seen some pictures.But he did say the camp did need some TLC.I Talked to the manager there 2 summers ago about prices there and he talked my head off and offered me a deal and even a job guiding if i wanted one.He seemed honest but i've heard so many storys about this place that it would be tough to give up your hard working dollars for a fly-in that might not work out.Kasba would be my bet.Nothing but good reviews coming from there.
