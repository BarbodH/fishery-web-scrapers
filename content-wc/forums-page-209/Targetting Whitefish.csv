5218338,fishron,2016-12-05 16:24:00,317,"After reviewing a couple of ""how to clean a whitefish"" sites and hearing of their eating qualities I'm going to keep the next one I catch. That being said, I probably will never catch another one."
5218490,BornToFish,2016-12-05 19:11:00,1224,"Greetings,I've learned a few things about cleaning whitefish. I tend to leave the skin on the fillets to help hold the meet together. Given this, our favorite way of eating whitefish is when they are prepared on the grill. Smaller whitefish are great when fried. I remove the skin when making a chowder or something like that. Whitefish is simply delightful at the table.Other than that, I clean them the same way that I would clean a northern pike. The ""Y"" bones of whitefish are slightly angled towards the back of the fish, and not straight up/down as in a walleye.Enjoy!"
5221922,Bakefish,2016-12-08 13:54:00,1077,"I do not enjoy smoked fish, however....smoked whitefish is absolutely incredible."
5222130,phishfearme,2016-12-08 16:43:00,1242,maybe you've been smoking whitefish??
5222666,Bakefish,2016-12-09 07:11:00,1077,"Nope, makes the papers all soggy and hard to light."
5212738,JohnWF,2016-12-01 07:22:00,129,I think some of the local folks around Sioux Narrows use nets.
5212778,BornToFish,2016-12-01 07:49:00,1224,"Greetings,I find whitefish to be a fascinating fish to catch. They are spirited fighters and wonderful on the table, especially when prepared when they are fresh. I find that the oils in whitefish can turn ""rancid"" when kept in the freezer too long.The lake that I fish in NW Ontario has a good population of whitefish. Most of my catches of whitefish happen in the very early season or well into autumn. The whitefish seem to hang out in the vicinity of river mouths for the first few days of the season, and then move to deeper and colder water when they think the water is going to warm up. Conversely, the whitefish typically move into their traditional spawning areas in late September, in anticipation of their spawn. I catch a fair number of whitefish during these timeframes, without ever targeting them. I catch a few whitefish during the remainder of the open water season. They spend a lot of their time suspended over the deepest water in the main lake basin. They sometimes wander into a piece of structure that I am fishing for walleyes. I'm sure these catches are more accidental than anything.I am fortunate to have access to a great whitefish fishery near my home. We target them through the ice. I've learned a few things along the way. The disposition of whitefish lends itself to finesse fishing. Whitefish are on the other end of the spectrum from northern pike. However, they will take larger baits and are fierce fighters when on the line.Another aspect of whitefish that can be leveraged by the angler is that their curiosity can get the best of them. I think they are something like kittens. I often find that I can tease them into biting. Their presence will often be indicated on my Vexilar for several minutes before they bite.Most of the time, I detect the absence of a bite when catching whitefish. Their mouths are pointed somewhat downwards. They suck the bait upwards into their mouths. I set the hook when my line becomes somewhat lighter.Whitefish are a fish that are often overlooked. They are spirited fighters and simply awesome when served at the dinner table.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5212818,Travis Schallock,2016-12-01 08:26:00,37,"I have caught them mid summer and found them fairly easy to catch. I got into them by accident pre-fishing for a smallmouth tournament in 30-40 FOW, and found it to be a reliable pattern since then. These were those fish everyone marks just off bottom in deeper water that don't seem to be interested in anything. We were rip jigging blade baits, making long casts and letting in sink to bottom, then rip it up and letting it sink back to bottom all the way back to the boat, and they will hammer it. I'm still surprised by how hard they will hit the blade baits, but if you try a more subtle approach they have such a soft bite. You just have to be careful fighting them as it is easy to tear the hooks out of there mouths, but they sure fight good. Its worked for me most times I've tried it since then. Funny how easy it can be once you stumble on to it."
5216018,Bill Krejca,2016-12-03 09:46:00,6107,"It sort of sounds like a variety of lures will work. Sometimes. The key seems to be some type of bait that will get down to the level the fish are at, and has the amount of weight/resistance to usually assure ability to feel the take. Maybe not that different from fishing for other species. I still wonder why we don't catch more. Also, I am aware of netting which takes place for them, particularly in the fall when they spawn. Thanks for all the ideas, if I get serious with targeting, I'll share what happened. Next year. Any other ideas? Bill"
5216066,38bill,2016-12-03 10:07:00,331,"Whitefish need cool, oxygen rich water so they typically stay deep during the summer. They are excellent eating when fresh but they just don't keep very well. Other ""soft"" fish like trout and grayling are similar."
5217337,yoopertrout,2016-12-04 16:32:00,1172,"I've targeted them through the ice and had luck with a 3"" long hammered silver swedish pimple, jigged very aggressively. I've also caught them by accident on spoons in the summer. I'd love to be at the right place and time to get them on a fly rod. I've also caught large cisco through the ice, while jigging for salmon. We were getting the salmon on Jig-a-whoppers, and we could see schools of cisco coming through and hitting on our gold swivels. That was years ago, and I haven't been back to the spot, but if I were to go, I think I'd tie a gold ribbed hairs ear fly to the swivel. I've also seem people catch them in the summer, bottom fishing with salmon eggs."
5217402,Moosebunk,2016-12-04 17:54:00,211,"First whiteys came on a foam post dry fly size 10-12 Klinkenhammer on the Moose River in Ontario. Since then they've been caught on soooo many freaking different things but, two standards are Meegs-like jigs dressed with crappie-sized tubes and the Williams jigging spoon. Genz diamond head jigs with Ratsotails or the like work great too. Those have been good for icing whiteys, which can somedays be in 6fow and others in 60fow. Summer whiteys have been best on 1/4 oz bucktail jigs tipped with worms. Find them feeding, cast that in there."
5217410,adempsey2.0,2016-12-04 18:05:00,612,"My catches are 90%+ in the winter. The times I've caught them in the summer were during a mayfly hatch using a slip bobber and worm. Also, caught one in the Ogoki river jigging for walleye.In the spring I fished for them in Lake Simcoe. We had to use two anchors to keep the boat still so we could vertically jig for them on 60+ FOW. Worked great though.Probably one of the nicest tasting fishes as well. I'd target them in the summer, but you need a real calm day [or wake up at 5:00AM maybe? lol, I wouldn't know] and bringing in an anchor with chain and 200 feet of rope on a fly-in is no fun."
5217426,BornToFish,2016-12-04 18:29:00,1224,"Greetings,I frequently jig for whitefish through the ice. A very common setup is to put the main monofilament line through the eye of a #10 treble hook, then through a small, colorful plastic bead, and then tie to a small swivel. We then run a dropper (about 10-15 inches or so) from the swivel to the lure of choice (e.g. a Rapala jigging Rap, small spoon, jig, etc.). I've noticed that the active whitefish normally go after the lure of choice. The active fish come in and clobber the main lure. On the other hand, the inactive whitefish often go after the treble hook when it's tipped with two waxworms or other grubs. It's as if the fish are curious about the plastic bead, and then get tempted by the waxworms.I use a Vexilar flasher when fishing for whitefish. I can watch the whitefish go back and forth between the two baits.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5217546,Darrenf442,2016-12-04 21:45:00,1369,Ive caught the big lake whitefish on a black grub jig during the winter and ive been to another lake durning the summer and we caught the smaller silver white fish trolling small spinners. Both really by accident. They are excellent to eat and are just as good if not better then walleye if cleaned right.
5211722,Bill Krejca,2016-11-30 12:17:00,6107,"To make another attempt to initiate a little more traffic, I'll throw out the following query: Had anyone ever intentionally targeted whitefish? I have occasionally caught a white fish or two while targeting walleyes, but have never ""gone after them"", mainly because I'm not sure how. This fall, I found a school of something in 60 feet of water, suspended about 40 feet down. I suspect they were whitefish, but could have been something else, probably not trout on this lake. I did not stop and fish for them, but just thought about doing it next time out in the area. From what I have been able to research, the fish prefer small baits, as their mouths are small. Also, their flesh is soft, so care must be taken on the retrieve. I do remember my late father saying ol' timers used to use hand-lines and small hooks due to use of a rod being more likely to tear the hook out. Has anyone experienced any willing-to-share techniques? Thanks, Bill"
5211754,v-bay gord,2016-11-30 12:30:00,3168,"I believe it may vary from lake to lake, and on what the whitefish are feeding on. I've ice fished for them on Shoal Lake and they absolutely hammered a 3 inch long Williams spoon (not sure the exact model, but these had hooks on the sides as well as the bottom treble). Apparently the forage was some type of introduced smelt. On a nearby portage lake we can catch trout and whitefish in September jigging 3/5 oz Little Cleo's or similar type jigging spoons. Sometimes tying a feathered floating jig head on the same line (up 4 feet from your spoon) will work well too. When jigging for whitefish they will often bump and miss your bait, or hit it on the drop......so you need to pay attention. While they may have a small mouth I'm often amazed at how they can get the whole treble in their mouths."
5211954,Pooch,2016-11-30 15:21:00,4618,"Bill,We've also caught them accidentally. They put up a great fight, but seem to be very fragile and bleed easily. Have not caught one in years, but also suspect those ""uncatchable's"" we mark fairly often are probably whitefish. Many times they are fairly deep and could be lakers, but we can never catch whatever they are. Regardless of what we try. Many times we mark ""something"" deep in a hole between islands. Whitefish?Pooch"
5212050,Fisherman Ted,2016-11-30 16:13:00,461,We catch them here and there. With live bait (crawlers) for sure when drifting. Also on a fly-rod during a mayfly hatch. With their mouths on the underside of their snout they will come up and bat the fly under the water and then hoover them up. -FT
5212074,fishron,2016-11-30 16:35:00,317,"I have to admit, I'm confused by this species. I've caught them shallow. Usually when jigging for walleye. They fight well and always seem to be about 20 inches long. No foot longers or anything outside the norm. They are slimely buggers that die quickly if not released promptly. I've been told they are good table fair in the cooler months. These shallow water whitefish that I'm describing have been encountered in the mid-northern portion of Ontario. In the southern portion of Ontario where I have fished a lot, I have never encountered a shallow water whitefish. The lake I'm most familiar has them in deep water and I have seen them dead on the surface after a strong barometric pressure change or perhaps a lightening strike. They appear similar in appearance. I'm very good at fish identification and I'm not incorrectly identifying chubs, fallfish or ciscos. So that's been my experience with whitefish. I've read that they can be caught on small lures during a hatch, but I've never targeted them."
5212082,1K1MOA,2016-11-30 17:00:00,90,"I have targeted them for years now and they actually are pretty easy to catch, if you can control your drift to be slow. We enjoy catching a few, keeping them alive on a stringer, and then having fresh Whitefish as a shore lunch. I personally think they taste better than Walleye when taken care of. Ironically, I just finished eating my last Whitefish tonight that I caught in June. So to catch them is pretty easy. the shallowest I have caught them is 35' and normally do the best between 40 and 60' and where they are suspending a bit off the bottom, say 5 - 10 feet. Yes, they have small mouths, but they will take a normal walleye jig and minnow if you suspend it. They typically don't hit when jigging alot, they like it slow and suck it in. My favorite way to catch them is with a small Willow spoon with single hook, which by the way is a nice Walleye bait too, with a small minnow on it. It just flutters down really slow and I have out fished my buddy 4:1 when I use that vs. him using jig and minnow for Whitefish. I strip the line by hand to know how deep I am, and then just twitch it to get the hit. They normally are lip hooked and if you handle them carefully you can put them on a stringer and keep them alive until ready to clean them. We have done that numerous times and have kept them alive for hours, they are not as wimpy a fish and some make them out to be. Where I fish in Ontario, you can keep 25 with a regular license if you want to bring some back."
5212122,v-bay gord,2016-11-30 17:34:00,3168,"I agree with this post in that a slow approach is often key. They can be aggressive but often a subtle approach is the only thing that works. If you aren't paying attention on those days you will often miss the bite, or strike."
5212282,phishfearme,2016-11-30 19:52:00,1242,"there is a significant potential for species confusion here. on our trip to lac evans in northern Quebec, we went into a bay, threw some spoons and started catching what we thought were whitefish. many of them and they were almost all 18 to 19 inches. our outfitter or the camp manager were no help in identifying them but I'm convinced they were either mooneyes or gold eyes - very similar in appearance to whitefish except for the mouth - and the fact that they were clearly a fish eating species - something I do not think lake whitefish are (in general). we've never encountered these in Ontario - but I'm sure they are around the north country. around Erie, PA, smoked whitefish is a wonderful delicacy - but people catch them in nets and I think would laugh at someone trying to use bait as they just don't seem to co-operate (in general). phish"
5212522,Mike Borger,2016-12-01 05:08:00,1554,"Having just fished Evans this August, I can say with certainty those were goldeyes. Evans is LOADED with them. One of the reasons why there's so many big pike probably. Also, for whatever reason, it seems to be a NE Quebec phenomena, because I've found them in many lakes in that region and nowhere else."
5212554,Mike Borger,2016-12-01 05:37:00,1554,"Regarding the whitefish, it's weird. I seem to have no problems catching them through the ice, but targeting them in the summer has always been frustrating!The only time I ever had success catching them was in June at my camp in QC when the mayflies were hatching. Every evening hordes of them were rising all over the lake in front of my cabin picking flies off the surface.I had brought my flyrod along just for this purpose along with a box of high floating mayfly patterns. At first it was incredibly frustrating, I'd get this crazy hit, and pull back to nothing. Then I watched closer and saw what was happening. A mayfly was floating on the surface right next to the boat. As I watched it, a whitefish came up and swatted at it with its tail submerging it, then sucked the fly in at its leisure once it was underwater. Not too surprising since they have under slung mouths.After that I forced myself to count to three after the hit then slowly lift my rod - very hard to do trust me. Almost every time I would connect and had an amazing time for the next three nights in a row catching them on dries until the hatch petered out.This past September at Echoing Lake, one bright sunny day the whitefish went nuts and began to hammer our oversized spoons meant for pike and lakers. When they're so inclined they can be amazingly aggressive!"
