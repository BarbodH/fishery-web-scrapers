It's like a superhighway compared to the road into Oba.I was told by the owner of the camp that you can't drive in with a car. Bare minimum you need a pick up truck with higher clearance or some kind of 4WD vehicle.Sure hope this doesn't change your plans. This place is another one of those hidden gems, you'd love it!"
5224802,123chadder,2016-12-11 14:37:00,429,we have already put our deposits in so no changing plans now
5224850,Rich B,2016-12-11 15:50:00,1081,"123, Be sure to post a report when you get back after your trip to this camp....hope you have a great time....sounds like the fishing is excellent.... Rich B"
5204489,ziggyzag,2016-11-23 12:45:00,125,"Looking for a place near Wawa Area to drive to next spring, looking to take the family and do some fishing and riding atv's we will need a house keeping cabin outfitter supplied boat and motor. Any and all suggestions very welcome. Good Walleye and Pike fishing would be nice."
5204585,Mike Borger,2016-11-23 14:22:00,1554,"I visited the former Totomenai Lodge near Hawk Junction with my son last May and had a great time. Fished nearby back lakes for brook trout and splake and did well. Caught some nice lakers and walleye fishing Whitefish and Manitowik lakes which the lodge is situated on.I'll admit I'm biased because the hosts Martin and Jenn Wearn are friends, but they're really awesome people.My story on the trip:http://www.canadafishingguide.net/a-...ir-dale-lodge/Their website:http://outpostcamps.com/"
5204921,Shellback,2016-11-23 18:16:00,8083,I've heard good reports on this lodge as a family destination. Probably less than a hour east of Wawa.http://www.paquettescamp.com/index.htm
5204993,adempsey2.0,2016-11-23 19:06:00,612,"Happy Day Lodge is another option. Price is great, fishing is fairly decent but it books up fast. If you go this route, try to get a boat with the largest motor they rent - and they do rent some nice boats. It's a big lake and the lodge is at the far east end."
5215706,Bobby Winds,2016-12-03 06:03:00,10817,"http://www.airivanhoe.com/ They have it all, fly-in, boat in and drive in accommodations. The drive in are excellent. Bob"
5216322,123chadder,2016-12-03 16:45:00,429,"http://www.ontarionorthfishing.com/index.htm im going here in late june,it was recommended by mike borger...."
5216490,Mike Borger,2016-12-03 19:30:00,1554,"Awesome place, fly in quality fishing for sure, but it's nowhere near Wawa. There's no more passenger train service, so if you're driving there it's a long gravel road south of hwy 11."
5217066,123chadder,2016-12-04 11:22:00,429,isnt hawk junction near oba?
5217082,Mike Borger,2016-12-04 11:29:00,1554,Sort of. But you can't get to the camp from Hawk Junction. Like I said it's a very long gravel road to camp that leads south off hwy. 11.
5218330,123chadder,2016-12-05 16:18:00,429,is it as bad as sultan rd?
