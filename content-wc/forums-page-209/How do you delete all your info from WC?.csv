5205889,Baseline,2016-11-25 05:34:00,3207,"""The owners of Walleye Message Central reserve the right to remove, edit, move or close any thread for any reason.""This is a line from the ""Terms of Service Agreement"" everyone agrees to when register for WC. All you need to do a search of every thread you ever started or commented on and add derogatory comments to each thread. You only have 2300 threads and comments to find so you should be completely deleted from WC in 5 to 10 years. Of course there are all those forwarded shares of WC posts to the rest of the internet so finding them would take some additional time."
5206417,Obabikon,2016-11-25 13:23:00,2370,"Leave it to Gord the ATTENTION SEEKER to stir the pot so early in the offseason. hahahaha... guys, we run out of things to talk about. Relax, its simply a conversation, and no negativity needs to be tossed around. Anyhow, this thread got me thinking about Rose. She and John purchased Cliff Lake about the same time that I got in the business (going on 11 years now). I looked up her info, and all threads and topics were still there. She posted 3-4 times in 2012... but hasn't really posted here since 2008. Crazy how time flies. Time flies but walleye central topics are forever!"

5202361,Guest,2016-11-21 16:26:00,0,Just stop jabbering and you'll soon be forgotten like so many others.. It's not like you're a disciple.
5202417,v-bay gord,2016-11-21 17:04:00,3168,"True, but I couldn't sleep at night knowing WC didn't have some ""Canadian perspective"" whether you want it or not. It's like getting your teeth cleaned......you hate it but you know it's good for you. Besides, Draco1206 once referred to me as ""Lord Gord"" and that comes with some responsibility..........."
5202553,pjshorthorn,2016-11-21 18:32:00,5654,"Actually, I think you were first called a preacher first and then Lord Gord. Attached is a gentle reminder of your true place in WC land. PjShorthorn."

5201457,That Minnesota guy,2016-11-20 19:50:00,8293,Its the internet......you are there forever.
5201505,martinbns,2016-11-20 21:18:00,1520,"Why do you want to delete yourself? On other sites I am around, if something bad is happening to them ie harrassment etc, sometimes the owner/moderator will delete your profile for you. It would be tough for you to delete over 2,000 posts though."

5201753,v-bay gord,2016-11-21 07:32:00,3168,That's what I thought......we are all stuck in purgatory together! As a rhetorical question it is interesting that you can join but you can never leave. Perhaps that is REW's secret to longevity..
5201769,That Minnesota guy,2016-11-21 07:54:00,8293,"This site and others are what we make of them I guess. They can provide entertainment, information, anger and rage amoung some. There are some people who their joy comes from trying to antagonize as many people a day as they can. I've learned to really try and ignore those as they have no interest in contributing anything to the site or it's members. Others are amazing at the info they provide fixing and repairing things. Finding schematics, diagrams ect. Then my favorites are those who only think the world revolves the way they think. Of course what would any site be witout the guys who post jokes and fun stories. So yes we can stay or go away from being active or we can select what interests us and ignore the rest."
5201777,doubleheader,2016-11-21 07:56:00,2652,"Well said. Personally, I do my best to ignore the negative attacks and try as best as I can not to respond to them when they are directed towards me. Not saying I'm perfect, but I do try to keep to the high road."
5201833,Lovetofish,2016-11-21 08:36:00,458,"Just like the great song say's Gord, ""you can check out anytime you want, but you can NEVER leave"". LOL"
5202169,Bobby Winds,2016-11-21 14:06:00,10817,Just like Ann Lander's........REW is on it's third person posting.........LOL
5202233,Oldschool,2016-11-21 15:09:00,163,"I hope that you are here for at least one day after I am gone, Gord. I get a lot from your posts, whether it be simple fishing information, stuff from around the Vermilion area, or just good humor. For what it's worth."
