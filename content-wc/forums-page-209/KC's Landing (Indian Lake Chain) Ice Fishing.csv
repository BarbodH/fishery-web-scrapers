5208770,Guest,2016-11-28 09:44:00,0,So I have a deposit sitting up at Clarks on the Indian Lake chain that I was unable to use this summer. They graciously offered to let me use it Ice Fishing. Right now it is looking like Early MArch will fist the schedule best. Anybody ever tried it up there around that time?

The weather is milder then, minus 20's F is still possible, but over 0 F during the day is more likely. There is usually plenty of snow on the trails, although the temps will dictate that. It seems like walleye fishing always gets better toward the end of the season and there are plenty of good trout lakes in that area to fish if the walleye are slow. I enjoy ice fishing here all winter long, but if I could only ice fish one week out of the year, I would take my chances on the first week or two of March. You never know about slush at any time of the season...Enjoy your trip."
5221562,revitup,2016-12-08 09:55:00,140,Any reports on ice conditions at this time at KC's? Is there fishable ice yet? Enough for shanty's to be on the ice? Enough to drive on?
