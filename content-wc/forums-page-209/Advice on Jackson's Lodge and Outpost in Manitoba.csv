5209818,dmairs,2016-11-29 08:31:00,5,Looking for a new experience this year and have come across the Jackson's Lodge and outposts website. This fly in trip sounds like what our group is looking for. Has anyone out there has much experience with them? What lakes do you recommend? How is their equipment?
5210098,KSjim,2016-11-29 11:14:00,88,"Our group of 4 had a very good trip to Black Currant in June of 2014. As a group we caught 34 walleye 23"" to 27"". Not many Northern's, largest 36"" but we don't spend much time fishing for them.Camp and boats were fine. Hot water heater went out middle of the week. They brought a new one in the next day. Good outfitter would definitely use again."

5212354,zeebee,2016-11-30 20:34:00,1144,"My son and I fished Bradburn with Jackson Air some 15 years ago. One of the best trips for both size and numbers. Can be fished in any weather and accomodations/service 1st class.At various times it was a full time job just netting and rebaiting my sons jig. Largest came trolling shad type raps in silver/chrome finishes...wouldnt hit chartreuse.As I recall, my son took his 2nd largest soft water 'eye on that trip...31"" on a silver Risto Rap. I also recall the fish were all fat and healthy..in fact more so than on any other body of waterIve fished.As a side, I remember waiting in the cabin for our flight out after our week. Way down the river we spotted two canoes paddling in the light mist. As they got closer, we could make out the figures of some pretty bigdudes looking about as rough as any of our bush dwelling natives can get. They paddled up to the dock, got out of their canoes and lumbered up to the cabin where they entered without so much as a knock or hello.The lead fellow who must of been 6'4"" walks right up and in a soft voice asked if we had any lard. At that moment I would have paid $100 for a brick or two but I said we had none. He turned around, began to walk out and says....""Ifyou aint got lard, how the *&%#$&*()* do you cook your fish. Back in the canoes they went and I suppose, onward on their quest for the lacking lard."

Good thing because Jackson has great reputation and previous camp manager knew he was going out and could care less about our connections etc. - and I fished Little Sass with Jacksons and they were much better organized. Fished Red Willow too before they took it over. We had lousy weather at Harrop but still caught Walleye easily enough and a few big pike. If it weren't for weather I am sure we would have done even better. Love to go back some time - had a big group and we took over the whole place. Little Sass we caught walleye in the 16-18 inch range all day, plenty of action, pike too, but nothing of size. It was a fun trip. Red Willow had two cabins, one was one of the nicest ever fished from other not as nice but still ok ( showers and toilets). Plenty of fish but no trophies. All these trips were great for fun and memories."
5221122,Mike Borger,2016-12-08 04:48:00,1554,"Thanks! It's great hearing feedback about places other than NW Ontario.Just curious, but did you guys drive all the way from Buffalo or fly to Winnipeg? I live super close to you and wouldn't dream of driving LOL!"
5221426,spoonchucker,2016-12-08 08:39:00,82,"Mike- we flew from Toronto- but this year we got an incredible price on a group flight from Buffalo to Winnipeg from United- 375 round trip ( without needing the transport to and back from Toronto it is cheaper than air canada even with the exchange and more convenient) as we are going back to Edmund- I think we leave Edmund when you come in. Funny but we were considering Misekumaw and would have flown out right when you were coming in. Still intrigued by Misekumaw but for several reasons we passed on it- will wait for your report. Frankly we wanted what we know for this year, Edmund, rather than risk a possible bad weather trip in June. Last year the early June weather made our trip to Northern Ontario poorest fishing condition we have had in years. No trip has ever yet been as good as Edmund for us."
5221442,Mike Borger,2016-12-08 09:00:00,1554,"Sounds like a great deal, especially direct out of Buffalo! FWIW Air Canada has never been my favorite choice. More expensive and I always get stung with huge charges for overweight or extra baggage. Westjet is by far my favorite airline within Canada.Sounds as though we're on the same page with trips!! If you really are flying out of Edmund on the 15th I would assume we'll cross paths? That would be great. It would be cool to get some first hand intel from an angler who knows what he's doing! I have real high hopes for Misekumaw in late June, I can't believe it won't be incredible, but time will tell. In general early June is prime time for large numbers of big pike. My trip with Gangler's this year was incredible even though we did face some tough weather.Different pattern in August, but in some ways better. How can you not enjoy casting for pike when they're hyper aggressive and much heavier than they are in the spring?"
5229042,spoonchucker,2016-12-15 08:34:00,82,"Mike- I just checked our dates and yes we fly out of Edmund on the 15th so I suspect we will cross. It is a bit strange fishing up there and seeing the cabins all boarded up that were once an owner's dream of a fishing lodge. As to Misekumaw, We may well do 2018, but our concerns were that they we had 11 as they said they could accomadate but then we were told that that meant 3 boats, three men each with 15 hp and one boat 2 men with 10 hp. Looking at the size of the lake we really wanted assurance of 2 men each in 15 hp and bite the bullet on one 3 man baot. There were also other concerns ( I have flown out of that area beforre and I know JUne can mean one or even two days stuck at base and on a four day trip it is too risky, so we wanted July but no one has ever fished it then ( could be good or bad) and so we played it safe with Edmund where we know the fishing is great."
5229482,Mike Borger,2016-12-15 14:59:00,1554,"11?? Wow, can totally understand why you didn't choose Misekumaw! That's a crazy sized group, now I'm worried you guys are going to sting every good fish before I get there LOL!"
