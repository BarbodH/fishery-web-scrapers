5235026,SterlingArcher,2016-12-21 10:45:00,92,Is there a time limit on filling out the form? Every year I forget to do it after my trip!
5235114,skindzier,2016-12-21 11:31:00,137,"Couple things - #1 Gord didn't mention it, probably for fear of being accused of advertising, however, he actually fills the thing out for you - how cool is that? #2 The check comes in Canadian funds (makes sense, right?), so your bank may charge you a fee to cash it..."
5235130,Pooch,2016-12-21 11:54:00,4618,One bank I deal with will take the check and send it off then deposit the converted amount into my account. There is a small charge. Not all banks are interested and prove it by the amount they charge for handing the transaction. Usually takes a week or so.I've also taken last years check with me back to Canada and cashed it up there at one of their banks. Kind of a hassle to find an open bank when traveling so easier for me to do it at home.Pooch
5235218,v-bay gord,2016-12-21 12:54:00,3168,The back of the form says you have one year to submit for a rebate.
5235226,v-bay gord,2016-12-21 12:58:00,3168,...I will also mail it in for you. I can also accept your rebate check (no fees) as part of your deposit. That's how cool I am!
5235490,pjshorthorn,2016-12-21 17:29:00,5654,"Yup. We meet Saturday morning in the lodge at the end of a trip to settle up, and Gord apologizes for having to take our money .....very Canadian like. Included in the paperwork is the HST rebate form ready to be signed. The form magically gets to the Canadian govt. and I receive a check in about 4-6 weeks. I mailed my rebate check and deposit to Gord this week for our 2017 trip using a very presidential Canadian stamp. All the funds are applied to our upcoming trip. No filling out forms, no mailing forms, no fees for cashing a rebate check at a personal bank in the US and no worries about finding a bank in Canada on the way to the lodge to cash the check. It doesn't get any easier than this. Gord has actually gotten used to me bringing my adding machine to our check out meetings to verify everything ,so.......that is how cool he is PjShorthorn"
