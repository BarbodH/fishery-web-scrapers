5227146,fishron,2016-12-13 14:51:00,317,What's a good time of the year for walleye and pike on Gull.
5227610,Bobby Winds,2016-12-14 03:10:00,10817,I only fished it the last Saturday of June for a week.
5227802,north560,2016-12-14 07:35:00,53,"Check out Gowbushkon Lodge in Northeastern Ontario. Great fishing, walleye,pike small mouth trout. No outposts but lots of lakes, in the area to drive to or 4X4 to. Reasonable rates."
5228450,Baseline,2016-12-14 19:35:00,3207,"I've got two suggestions for you. Check their websites for details. Both meet your requirements. Separation Lake Camps on the English, River. Located just north of Kenora. Good gravel road to landing. Boat in. Stay at the main camp or their outpost. Cobblestone Resort, Ingace Ont. They have an outpost camp on Godden Lake & Kukukis Lakes. Boat In using their boat or use your own to get to camp. Boats and motors cached on Kukukis which is the preferred lake to fish. Very nice outpost.Both of these resorts have excellent walleye, smallmouth and pike fishing."
5222602,MrSimon,2016-12-09 06:29:00,922,"Hello Canadian trip gurus .... I'd love some ideas for a trip with the following criteria:Outpost, or at least outpost experience - no neighbors, no generators, no boat traffic etcNo planes - must be either a drive-to or boat-to location. A main lodge with outposts spread out on bush lakes would be fine. We'll have a pretty tough 4x4.PIKE!!!!! We want lots and lots of pike in the medium range with a solid shot a 40.Small to medium sized lake - we don't want to be on some gargantuan body of water, but we also have to fish it for a week, so no ponds.Within 8 hours of the soo, or 12 hours of the Thousand Island Bridge.Access to multiple lakes via portage or 4x4 trail would be awesome too - we can bring smaller boats, canoes, motors if neededThere will be between 4 and 6 guys who are all seasoned fishermen .... we just want to relax in a secluded and beautiful location and catch boat loads of toothy critters! We aren't picky about accommodations ... as long as there is a fridge, roof, and beds we are fine.Weedy bays make us really, really happy!!!"
5223409,adempsey2.0,2016-12-09 20:19:00,612,You might be better off figuring out a good camp site. I've seen some reports on here that do that annually and their camp looks better than half the outposts.
5224866,Rich B,2016-12-11 15:59:00,1081,"You might look into Happy Day Lodge (about 4 hours from the Soo) as they have one outpost at the other end of their lake, and very few cabins on the lake system (and no other camps). I've fished by their outpost (to check it out), and it is a fair distance from the main camp, so you wouldn't see many if any other boats. Can't say much about pike action as we only fished for walleyes and SM Bass, so you would need to talk with either Bob or Sonya, though their lake system holds larger pike. Well run camp (family) and beautiful lake system with good fishing. I know this outpost cabin books up quickly (is a nice clean cabin), so if interested I'd check it out now to see what open dates are still available. Have a great trip wherever you end up....and yes, I've been to their main camp a number of times with my buddies and once with my family....though it's been a few years since our last trip up. Rich B"
5225042,Guest,2016-12-11 19:36:00,0,"Well Rich. I bet you didn't catch too many ""toothy"" Pike at HDL."
5225362,Shellback,2016-12-12 06:12:00,8083,"I know the OP has been to Happy Day, in fact we spent an hour or so together previous to my trip there. He shared some great info. The wife and I got some quality fish, both walleye and pike. Love to go back, but it was a 22 hour drive. Too much driving for 2 days, and tough to warrant 6 days on the road for 6 days fishing."
5225378,MrSimon,2016-12-12 06:43:00,922,"Yup, I've been to HDL twice. It's a nice place with unlimited amounts of medium sized walleye and big smallies, but it's a huge, deep, structur filled lake and the pike spread out all over the lake and relate to deeper structure. For this trip, we are more interested in shallower, weedy lakes where you can cruise endless cabbage and reed beds casting for pike. Our goal is to be catching 26-32"" pike regularly with a handful of 38-42s thrown in. I've done hours and hours of research and contacted some very knowledgeable folks .... and it's becoming obvious that the type of outpost pike fishing we are looking for is found one of two ways .... either drive REALLY far up into some remote camps in NW Ontario, or do a fly-in. We've got some deciding to do!"

5226706,MrSimon,2016-12-13 10:30:00,922,"Looks like a very nice lodge, and is a nice short drive. It's not quite what we're looking for for this particular trip, but I certainly might go there with the family. How is the pike fishing?"
