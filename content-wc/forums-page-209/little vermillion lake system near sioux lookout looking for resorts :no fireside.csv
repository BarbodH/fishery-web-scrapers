5227794,Pooch,2016-12-14 07:31:00,4618,"I think Fireside is the only camp on Little V. We occasionally fish Little V on our way to Lac Seul. There are no walleye in Little V or Big V. Little V is Northern, Musky and Small Mouth. Big V also adds Lake Trout. We have never kept any fish out of either lake. Seems I remember them being or at least Big V C&R. There are maybe one or two camps on Big V near Hudson. I'll contact some of my friends that might have stayed there. You would have to trailer you're boat if you wanted to fish both lakes. Fair amount of driving between the two lakes access.There is public access to both lakes. Access to Little V public ramp is through the Ojibway Park.There are guys on this board who are familiar with both and guide on a lot of lakes in the area.Pooch"

It's a boat in camp on a good sized lake that seems to be in your price range. They even give a discount to the whole group if anybody is a military veteran. I have never stayed at this camp but have seen it mentioned on this forum with good reviews on the camp and the fishing. I have fished Wabaskang once years ago and the walleye fishing was really good but our trip was shortened due to a death in the family so we were only there a couple of days. Here's their website peffleyscamp.com"

5233138,prov1800,2016-12-19 11:35:00,5010,"Not sure if you are stuck on the sioux lookout area or not.i do fish the area with friends and it definatly has good fishing.iam fron the vermilion bay area and our fishing here is also fantastic.seems your looking for smaller waters.i would suggest cedar lake.its 17 mi of water mostly protected from ugly weather.has real good walleye,smallmouth bass,muskie,pike and awesome crappie fishing. also cliff lake has some of the best bass fishing ive experienced.also has lake trout as well.muskies and walleye also.the walleyes are tough to get.check out ost bay resort.very resonable rates. On cedar i would check out clarkes resort.best equipment on the lake plus free bait.help youbretired guys out."
