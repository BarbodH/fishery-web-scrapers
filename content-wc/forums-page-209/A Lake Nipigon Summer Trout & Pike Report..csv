AlGonna guess that you were either down in Orient Bay (which is long and narrow like a river) or, up in Humboldt Bay staying on the Onaman River. You're not kidding about a lot of northerns either. And much of the time it's average 25-35 inchers that are caught while speck fishing. The lake does hold absolute giants though, which would equal any top pike fishery in this country. But, as you say, it's a big lake, timing can be everything, and little boats don't always have it easy on that water."

A nearly 2000 mile round trip with the boat in tow, I start out to fish and camp out of Onaman's on huge Lake Nipigon in Northern Ontario. Ten days later, I find myself guiding others and finishing up shooting an episode or two of ""The New Fly Fisher"" T.V. show on W.F.N. Highlighted by beautiful speckled trout, enormous pike, a day of quality lake trout, vibrant sunsets and some wild weather, it was a wicked good time. Crazy how it all came together perfectly eh!?!

5177809,vteye2,2016-10-31 17:41:00,123,"Great report - congrats on finding fish so quickly. My group is interested in a pike trip but have stayed away due to overwhelming size of that lake. One local outfitter has offered to set up a spike camp and bring in camp boats presuming 14-16 footers. I've glanced at the maps and looks like you could fish in leeward side of islands in sheltered bays if positioned by the outfitter in a favorable spot? Thoughts, would you fish it in a camp boat?Welcome a pm. Thanks Charlie"

5183089,Moosebunk,2016-11-02 21:04:00,211,"Hi Charlie... I answered your PM. I find pike everywhere I want, and even don't want to on that lake. The more remote the better.Quote: Originally Posted by Rich BBunk, A well written report with beautiful photos from your Onaman's fishing trip....my family and friends enjoyed reading it as well....you are truly blessed with writing skills as well as fishing abilities....congrats on another excellent trip ""up north"" and a fine write-up on same....

5183785,srj,2016-11-03 09:02:00,971,"Great report, fun to read. I haven't been to the north end but the south end is incredibly beautiful with the monstrous cliffs and the black sand beaches. It is surely different not seeing any other boats (except for the MNR/OPP cutter that checked us). I was very pleased when special regs were finally implemented on the lakers....even a body of water that big needs protection to keep a population of porkers. Along with the deep water lakers, we found mayflies hatching in mid-August in a small bay with whitefish and specks feasting on them. Lot of fun. And smaller fileted and fried whitefish are a real delicacy."

5184961,515,2016-11-03 20:01:00,254,Thanks for a great report and pics. Someday I'm going to make the trip up there just to fish and can't wait. Thanks
