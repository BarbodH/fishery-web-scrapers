Last year Went in Mid August on first fly in trip ever. Water temps were warm on the weed beds and the reservoir levels were up. Big pike seemed to be deep.We wanted to get an opportunity to get after some larger pike at shallower depths this year. I am relatively new to fly in fishing trips and fishing for pike and walleye for that matter. This site and group of people helped me out a ton preparing for this trip. It was a great success probably had one of the best father son weeks I have ever had so this is now going to be a yearly trip for us.Any insight from guys that have fished this bay before would be great. Did I pick a good location. Is the time of year right or at least around the money for nicer pike in shallow conditions. Any tips would be great."

Water levels are another big factor on Gouin as water levels seem to fluctuate from year to year. Suggest starting shallow and work your way out into greater depths till you find the bigger fish.
5222114,Hookhunter135,2016-12-08 16:25:00,129,Thanks for the tip. The guys I went with last year all really enjoyed the trip and we just would like a crack at catching some nice pike when they are more active. We caught some really great fish on the last trip but with warmer water temps and the time of year we chose it was a softer sluggish bite. Just trying to find out if I am picking the right time of year for the area I am fisbing
