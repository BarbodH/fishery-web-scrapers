5231514,Bstar,2016-12-17 11:25:00,564,"I'm thinking about swapping out the trebles on my pike spoons and spinners with a siwash hook. My question is is there a ""rule of thumb"" as far as proper sizing of the new hook? Also what's your favorite brand? Gamakatsu, Owner or VMC."
5231666,BornToFish,2016-12-17 15:00:00,1224,"Greetings,I purchased some Gamakatsu Siwash hooks yesterday, in anticipation of doing the same thing that you are contemplating. I also plan to make some in-line spinnerbaits (i.e. bucktails) this winter with single hooks, rather than trebles. I am intrigued with lures with single hooks, rather than trebles, maybe being less prone to fouling with weeds and hopefully easier to remove from fish.The hooks that I purchased yesterday happen to be #7/0 and #8/0. I will use these on larger profile spinnerbaits, for larger pike and muskies. I already had some #5/0 and #6/0 Gamakatsu Siwash hooks that will go on some spoons.I have been a believer in Gamakatsu hooks for a long time. Thus, the choice of brand of Siwash hooks was easy for me. Owner and VMC hooks are right up there with Gamakatsu. Your choice might come down to what is on the shelf in your tackle store.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

Favorite hook is the Gamakatsu open eye siwash in 5/0 and 6/0 sizes.Beyond the obvious benefit of being easier to unhook fish and hurting them less, it allows you to tip the hook with an oversized grub which often makes a big difference."
5232002,Bstar,2016-12-18 06:30:00,564,Thanks for the info guys. I figured you would chime in Mike. I wasn't sure on the size. The 5/0 looked pretty big when I was looking at them at Cabela's the other day.
5232194,Mike Borger,2016-12-18 09:18:00,1554,5/0 would be the minimum size.
5232218,BornToFish,2016-12-18 09:34:00,1224,"Greetings,I have added ""twister tail"" type soft rubber bodies to spinner baits (either in-line or bent-arm styles) with great success. These rubber bodies add considerable bulk, color and vibration to the lure. They seem to work very well for me, at least until a snot-rocket pike bites the tail off. I have been using Esox Assault Tackle's Killer Tails lately. These come in styles for both single and treble hooks.I've tried adding the Killer Tails (single hook model) to the Siwash hooks on my one ounce DareDevle spoons. I found that the rubber tails absolutely killed the side-to-side wobble of the spoons. The Killer Tail continued to do its thing coming through the water, but the spoon itself looks like a wet dish rag coming through the water. Thus, I now leave the rubber tails off the spoons with Siwash hooks.How did you overcome this phenomenon? Are you using a special size or style of soft rubber tail on the Siwash hook? Many thanks for your thoughts on these questions.Merry Christmas everyone!!"
5232482,Mike Borger,2016-12-18 16:43:00,1554,"You are absolutely correct, adding the grub will wreck the action of many spoons - I don't tip a grub on those spoons. HAHA!My favorite non weedless spoon is the Doctor Spoon. A siwash and grub works well on it. To a lesser extent the Williams Whitefish is another one I like to tip with a grub.Even those spoons don't run the same, you really need to slow down your retrieve a couple of notches.As far as what grubs, I don't use anything fancy. 5"" Mister Twister grubs work well for me. They're relatively cheap and they have a nice wide, fat profile."
