5219746,IllinoK5,2016-12-06 17:29:00,2,Hoping to get some lodging tips from anyone that has experience staying on the Minnesota side of Rainy lake. I'm looking for cheap hotels or motels only. The lakeside lodges are too expensive for my military paycheck and camping is too hard on my dad for the 5 nights we plan on fishing. Hoping to find a place with charging stations in the parking lot for the boat batteries. Plan is to launch at the Rainy Lake Visitors center. Thanks for any help.
5219810,Baseline,2016-12-06 18:34:00,3207,"There are a bunch of motels in I-Falls. I've stayed at the following. America's Best - Middle of the Road no extras The T-P It's low cost, but small rooms and a bit dated Americ Inn - Very nice, but $100 plus a nightNone of these have any kitchenettes. Not sure about charging, but some should have electrical plugins for block heaters. There are one or two other older motels along the HWY. If you can stay off of Friday nights in May and June because of the Canadian bound crowd stays overnight to get a early start to avoid the lines at the border. The motels gouge pretty good for Friday nights. Check Island View Resort on Rainy Lake. They have lodge rooms. Prices are reasonable especially if you choose the non lake view rooms. Again no ability to cook any food. They have a restaurant and bar. The bar has burgers, pizza & stuff. It is right on Rainy and you can leave your boat in the water. They have charging on the dock."
5220010,Lovetofish,2016-12-07 07:14:00,458,Look up the Falls Motel. They have a website.
5220138,That Minnesota guy,2016-12-07 08:12:00,8293,"I agree, Falls Motel fits your listed requiremements, 218-283-8434 Book early. They fill up Friday nights with guys crossing into Canada."
5220178,Shotgun,2016-12-07 08:26:00,759,"Stayed at Island View two years ago. Unless they have improved we would not return. Restaurant and service very good, view of lake great beautiful scene, nice boat dock, rooms unkept, loud rowdy vulgar group at bar outside on deck well into the night, owners didn't seem to care if we were there or not. Truck and trailer parking not very secure as bar crowd parks in same area. Didn't have any problems but was not comfortable leaving truck in this enviroment. Just telling as I saw it."
5220274,Blackmacs,2016-12-07 11:21:00,2121,x3 Falls Motel.
5222146,IllinoK5,2016-12-08 16:57:00,2,"Everyone, thanks for all the replies. Leaning towards Island View Lodge with an inland side room to avoid bar patio noise. Either way I don't care as long as my next thread is a fishing report with brag photos."
5222170,That Minnesota guy,2016-12-08 17:20:00,8293,"Interesting choice. Good luck fishing, hope you and dad make some life long memories."
5222690,Baseline,2016-12-09 07:21:00,3207,"When you make your reservation for Island View tell them you want a room further down the row and not on top of the bar. I've stayed at Island View in both cabins and lodge rooms and I agree the ownership could put some $$$ in some updates, but it is not a slum. The bar noise generally dies off around 10 pm and is non existent mid-week. At least that is the way it's been when I've been there. This would be the time to book a room because all the US Rainy resorts get booked solid during the summer. They all go to the big sport shows starting in Jan and any openings get snapped up. Schedule your trip for mid-August when the walleyes invade the big reef complexes on Seine Bay and east of the Brule Narrows and you could have an awesome trip."
