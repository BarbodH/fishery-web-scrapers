5208089,Mike Borger,2016-11-27 13:45:00,1554,"The full story on this incredible trip is now complete. Located 500 kilometers north of Sioux Lookout close to the Manitoba border, Echoing is easily the furthest north operating lodge within the province. It's the literal definition of remote.Newly opened to the public this year its waters have rarely been fished. Nearby lakes accessible by camp float plane are still unknown and unfished. It'll be up to future guests to discover their bounty because I didn't have time. Fishing was nuts, and we caught large numbers of lake trout, pike and walleye including a number of trophy sized fish.You can see the full story here along with a whole lot of photos and 31 embedded video clips - by far the most I've ever put together for a trip. Not surprising because it was easily the most fish I've ever caught in week. http://www.canadafishingguide.net/fi...st-frontier-2/Cheers, Mike"

5208458,Mike Borger,2016-11-28 04:27:00,1554,"Joy is a pretty apt word, that place was really something."
5208698,ziggyzag,2016-11-28 09:25:00,125,Mike: Thanks for the great report I enjoyed it very much. Echoing Lake Camp is definitely on my Bucket List. When you planning on going back maybe I could tag along.
5208826,Mike Borger,2016-11-28 10:40:00,1554,"I would love to fish it again, but honestly I couldn't tell you when or if it'll happen. My travel is already pretty much booked for next year and partially for 2018 already!My fear is by the time I make a return trip none of the lakes will be virgin anymore."
5209050,retire55,2016-11-28 14:05:00,1029,Another great report and pics Mike - especially the lake trout pics. Thanks for providing us a peak at remote northern Ontario.
5209098,bthomas3333,2016-11-28 14:37:00,465,You have a fantastic track record so it would be interesting to hear what you are thinking for 2017?

Misekumaw Lake outpost with Milton Lake Lodge June 23-July 1. Gangler's Burnie Lake outpost July 22-29. Edmund Lake outpost with Elk Island Lodge, August 15-23. North Caribou Lake Sept 16-23. Have a couple of options lined up for mid May and mid October, not 100% sure on those trips yet. Will be another great year of travel for sure!

Being able to access those truly remote fly-in lakes from the lodge is such an amazing bonus. Not many lodges are able to offer that. A group of 8+ and that place is a really great deal. I think a 10+ day trip would be ideal though As I read your report, I wondered if this might have been one of your more challenging pieces to write. It has to be easier to write about a trip when you spend a significant amount of time exploring a lake looking for active or trophy fish. I mean, what can you really say when you hit the jackpot every day?Catching Lakers and Pike like it was a good day of Walleye fishing. Just insane. Where else can you even do that?"
