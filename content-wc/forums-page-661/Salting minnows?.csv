Then intill I use them place them in the freezer. On cold spring or falls days, sure beats putting your hands in the cold water all the time..."

564351,Guest,2007-04-06 19:26:00,0,I tried salting the minnows and they get stiff and shrivel up. Also fatheads turned black. Last year we tried the Borax soap and they turned out fine. As the last post stated get all the water off the minnows and roll them in Borax then freeze them.
