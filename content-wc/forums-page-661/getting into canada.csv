564201,Dacotah Eye,2007-03-31 11:45:00,2722,I think it would be harder to spot people in the bush of Canada than the desert in the southern US.
564241,Guest,2007-04-02 15:07:00,0,"Driver's license and/or birth certificate (certified/orignal preferred),should be all you need. Pass port is still a good idea, since they last for 10 years. I am sure your son will be seeking employnemt in the next ten years and with all the regulations being imposed on business regarding proof of citizenship, the pass port is a valuable asset to show you are a U.S. citizen. It also gives the impression of ""having your act together""; which is sometimes not easy for a young adult to project. Remember, many times, ""kids"" can travel under their parent's pass port, ""Adults"" cannot. This maybe an opportunity to impliedly tell your son that he's a man now. I am sure you will agree that we should never pass up a chance to affirm our childern's self worth and importance....even if there is still a lot of child still left in them. By the way it's great that you are taking your son!"

564308,Dacotah Eye,2007-04-05 14:55:00,2722,"Naw, I don't think the desert in the south just starts and ends at ours either. lol It is getting to be kind of a pain to go back and forth though. The last time I came back from Ontario they wouldn't even let us get out of our vehicle. :cheers:"

564363,Guest,2007-04-07 13:32:00,0,"I live in Il. and have taken my 2 boys with me to Canada for the past 3 years. I just simply went to the Il. drivers license facility and obtained picture ID's for them. It cost as I recall $4.00 each and it's a state issued ID which is acceptable at the border on both sides. You do need their birth certificates and social security cards to get the ID's. Check the drivers license facility in your state for requirements. Also, it will be wise to get a notarized letter from the mother saying it is ok to take the child into Canada. The Canadian customs, depending on the officer, could make it difficult to cross the border with a minor without permission from both parents. Make sure it's a notarized letter. I will be getting my kids passports renewed this spring because obviously we will be needing them in 2008. If you drive as stated in previous posts, it's ok with a picture ID. If you fly, you definitely will need passports. The state issued ID is best. Plus,the kids like it because it looks like a drivers license. The memories that your children will have fishing in Canada will last a lifetime, which we all know,""Life moves faster than time itself"". Have Fun! Don't forget the bug spray!"
564366,Guest,2007-04-07 14:40:00,0,Here in NW Ontario it's common to have guys pulled over by Police and then run into the bush. Standard operating procedure is for the officers to hang back and a little while later they all surrender. They also take them in for a blood transfusion. Terrorists shlepping stuff through the bush here is comical.
564423,Guest,2007-04-10 21:08:00,0,Contact Canadian Customs and get the straight poop instead of everybody's opinion.
564132,Guest,2007-03-27 18:42:00,0,Need a little help. Is it this year that we US citizens have to have a pass-port to get into Canada or is that down the road a couple of years. I already have them but a friend of mine wants to take his son up and wants to know if they need them. Thanks for your help. walleye fred
564133,guidedfishing,2007-03-27 18:54:00,531,No not this year if entering by vehicle. GF
564134,Springseeker,2007-03-27 19:07:00,96,You don't need a passport to get into Canada but I think you need one to reenter the US.
564135,Sutsgold,2007-03-27 19:10:00,219,If you are flying you will need one this year. If driving you do not need one until Jan 08.
564144,wooglin,2007-03-28 12:35:00,371,"Please discuss. I do not believe a passport is needed to get into Canada or into the US (coming back home) if by vehichle, until 2008. Correct?"
564145,jigman 2003,2007-03-28 13:39:00,981,"correct, but it could make going both ways much quicker for you (and those of us in line behind you)."
564161,Guest,2007-03-29 08:43:00,0,what about kids under 18?? do they need passports if you fly?
564167,jigman 2003,2007-03-29 10:23:00,981,"Everybody needs one, at least that's my understanding. I believe it is the same for everyone returning from the Caribbean."
564169,Guest,2007-03-29 11:19:00,0,How many others out there don't understand the logic behind beefing up security at the vehicle access points into Canada and back into the United States. In my opinion the real threats to security on either side would NOT bother using the vehicle entry points they would use the miles upon miles of unguarded wilderness that divide the United States and Canada. My brother spent two weeks on the Minnesota boundary waters last Summer and when he returned I couldn't wait to ask him what he noticed in terms of beefed up security there. He's been going up there for the past twenty years and told me he didn't notice any differences dating back to his first trip back in 1984. When will both governments exercise a little common sense or is that an impossible expectation when it comes to government?
564178,jigman 2003,2007-03-29 13:54:00,981,"While your post does make some sense, there is nothing we're going to be able to do about the miles of vast wilderness. If some terrorists want to lug some stuff through the Canadian bush, then they'll do it. However, we can control the established points of entry. Seems to make sense to me. Where else on Earth can you travel from one country to another without a passport?"
