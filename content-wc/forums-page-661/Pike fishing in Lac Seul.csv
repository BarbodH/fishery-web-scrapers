564348,JDP,2007-04-06 14:08:00,1457,"Actually Northern Pike season is ""Open All Year"" on Lac Seul/Division 30. If a person only wants to fish Pike, you could look for a resort that is open just after ice out. Hopefully that would/could be anywhere from 1-3 weeks before walleye opening on May 19th. :cheers:"
564205,5richards,2007-03-31 15:23:00,131,"Hello Everyone, I am looking to head up to Lac Seul with 6-8 guys for a fishing trip this year. We are really interested in getting into some good pike fishing and walleyes second. I know this is a great walleye lake, but we are really interested in the pike. I have heard that the best time for pike is close to ice out in early spring. But I am by no means an expert here. I am looking for some advice. Would love to find when the pike are hitting good when they are in the shallow waters and bays. Any suggestions on the right time to come up for them? Also, any advice would be greatly appreciated on what part of this big lake to stay at and good lodges as well. Thanks for your time!"
564213,Guest,2007-04-01 06:32:00,0,I won't say there are no pike in lac suel but we sure haven't caught very many the last few years. If you don't have your reservation for your trip locked in by now you may have trouble finding an opening.
564226,Guest,2007-04-02 07:57:00,0,"The way it sounds, the water will be very low. That will take out the possibility of getting in some of the shallow bays."
564237,Guest,2007-04-02 14:17:00,0,"Been fishing Lac Seul for years. There are plenty of Pike avaliable. I like the first two weeks in July for Pike because the weed cover is good but not to heavy. Fishing the weed beds can yield lots of Pike but they are usally not real big ( 2lbs to 6lbs). Don't be afraid to work timber bays that can be good too. Fish the first drop away from the weed bed and get on the bottom with a slow roll spinner bait or a 4""to5"" swim bait. Big toothy critters like those spots. Pike will also be caught in Walleye water....who doesent like to eat a Walleye every now and then?"
564264,schick,2007-04-03 19:38:00,35,"We hit it perfect last year in the last week of May catching the pike in the shallows. The three of us caught 250 and my youngest son caught one 41.5. We caught several 36-39. We noticed during that week that our numbers slowly receded, so it appeared they were moving to deeper water during that week. I am concerned about the water being low this year and what it will do to our normal spots. We experienced that a few years ago, so I hardly recognized some of the spots. We will be there again last week of May. NE Piker"
564272,Mark R,2007-04-04 07:09:00,1538,That's alot o pike What part of the lake did you catch all these pike?
564279,Guest,2007-04-04 10:54:00,0,...and what were your gang's go-to lures for catching these Northerns? Thanks!
564301,Mark R,2007-04-05 08:15:00,1538,"Seriously, I haven't caught 250 northern in the last ten years I have been going to LacSuel. We mostly go in August but this year we have the 1st week in June. We fish out of Evergreen Lodge so maybe it's that end of the lake. I'm bringing a couple new guys that have never fished for walleye or pike so any tips on location of baits etc would help and be apprecaited. Thanks"

Big Pike on Lac Suel can be caught in the summertime if you go out on main lake points, and fight the wind. Those girls are deep after mid-June, and you have to go down the deep edges to find them. If you want small pike in the 2-6 lb range then go ahead and fish the shallow weeds anytime. Those snakes are always there."
