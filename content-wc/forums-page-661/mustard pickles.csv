564245,yellowned,2007-04-02 16:48:00,39,I'm sure this is going to be a strange question but I need your help. In June I'll be vacationing in southern Ontario around lansdowne. A friend of mine asked me if I would bring him back (usa) a couple of jars of pickles in a mustard sauce. He said some even have onions in them with the pickles and mustard. He told me that they are very common in Canada. I personally never heard of them. Has anyone ever heard of them and if so can you please give me the brand name and possible place to purchase them. Thanks so much signed confused!!

They are very good and they are not hot. When you pick them up for your buddy grab a jar for you, they are very good."
