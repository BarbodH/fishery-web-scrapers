564086,jigman 2003,2007-03-23 06:36:00,981,Best tip I'd give you would be to get a detailed map of the area.
564106,Sutsgold,2007-03-25 09:20:00,219,"While up there i found a backroads map at Bobby's in Vermillon. Very detailed, however, it is mostly for people who canoe. Hard to find details on where you can or can not launch a fishing boat."
564109,Trailerguy,2007-03-25 19:40:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]What do you require in a boat launch facility? There are few paved launch sites that would accomadate a boat you'd feel good about being out on lake Erie in. But a 14' Lund and a couple of young backs can get in lots of places. Area maps sometimes have launchs marked, but I've seen some marked sites that you couldn't get in with a 4X4 and a 14' boat on a trailer. There are plenty of day trip opportunitys, depending on your ability to get there and what you expect when you do get there. I've never seen a ""honey hole"" lake with a nice ramp, they tend to be pretty inaccesable or somebody would have already caught the fish. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
564181,Guest,2007-03-29 14:21:00,0,"There are quite a few of the lakes you are looking for, but I'm 100% sure none of the lakes have a boat landing. Canoes work about the best. Some times the resorts up that way have outpost lakes they have primitive access to and allow day trips. These can be fun. Check with the resorts in the areas you have interest. They know the lay of the land the best."
564358,5thsuit,2007-04-07 08:53:00,54,"For years we basecamped out of Manitou Falls Camp and everyother day we took my Gruman sportman canoe and 4hp merc down the gravel looking for untouched lakes. Its a young mans game, but the fishing can be great! Forget about boat launches,bring a GPS, you might have to walk 1/2 mile though the bush to get to a lake,or paddle a couple of miles up a small creek!! I almost forgot to mention portageing over Falls and beaver dams. Check out all the regulations involving, where you can camp, have an open flame or park for the day. A good map is also a must, with a case of beer we were able to talk a logger out of his map, showing roads and proposed roads. If you do it have fun, I use to tell my buddies its not a fishing trip its an adventure! For the last 10 years we fly in and I feel a lot better when I return."
564359,Sutsgold,2007-04-07 09:26:00,219,"Thanks for the info. I guess what were looking for are smaller walleye lakes without resorts or many cottages, but with boat launches. I would imagine there would be quite a few up there that you do not hear of because lodges are not posting info on them."
564361,Oldschool,2007-04-07 10:34:00,163,"Folks, I have had some day trips with the lodges up there. It is very good fishing usually, but sometimes it's just nice to go somewhere on your own; the 'wilderness' experience one might say. What is the policy on using the logging roads in the area? Is any road that is accessbile okay for public use? If it is a true logging road, one that is not necessarily marked nor maintained for the average vehicle, is it okay to use. That is, are they not the private property of the logging company? The last thing that I want to do in a foreign country is step on legal toes. I would rather forego some fishing opportunities than run afoul of anyone, whether it's legislative law or unwritten code. Thanks much, Roy"
564362,5thsuit,2007-04-07 11:19:00,54,"In the area northwest of Ear Falls it would be rare to find a small lake with a launch. They also no longer clearcut right down to the lake which makes it difficult to even find the lakes. GPS and a map is a must. Some logging roads are posted for authorized use only, others can be driven on, however you may not be able to park along the road."
