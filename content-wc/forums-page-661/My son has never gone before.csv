564204,jerry bark,2007-03-31 15:20:00,822,"hey somebody posted about the first trip for his wife, a great read BTW,. this year my 10 year old is going for the first time. the camp is decided, they have a game room with a tv and nintendo so we should not have a major problem there. drive in so a mid week sightseeing trip is planned also. he usually likes to fish for about two to three hours at a time, longer than that and he gets tired. I am planning on 2-3 hours on my super reliable morning spot, shore breakfast/lunch-break-time-exploring for a while hopefully another hour or two fishing then long afternoon break in camp for fun/dinner and then fish the last hour or two of the evening near camp. one of the ohter guys is bringing his 14 year old too. what do you suggest i think about in preparation? i have been to this camp every year since 2000, so i know a lot of spots, i also know a lot of spots that i want to try out. i figure this year will be a laid back year compared to most(the other guys in camp call me the ""machine"" LOL) so i will definately need to slow down some for my son. he is most excited about going into a portage lake that i have arranged with the owner. thanks, jerry"
564209,FISHNBOWLJOE,2007-03-31 21:45:00,80,"Sounds like you have a prety good plan. Just be flexible. There might not be any other kids, and he could get bored. He might end up wanting to fish with you all day. You never know. I remember the first time my father in-law and I took my son fishing in my father in-laws boat. He was about six or seven. My father in-law was worried because he had problems when he took some of his buddies kids fishing. My son ended up sitting in the front of the boat all day long. He never really said a word all day long while my father in-law and I did our usual thing. Fishing a while, bsing a while. You know the drill. My son just fished. When we headed home at the end of the day, we realized he out fished us both. He did the same thing when he was old enough to go uo north with ""the guys""for a week. He was fifteen or sixteen then. He had a better week than me, my brother in-law and fater in-law. You just never know. Whatever the case, I hope you both have a great trip and that it will be the first of many for the two of you. Good luck and great fishing. Joe PS By the way, where are you headed? Just wondered."

564215,Guest,2007-04-01 07:10:00,0,"Both my kids have been going to Canada since the age of 9. Your plan is very solid, so the I have only one addition: take things to do in the boat. At that age, even when the fish are biting the attention can wander. By having things to do in the boat, you can spend more time fishing rather than heading in when the kids get restless. Books, paint (watercolor), toys, etc., we did them all and it was a huge help. Finally (OK two things), don't forget toilet paper and lots of snacks. Like I said, even when the fish are biting, sometimes they get restless. I recall one day when the walleyes were hitting good, my son decided to play with the toys. When I asked why not fish now when the fish were biting, his response was ""they are always biting up here."" I learned my lesson of not trying to apply either logic or my will on him. Today, six years later at the age of 15 he is now the better fisherman and I have a great partner! His sister is only 11 and ultimately she will be even better than both he and I! Have a great trip...IA Walleye"
564216,rpieske,2007-04-01 09:05:00,1276,"My father started taking me up to Canada when I was ten (54 years ago). I started my son when he was ten (21 years ago). I think what my son enjoyed most was the freedom he was given and the responsibility he had to assume with that freedom. I always let my son drive the boat during the day. I let him decide where we would fish that day and discuss the reasons for his decision. He never tired of fishing and would always make the last cast of the day. Now he comes up each summer with his own boat and we fish in his boat and mine. He is a great fisherman and looks forward to the day when he can bring his son up. (Only nine more years to go.) By the time he was twelve, I would let him take the boat out by himself or with one of his friends. He was always responsible and enjoyed making decisions. That's one of the conundrums of life.... You raise your kids to make decisions, taking responsibility for the results, guiding them and mentoring them so they are confident, decisive young adults. The result is that they become confident young people who make their own decisions...and don't need you anymore. That's both the wonderful part and the melancholy part of parenting. I believe the family that fishes together stays together. It has worked for us. Congratulations on your choice for including your son in your recreational time. It is the best opportunity for passing on your value system to him. Kids learn more from what they see you doing, than what you say."
564217,Guest,2007-04-01 11:45:00,0,My dad started taking me when I was 7(30 years ago). If i got tired i would curl up on the boat seat and take a nap. Other than that I was fishing the whole time. I am such a lucky man for having had a dad and grandpa that took me to canada fishing. WHat great memories--have fun and enjoy it!!
564222,jerry bark,2007-04-01 17:25:00,822,"IA walleye thanks for the reply, i will make up a ziplock bag with some books, toys and art supplies since he like to draw. snacks are a given in my boat, and i keep a few partial rolls of toilet paper in food saver bags in the front locker for just those occasions, LOL I think i will get him a couple of disposable cameras too, he like to take pictures and mom will like having them for her scrapbooks. cheers jerry"
564223,jerry bark,2007-04-01 17:29:00,822,"Bob, thanks for the thoughtful reply, I agree that family building is more important than me catching more fish. I had been thinking he might like to learn to drive the boat, and there are plenty of places up there where he can drive it and there is not much to hit. he should be able to learn to run the bow mount for casting the shorelines for pike and smallies too. thanks again jerry"
564234,Guest,2007-04-02 13:44:00,0,"Canadians do not build silly rock piles (inukshuks)....it is as you mentioned, Americans like yourselves stopping for piss breaks. This should clear up the mystery and reduce the prestige of these ""rock piles""....of which we Canadians really dislike because of all the questions we get asked about them. D"
564235,Guest,2007-04-02 13:50:00,0,"Lots of great ideas here. Started my son at 9 (now 16), he sometimes would curl up on the floor of the boat and take a snooze. Action and participation, and comfort - action and participation whether driving the boat, running the troller, casting for small (or large) northerns with buzzbaits, and the like. Or going ashore and exploring a bit. Comfort - staying warm & dry. Adequate and comfortable clothes, raingear, & life jacket. We make the rock piles too - have done so for years, marking them with the handheld gps along the drive. It's been a great experience - a lifetime of memories for both of us. We've gone with a group of friends over the years, which makes it more interesting as well. Enjoy. John"
564238,Lovetofish,2007-04-02 14:34:00,458,"My wife and I started taking our two kids when they were 8 and 6. I was nervous about that first trip. We talked often with them about the long ride and everthing that goes with it, trying to prepare them I guess. Also, back then, our kids could remember what it was like not having mom & dad around for a week....so they wanted to go....and we wanted to bring them. They did great and now anticipate the return every summer. What helps is that other members of our group bring their kids. Some are older and some are younger. We take time off every day to relax and let them have fun on a beach. They bring along a portable DVD (with head phones)to watch movies with while on the road or in the cabin. They also bring CD players and books etc. in a back pack for the boat. They still need to be kids. Now my son is old enough to help drive up and to run the boat. I'm glad we started them young. To me, bringing my family is ""priceless"". Good luck."
564240,Guest,2007-04-02 15:02:00,0,My brother and I have been taking our sons since 1st grade. That is when our dad started us. This will be our 4 yr and the most important thing is to make sure they are warm and dry. So please do not skimp on the rain gear and cold weather gear. If they are comfortable they will have fun. We also concentrate on walleye but do let them chuck for northerns during the middle of the day. Also footballs baseballs etc. on the sand or at camp seem to help them get rid of extra energy. Another thing we do is travel up in the night set the boys up so they can sleep and take turns driving makes the trip up faster for them. Have a great trip we always do Later
564243,Guest,2007-04-02 16:07:00,0,"Destroyer: I did not call them silly. Silly is defined by the Bum's fishing style. Counting the days and working on my ""Canadian"". How is this: ""My brother and I used to say that drownin' in beer was like heaven, eh?"" Is the Bum working this year at Elinsore Brewery? Sorry, Jerry, this tack has definately taken a different turn, but I applaud you taken your kids. You will find it challenging at times, but very rewarding both in the short run and the long!. IA Walleye"
564244,Guest,2007-04-02 16:20:00,0,"the best thing you can do is teach your child, and teach him/her well and with patience. whether you are trolling or casting or jigging, they must learn to do it correctly. take time to properly instruct them at the beginning of the week, and by day two, its a breeze. ive also done this with older women in my group(mom, mom in law and aunt) we had a riot at andy lake resort.(we had hot tub on our deck and beach right in front of our cabin..cool set up)make sure they bring game boys and books and plenty of snacks!! in boat and day will be awesome.. also take a little time to observe the beauty of canada and do some swimming if weather permits.. movies in the cabin at night with tv we brought from home also is a great idea as ""the guys"" wanted to partake in texas holdem and some livations, if you know what i mean. also give them some chores for the week to make them feel(which they are) part of the trip.make sure they understand the drag system on the reel they will be using as this is probably the most important of all..be a good parent, and you will have good kids...bender waitin on june 2nd....ouuut!!!"
564298,jerry bark,2007-04-04 20:10:00,822,"Another thanks to all who have posted here. You have helped me to identify a few things that i need to be sure to cover. Rain gear for example! and maybe a foodsaver bag with some dry clothes stashed in the forward locker just in case?? You have also reassured me that a lot of what i had thought of was on track. I'll post a report when we get back inc ase anyone is interested. we usually stay over at blueberry hill campground and hotel on the way up, hit the pool and/or sauna and get a good nights sleep. DVD player goes with us on our family camping trips so got that covered. chuckin' for pike/smallies will be going on. that time of year the smallies are usually hot to trot on the sandy sides of the islands. tonight he asked if he can bring his tent and camp out. I said sure, how about we both camp out on an island somewhere? so that may be a fun deal. Thanks again to all, and enjoy your own trips with your kids this year too. cheers jerry"
564230,Guest,2007-04-02 09:52:00,0,"Jerry No problem. The only other thing I did not mention is that on the trip up, we break that up by staying overnight one night. I live in NW Iowa, so the the trip to where we go is about 13 hours. It's definately doable in one day (in fact the trip home is a straight shot). However, going north, we drive about 8 - 9 hours the first day and then sleep in a motel. The next day is short, more fun things to see once you pass the border, such as wildlife near or on the road, lots of boats to look at being towed, and those rock piles the Canadians seem to like to to pile near the road. In fact, speaking of the latter, make sure you build one of those yourself. What we do is find a logging road to pull off (we are on Highway 502). While the adults empty our bladders, the kid(s) build their own rock pile. We mark it with a tree branch (dead of course), so we know which is ours so we can see it on the ride home. We had one that lasted a couple of years and the kid(s) got a kick out of that. As to motel, I find one with a pool, so the kids can have a splash before a week in the wilderness (we go in spring and the water is too cold to swim in at the resort we go to). The ride the next days is short and we get in in the early PM, have time to unload and even get in a ocuple of hours of afternoon fishing before dinner. We arrive rested and in good spirts for a great week. It adds a day to the vacation, but with small children and a aging grandparent, it makes that week much more enjoyable than driving straight through. Coming home, its a straight shot. We leave very early and everybody but the driver sleeps the first 3 - 4 hours. The only other thing we do for the drive up is we have the portable DVD players for movies. However, the rule is once we hit the camp, no DVD or CD players are allowed to be turned on. We are there to enjoy the wilds and each other, not to watch Mutant Turtles. The only time I broke that rule is one day when it rained non-stop so hard that nobody left the dock for the entire day. Have a great trip. If every parent took their kids fishing with the attitude you have, the world would be a richer place. IA Walleye"
564233,Guest,2007-04-02 11:28:00,0,"A dad from another cabin brought his son maybe 9 or 10.As we were talking he said his son was bored to death,I asked how were you fishing he said they anchored on a point and jigging and catching walleyes.I told him to go to a weedy bay and try casting for pike on topwaters, the constant action will keep his interest and his first boatside strike will last a long time. The look on his face when his lure gets smashed even by a small pike will be priceless. I still keep 1 rod rigged with a buzz bait or zarra spook in the boat at all times. Terry"
