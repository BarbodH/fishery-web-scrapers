563992,Hump,2007-03-19 08:03:00,578,Gary: Do you think the lake level will be low on Lac Seul.
564000,Guest,2007-03-19 11:34:00,0,"If conditions don't change much, yes it will be on the low side. We have to be patient and see what the Man upstairs does for us; just hope for spring rain. Low water conditions have me nervous about my bait lakes as well; our only hope is that with the snow cover, we have/had only 30"" of ice this year; that the winter kill is minimal."
564008,Guest,2007-03-19 19:06:00,0,"don't know, don't care. going up the 3rd week of august. should be out by then."
564044,Guest,2007-03-21 17:33:00,0,Early this year by the nesting birds and critters. Lots of ice but little snow. I figure third week of April. We saw a Robin two weeks ago already.
564428,Guest,2007-04-11 10:16:00,0,ttt how is it looking in the dryden area in general or lower manitou lake specifically thanks 7 weeks till we go eric macdonald
564431,Guest,2007-04-11 14:10:00,0,there is still 3 feet of ice on the lakes here in NWO (red lake area). the local boat dealer thinks we should be in the water by June.

563928,Guest,2007-03-15 21:34:00,0,"ice out varies,generally by mid april ice is breaking up and starting to sink on the inland lakes, and lk. nipigon and other large ,deep,area lakes following about 2 weeks behind. this yr. we had a milder than usual winter resulting in less ice accumulation,combined with an early spring and its looking like the ice will be off most area lakes by mid april as they are allready starting to break up. the onaman river is already open at our boat launch and humboldt bay always offers some fantastic ice-out trout."

563979,gary at evergreen,2007-03-18 15:37:00,3,"Gary here at Ear Falls; we have 30""+ of ice yet and 16-18"" of snow with more today, cold weather near 0F the next couple nights; so will post more when the weather begins to make a real change."
563986,Greg @ ABL,2007-03-18 21:19:00,23,"While the winter was mild, there is still a decent ice build up. Hard to say at this time what will happen, if its a wet and early spring... ice will be out early... dry and cold, ice will be slow to move out. Should have a decent idea by early April.
