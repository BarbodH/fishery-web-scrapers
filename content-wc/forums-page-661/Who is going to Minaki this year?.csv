I again will be in Minaki from June 1st to the 9th and August 10th to the 19th in cabin 6 at Paridise Cove II, stop in and BS for awhile. (I always have somthing to talk over) I have been going to Minaki for 33 years. Don"

I've been there in May, June, July, August,and September over the years. I have to say the 70's had the best fishing ever and the system has slowly declined ever since. Last year I fished Minaki, the English River at Caribou Falls, and Lac Seul out of Ear Falls. The English River and Lac Seul blew away Minaki for fishing. I love Minaki and the area, but, I love to catch fish Canadian style, which means not running all over the place to catch a few fish. I'm giving Minaki a rest for a few years until the fish repopulate that system. I'm sticking with a week at the English River and a week in Lac Seul in July. I'll catch more fish there in the two weeks than I have in the past 5 plus years in Minaki altogether. Good luck out there! I love Minaki and always will, but the numbers aren't there anymore."

564265,Guest,2007-04-03 19:47:00,0,"Our group is heading up the last week of July, we used to fish the area a couple of times a year but, with the walleyes struggling we headed to other waters for several years. I sure hope that the area has started to recover as I love this area and have fished it for over 30 years. I have also got the muskie bug and look forward to some evenings on the water chasing a 50""er"
564266,Guest,2007-04-03 19:50:00,0,We have just booked for the week of July 14. We have been there every year but usually in the middle of June. Decided to try a different time because fishing was not the best in June for us the past 2 years. We are hoping the walleyes are biting in Big Sand and Little Sand instead of upstream.
564271,Guest,2007-04-04 06:04:00,0,We'll be there mid-June to the end of the month. ...just like we have for the past 20+ years. Chuck

564304,IaCraig,2007-04-05 11:31:00,434,"We are skipping Minaki in 2007 for the first time in ?? years, because of other time & money comittments. My 2 cents is the fishing in 2006 was much better than 2004 or 2005, so if they don't mess with the water levels 2007 should be good also. I am sure the reduced eye limits and fishing pressure is helping it come back too. Good luck to you all IaCraig"
