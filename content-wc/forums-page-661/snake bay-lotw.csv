564465,Guest,2007-04-12 22:21:00,0,"Hi. we stayed at that lodge once, it was very nice as i remember. the bays inside have a lot of nice northers. as you pass out of the bay just pass the power lines in that channel in the evening people would troll for walleyes. yellow girl is too far just for 4 fish."

564267,Flip Silverlake,2007-04-03 21:05:00,645,"Yellowgirl Bay, Sunset Channel, Deadbroke Channel, north of Sioux Narrows the water darkens a lot fishing is fairly easy. The water in Whitefish Bay is super clear and I found it really tough to fish there. Your looking at a 25 mile one way trip. In one week I put 497.5 miles on my boat (as indicated on my GPS)fishing north of Sioux Narrows. I hit Yellowgirl Bay mostly. Lots of Bass and Northerns in Snake Bay. You really need a good GPS with the maping feature to get around there. Snake Bay is not marked like the main channels are, and there are a bunch on lower unit killers down there."
564268,Flip Silverlake,2007-04-03 21:06:00,645,I only fish for Walleyes. Whitefish Bay is really good early for Lakers
564270,dewyg,2007-04-04 05:56:00,1006,"That is a tough time of year to fish for walleye, it all depends on how late the ice is off and the spawn conditions etc... I usually fish for walleye around my house in the Kenora area. The lakers will be still biting pretty heavy in the whitefish area. If you wait till it is a little closer to the date you can email me at [email protected] and I will update you on the local conditions, and give spot on the spot locations."

564339,Ia Walihntr,2007-04-06 06:46:00,320,It is at least a 20 to 30 minute ride with a 60hp from Grassy to the mechanical portage in Turtle Bay. It's a chore to operate the portage even with a small boat. It's probably another 20 minutes from the portage to Snake Bay. Is it worth going to Sabaskong Bay to fish? Definently! (my opinion) Marv
564340,Guest,2007-04-06 08:12:00,0,Walleyes on Whitefish Bay can be great. Your camp operator should be able to put you on fish. Not big numbers of walleyes but trophy chances all the time. Portage is tough and maybe not usable if the water is low. Yellow girl is a long way to go and we go there only if Whitefish is really unpredictable. Have a good time.
564342,downriverbob,2007-04-06 08:30:00,880,"Whitefish Bay has a lot of good fishing for other species other than walleye, the bass fishing can be very good with catches of 30-40 bass possible. There are many large northern pike also they can be caught by casting and trolling. Lake trout are plentiful, they can be caught by jigging and trolling also. Yhe one fish that the others did not mention is the musky, there are world record musky in Whitefish Bay, I have seen them. You don't catch a ton of them but the average fish is in the 40"" range. Walleye can be caught but they can be few and far between, especially early in the season. BOB"
564357,Guest,2007-04-07 08:36:00,0,"I would think Snake bay would be good that time of year. If your heading out from Sioux Narrows I would try Lobstick bay or Long bay. They will also be good that time of year. Whitefish may have bigger fish but don't know where they'll be as won't be on the humps yet?!! Good luck, Dennis"
