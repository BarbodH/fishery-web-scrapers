I heard that fish can be caught early in the spring. How early? Any advice or expertise would be appreciated. We'll be coming from Manitoba. reply here or email [email protected]"

564343,Mahumba,2007-04-06 08:58:00,345,Hi Eric. Are you targeting walleye in the Nipigon River? It is closed in the River. As for the Lake I believe it closes on the 15th of April. But I'll confirm that for ya. Roger Mayer
564344,Guest,2007-04-06 08:59:00,0,There is great fishing in the spring on the Nipigon. Several of the fella's I work with fish it and do well. I do not fish trout. There are several access points but no overnight camping allowed. I would check with OMNR in their Nipigon office. I have fished the river in the fall and we did very well. The river is unpredictable with water flow and such. OPG has on line monitoring of their dams and you will be able to see flow. Hope this helps.
