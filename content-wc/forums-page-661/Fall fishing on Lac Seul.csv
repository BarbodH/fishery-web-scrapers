We are thinking about trying fall fishing on the lake, and were wondering what experiences others have had with fall fishing. We are thinking about going after Labor Day, and fishing the west end of Lac Seul. We may have up to 12 people going, so are looking for a camp that accomodates 12 in larger cabins. Any information that you can provide regarding fishing success and recommendations for camps would be greatly appreciated."

Perhaps October may be better. You want to avoid getting there to early in September, before or during turnover,to really use fall patterns. Best presentation was jig and large minnow combination. Vertical jigging in deeper water. Definitley no crowds. But the days are shorter. Fall is my favorite time to fish Lac Seul, the best if you can arrange to watch the NFL games with the lodge owner! As far as reorts, lodges , camps, etc there are many on the west side. You can search the archives for Lac Seul resorts. Hope this was helpful."
