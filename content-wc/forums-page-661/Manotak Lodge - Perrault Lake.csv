I haven't done much fishing in the last 15 years so I'm starting new. I'm heading to Cabela's this weekend so any advice on gear would be appreciated. From all I've heard, Manotak is a great place."

564059,Oldschool,2007-03-22 12:34:00,163,"Perrault Lake in a nice lake to spend a week on. It is fairly round, gets up to about 85 ft deep, and has some nice areas to vary the structure. It is not the best fishing lake due to much pressure, but it can hold some fish and a hard day's fishing should let you have some success. Seems the smallmouth fishing these last few years has been pretty good, but there are walleyes and northerns there as well. Early in the year when you're going try Spadina Lake: it's accessible via a very short creek and is usually easy unless the water level is really low. There's an island on the north side there that is good for walleye. Another option early is to go into the Ord river and maybe up into Church Lake, just a short drive up the river. By the way, if you have time take a ride up the river for about an hour and see the beauth up there. There's a lake way up in there (Lost Lake, I think) that could be good fishing. Usually you'll see some wildlife up there (no dancing girls, just moose and such.):shame: Try jackfish bay on the south side of Perrault. I have never caught anything really big, but I sure stayed busy one day with small walleyes. Just outside the entrance to jackfish bay, on the east is a wide area of weeds. It will not be grown in much early, but I had luck casting for northerns there one bright sunny day in the middle of summer. Outside of that just try around the islands, checking for structure. Most islands have sand that slopes into deeper water gradually, but a few dropoffs can be found. Try those. Probably not much early in the year, but you may find some smallmouth there. You can take a nice easy trip (about 30 minutes) up into Cedar lake. It can be decent for walleyes, and many people tout the muskie fishing there. It is a totally diffent lake from Perrault in that it has many bays and outshoots from the two main lakes, East and West Cedar. It can be a really nice way to spend some time, and if Perrealt isn't working, try it. We used a lot of spinners for backtrolling and used mostly nightcrawlers. There can be times when minnows work better, but usually worms are good. In the summer some jigging off of deep water humps and structure around the islands is good. Early you might try the entrance into Spadina and aroung the outflow of Ord Lake. Good luck, and have a good time. Roy"
