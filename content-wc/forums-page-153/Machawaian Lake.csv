5087057,fsz,2016-08-28 08:04:00,144,"I have a book from 1998 from the ""north american fishing club"" that describes this lake, but not in great detail. The primary author, Dick Sternberg, describes a trip he took there with pickle lake outposts i believe in the late 90's. I have never seen that lake name mentioned on this forum, and in the past when i checked pickle lake outposts the lake wasn't listed as being available. I believe Sternberg also fished seul quite a bit (he's from minnesota). Not sure about his status, or if he's on this board or not."

5087233,Crede,2016-08-28 10:13:00,134,"6 of us fished Machawaian in late August in the late 90's after reading Dick Sternberg's article ""Burn The Book"" in Walleye Insider. The article described how he and Jim Corbett sight-fished shallow water walleye late in the prior season at Machawaian. Jim Corbett was the owner of Trophy Fish Outposts out of Armstrong. Machawaian eventually became one of Wilderness North's outposts in the mid-2000's for 2 seasons. My recollections: 1) Mr. Corbett described Machawaian as more of a walleye lake than a pike lake. Said that Keezhik (one of his other lakes) was his best pike lake. In retrospect, I am pretty certain that Machawaian has a healthy pike population given it's size and structure. Our guys were all walleye fisherman and made no attempt to catch pike. 2) We fished exclusively for walleye and based on a map that Mr. Corbett marked up for us. Which meant that we fished primarily the northern and western shores of the lake. When I asked about the northeastern part of the lake and the part of the lake south of the cabin he said, ""Don't know. I've never needed to go there."" 3) Most days consisted of running up to the southern shore of the island which sits almost equidistant from the western and eastern shores just off the north shore (that will make sense if you are looking at a map). That is where Mr. Sternberg sight-fished walleye and we did the same (jig and twister +/- half a crawler). Most walleye there were 17-22"". 4) We would then do a shore lunch on that island and fish our way back to the cabin along the western shore (sometimes trolling, sometimes jigging). We did not fish hard or long hours. 4 of our party were well into their retirement years. There was a lot of puttering around at camp and shore lunch. 5) We caught ridiculous numbers of walleye but never caught any walleye over 24"" until the last evening when we finally fished the area around/behind the cabins. We caught numerous 24-27"" eyes that evening. 6) The other younger guy spent the entire week yelling at me ""Burn The Book"" every time his boat got close enough to mine for me to hear. He still shouts that at me once or twice each time he goes on a trip. 7) If I had it to do over again, I would invest some time in the water south of the cabin and over on the east side of the lake looking for walleye. It was certainly fun to sight fish walleye in shallow water but I think we could have caught good numbers of larger fish if we had spent more time on the water and more time fishing different areas in a more conventional manner. 8) That's probably a lot of typing to tell you very little that will be useful to you, but if you have any questions, let me know."
5087561,bigwalleye89,2016-08-28 15:52:00,1,Hands down the best walleye lake out of Armstrong... good for pike too but not as good as Keezhik. My buddies went the week after we did this year and made this video: Feel free to PM for more information.
