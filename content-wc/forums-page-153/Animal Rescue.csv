(should have taken some pictures....going down into the pit wasn't the most fun time ) Wonder if any others have had similar experiences?

The boys called themselves the Reptile Rangers. Once, we stopped at a spot where another car, a woman and her teenage daughter, had already stopped for a large snapping turtle. None of us were very comfortable with moving the snapper along and the snapper was not being cooperative. We tried urging it along with window scrapers and sticks but it would not budge. I finally just picked it up by the back of the shell and carried it to the swamp on the other side but it tried its best to get me. My older son, probably 8 at the time, said ""That turtle has anger issues"". I thought the women were going to pee themselves laughing."

The goose and gander were very upset and were a short distance away with the rest of the brood. I was the only fisherman in the area so there was no backup. As I got closer to the gosling the adults became aggressive so I picked up a large stick and commenced thrashing the water to hold them at bay. I've bled on other occasions rescuing birds and didn't need a repeat. I grabbed the gosling, maybe three weeks old and managed to untangle him. He would have been a raccoons meal for sure because he wasn't getting loose on his own. We don't need any more geese in our area. They can really mess up a golf outing but as custodian of our dwindling wildlife, I had to react."

6215616,alberta bum,2018-07-01 04:41:00,312,"January or February 2017 had a warm up in northern Alberta.. we were coming back from a job one afternoon and spotted a small black bear cub about 35 pounds wandering around along a bush line.. couple of the guys thought they should rescue it.. one young foolish worker went out and grabbed it and brought it back too the warm pickup.. had it in the pickup for about 3-4 minutes and it went nuts running all over the inside of the truck. Wrapped it up in a sweater and brought it back to the shop in town and called fish and wildlife. officer explained how nuts we were for putting this thing in the truck and how much damage it could do to a person.. he took it and put it in a man made den they have for just such cases.. I've got some pictures and video of it on my phone,, I'll try to figure how to post it"
6215618,fishron,2018-07-01 04:41:00,317,"A few weeks ago, I was checking out a new lake a friend had told me about. To get there, I followed a winding road that paralleled the Unami (turtle in Lenape) creek. It turned out to be a nice pad fringed pond of 13 acres that I will return to. On my way back home, I came upon a large snake crossing the road and no doubt about to be run over. I pulled my car around in front of the snake and put my flashers on. The snake, between five and six feet in length, turned out to be a black rat snake. Last time I had handled one of those big guys, I was spending time with Uncle Sam at camp A.P. Hill in Virginia many years ago. The snake was doing it's best to become part of the road, being of the same color. As I moved in behind it, to get a behind the head grip to move it into the woods, the snake sprung to life and with mouth wide open tried to get me with a reverse over the back maneuver. My wife who was watching in the cars rear view mirror saw the whole episode including the snakes second attempt to intimidate me. After that, I cautiously guided the snake off the road surface and into the woods where I hoped it would take a new path. As I returned to my car a vehicle came along that most likely would have ended the snakes life. I've stopped many times for turtles and smaller snakes but this one was a bit of an adventure."
6215844,Carnhzkr,2018-07-01 13:45:00,964,"I've spent many days fishing below the Caribou Falls dam on the English River north of Kenora. I used to enjoy watching the pelicans there. They seemed to be organized and would work together to herd white fish into a group then one of the pelicans would seem to say, ""Don't mind me, I'm just enjoying the scenery, dum de dum de dum."" then he'd swoop his beak under the water and come up with a huge white fish flopping around in his pouch. Loads of fun to watch. Around 15 years ago, my mom and dad were fishing up there and enjoying the pelican show. My dad noticed one of the huge white birds looked odd with its head down at a strange angle. As he motored closer he could see the bird had evidently mistaken a Rapala for an easy meal and its peak and foot were now caught in the trebles. No self respecting farmer is ever without a quality pair of pliers hanging from his belt, so with pliers in one hand, my dad grabbed the bird around the beak and used his pliers to free the trebles from both the beak and webbed foot. I imagine that type of thing happens more than one might think. Any minnow looking crank bait could easily spell doom for an eagle, pelican or any water bird."
