6214098,wooglin,2018-06-27 08:29:00,371,"Which lodge did you stay at? We're considering Lac Seul for a walleye/musky trip and are targeting the east side - always have fished out of Sioux Lookout, and it's a big daily drive, so would rather stay up in the NE. Thanks!"
6214482,rockape,2018-06-28 07:28:00,215,We stay at Winoga in Sioux Lookout. 10-15 minute drive to the Deception ramp. Ben and Troy are super cool and knowledgeable. Great accommodations too. The only options on the east side of Lac Seul are Lac Seul outposts and Andersons has a few outposts up near Chamberlain narrows.
6214494,milfish,2018-06-28 07:58:00,249,Also Ken and Brenda Robbins Lac Seul Outposts Camp. Been staying there for 20+ years terrific! 1-807-567-4775. Camp is right in Chamberlain Narrows.
6214498,wooglin,2018-06-28 08:15:00,371,So you spent some serious boat-drive time to and from good muskie waters?
6214680,x4flatfish,2018-06-28 16:03:00,319,"Once you put in at the deception landing you are in muskie water. You can catch muskie. We come from the other direction and fish from crooked narrows on up towards Devils Elbow. We stay at River Edge Outfitters on Big Vermillion, just a short 5 minute drive to the landing in Lost Lake by Hudson. From there we are fishing Muskie in 10 minutes. Can fish from Crooked Narrows on up through Manito Rapids, around Bear Paw, Devils Elbow or thru the Rags and the 3 Island stretch. Many places to fish and many huge muskie caught in these waters. Same or less on the water time as going from Deception Landing. Check with Ben Beattie or any of the guides at Moosehorn...They are not running to Chamberlin everyday but are catching a lot of big muskie"
6214956,wooglin,2018-06-29 08:23:00,371,"Right on, appreciate the response!"
6212568,dakota eye,2018-06-23 19:05:00,69,Any new reports?
6212604,btyreprich,2018-06-24 05:14:00,1067,"We fished like 1/2 a day yesterday after staying overnight in International Falls. We caught a mixed bag of fish yesterday - Walleye, Norther, Bass, and two nice size Perch. All were released. Total of at least 24 or so fish. The fish we caught were shallow - under 10 feet of water using jigs and a Shad Rap I was casting. I'm thinking the Bass are spawning which is why we caught as many as we did. No Walleyes in the slot size - but they would have made a nice shore lunch. I did see people in the fish house but am not sure the size of those fish. Wil post later tonight after days fish8ng - if I can grab an internet signal."

6212720,David Anderson,2018-06-24 10:50:00,2073,"Just got back on Wednesday from the Chamberlain Narrows area. With bluebird skies and little wind we struggled to get anything consistent. The fish flies were just starting to hatch in Wapesi and Tuk areas and what walleyes we did catch were full of them. We did have our best luck where there was a little current. Last Sunday was our best day as it was more overcast and we had some wind. My friend stayed until yesterday and said the fish flies were thick on Friday so I suspect the main hatch is done with. We normally go this week but moved it up this year. The walleyes still seemed shallow yet the water temp in Wapesi was 74 degrees. The walleyes we did get were pretty nice however, and of course who would complain about 50 walleyes in the boat/day average? Admittedly that's a far cry from the opener were we had a 135 in the boat average for 3 days so it was all relative. We did get some bass, and a few nice northerns."
6212924,btyreprich,2018-06-24 18:33:00,1067,"Hey Pooch! We fish out of Ear Falls and stay at Evergreen Lodge. New owners Brent and Kathy are great people. After 1 full day of fishing, we had a nice shorelunch today and put a few in the freezer. Other people in camp are doing quite well. Otherwise you just have to work to find them. Normally we fish in mid August and have lots and lots of spots to fish that time of the year. Will update you later in the week. I know you fish out of Makwa Lodge and I myself would like to fish that part of Lac Seul one day when I retire."
6212992,Pooch,2018-06-24 20:05:00,4618,Thanks for the reply and update. We leave in twelve days for Lac Seul Lodge. Looking forward to a break from work and bringing five new to LSL with me. Part of our fall Mahkwa group. Will be back there late August.Have a great trip.Pooch
6213142,rockape,2018-06-25 07:54:00,215,"I fished Lac Seul on the 17th and 18th. Fished muskies exclusively. The attachment says it all. The water is flat out hot right now. 70-75 degrees. We caught a few big walleyes over the slot on musky baits, so they are still hanging around. We were fishing shallow. 3-10 feet of water. LOTS of pike."
6213154,emma17,2018-06-25 08:23:00,436,Wow. Beautiful Musky. Congratulations.
6213200,PRO-V16,2018-06-25 09:23:00,454,I missed this years trip for medical reasons but my buddies were up there from June 10 - 23. Located near Taylor island and fished from Vaughn Lake to near Chamberlain to Deception Bay. Covered a lot of ground. Found fish very shallow and deep. Could get some to bite in most instances but hard to find a spot to put a whupping on them other than Vaughn. Bigger ones were mostly deeper but not always. Seem to be in between transition to mid-lake structure. They could get a hundred a day or so per boat but worked very hard to do it. Mostly jigging with piece of crawler or minnows and some plastics. Throwing shallow with twister tails worked at times. Hot and fairly calm most of the time.
6214010,btyreprich,2018-06-27 05:18:00,1067,Had a pretty good day yesterday Son caught a Northern Pike that weighed over 10 lbs Several Walleye over the slot and as many in the slot. Lots of smaller fish and a shore lunch as well. Two smaller size Bass but sadly no Perch. Previous days we caught fish in less than 12 feet of water. Yesterday we caught the fish at 15 and shallower.
