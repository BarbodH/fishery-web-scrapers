We figured it would be a bit different fishing this year with the late ice out, and we were right - but it was still spectacular. Day 1 started with fishing the usual areas for late June, and finding tons of fish but nearly all of them small. We figured that meant the larger fish were behind schedule, so we fished some areas that were typically earlier season spots, and found...tons of fish, but most of them small. Fun action, but not much of any size to tangle with. We put our thinking caps on, looked at our maps, and charted likely routes between known spawning areas and known summer hangouts, and identified likely stopping points they would use between the two. After that, it was game on. The little bit of thinking and planning paid big dividends, as once we found the walleyes we got into both the numbers and the size we have grown accustomed to on Savant - at one point we had three boats in once little pocket, and six of the seven anglers were hooked up at the same time more than once. As an added bonus, the lake trout bite was really good, especially for larger fish. I caught my personal best laker, and then topped that, and then topped it again. One of them kinda just swam up to the boat and was landed quickly, but the other two (both weighed in the high teens) put up rod-bending, draq-squealing fights that were as good as any fish I've ever battled. Really fun. Best depth for walleyes was 10-12 fow, though we caught some in 2-3' on rocks and some in 20'. Standard 1/4 oz glow-white jig boated 90% of the fish. Pike activity was minimal...weeds growth in the lake was WAY behind with the late ice out, and I think they were just really scattered without any cover to hold them. Some schedule quirks have us making the 2019 trip in mid-July rather than late June, but we will smash em just the same. If anyone is looking for a really affordable fly-in experience, consider Cat Track on Savant or Cliff & Roma's which is just across the bay. Great people, great service, great fishing."
