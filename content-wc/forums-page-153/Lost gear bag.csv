6214646,Greg Pavlov,2018-06-28 14:31:00,121,"I did something very stupid several days (afternoon of Tuesday June 26): I left a brown gear bag with two large boxes of large tube jigs, a large box of flies, portable marine radio, MinnKota remote controller, some tools, several spools of line and a few other items in the middle of the parking lot at the launch ramp at Crystal Beach, Ontario. I would very much like to get it back, especially since several items in it are difficult or impossible to replace and will pay a nice reward for anyone who does so or who leads me back to it. Please PM me if you can help!THank you,Greg PavlovP.S.: I already submitted a report to the local/regional police"
