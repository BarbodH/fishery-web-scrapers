6216148,youngknight,2018-07-02 08:02:00,228,"Thanks for posting but FYI that is an offensive outdated version ( sarcasm). Our prime minister Trudeau, champion of all things politically correct, oversaw the changing of our 135+ year old song from ...all thy sons command to ...all of us command. Don't we all feel better now including our American friends who must have felt conflicted to having to decide between coming to our country to enjoy the wilderness and fishing and being embarrassed and offended at coming to a country with such hateful and sexist lyrics in our anthem. Thank goodness our pm has found time to right such a shameful wrong throwing all sense of tradition to the wind. On a serious note...thanks for recognizing Canada day"
