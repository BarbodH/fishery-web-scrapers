6214822,Obabikon,2018-06-28 20:55:00,2370,"When you have a minor with you, and to take extra fish home, you buy a one day license... Can he be ""gifted"" 2 fish, along with his 2 fish he kept that day... so that he can take 4 walleye home? The one day license offered is a SPORT (not conservation). Seems like a grey area."
6215126,Obabikon,2018-06-29 14:53:00,2370,"If anyone was wondering about this rule... here it is from the MNR office. A person can ""GIFT"" two fish that have already been caught, PLUS as long as the young man is the one to catch the two additional fish on the day of his license, he can take a total of 4 home legally."
6215134,Blue Lk,2018-06-29 15:39:00,269,Just a reminder. No licence is required for residents of Canada for anyone under the age of 18.They are considered as having a Sport licence.
6215196,v-bay gord,2018-06-29 18:29:00,3168,"The answer I received was ""yes"", the four fish would be legal......but be prepared to answer the questions you will get from a CO when checked."
6215220,Shellback,2018-06-29 19:26:00,8083,So does a gifted fish count towards your possession limit?
6215308,Obabikon,2018-06-30 05:46:00,2370,"A gifted fish certainly does count against whomever is the new owner of the fish. Once ""gifted"" it does not count against the giver's ""total"" limit, but if you caught it that day, it does count against your DAILY limit. If that makes sense."
6215436,Shellback,2018-06-30 14:16:00,8083,"Personally I think it should be, you catch it and kill it, it should be counted as in your possession for the length of your trip. A fellow could be catching and giving away a limit everyday, supplying those not having good luck fishing. Seems to me that would be harder on the resource."
6215450,kzoofisher,2018-06-30 15:29:00,5144,"Looking for loopholes/ways around limits is a big part of the reason the rules can get so complicated. There was a very long thread on another forum about what the possession limit was *in your home*. What it boiled down to was guys who could fish the Detroit and Saginaw Bay several times a week trying to figure out if having 80 walleye in the freezer was legal. A Michigan resident fishing the D can go out in the morning and catch his limit on the Michigan side, take it back to his hotel or home and go over to the Ontario side and catch another limit. That's 11 fish a day in a river where the max both governing agencies will allow is 6. Clearly, that isn't the intent of either Resources agency. Or a fisherman can have a great week on the Bay and put 56 fish in his freezer, then take a long weekend to Ohio and bring back another 24. Once the fish are in the freezer who's to say where they came from and when? Any rule that tried to prevent people from doing that though would have to be super complicated and require fishermen to record where and when they caught fish and then be able to provide proof of that. Way too complicated to be workable and enforceable. Not that the DNR biologists like it, they just know there's nothing they can do about it. But, for many people if it can't be prosecuted it's ethical. And that goes for a lot more than fishing."
6215596,Obabikon,2018-06-30 22:04:00,2370,"That's true, but most people catch and eat a limit everyday anyways. From a total population stand point, dead fish are dead fish... not matter what freezer they go to. My question wasn't really meant to debate the rules, but to clarify the rules. If a father/son group decides they want to take 4 more walleye home, can they do that with a 1 day license. Answer: Yes."
6215606,forgop,2018-06-30 23:23:00,880,That would seem logical to me. Saves ya about $30 on the license plus no need to buy the outdoors card. Sent from my Pixel 2 XL using Tapatalk
