They used to always degrade the signal, but haven't done that since the early 2000s. Other factors can reduce the accuracy of your gps substantially, like the availability of WAAS (wide area augmentation service). You can check to see if you are receiving the WAAS signal on your depth finder. I occasionally lose mine on Lake of the Woods and that dramatically reduces accuracy. You can also check the estimated position error to get an idea how accurate the signal is.If they reduced accuracy without good reason they would play havoc with aviation as they now use gps for precision approaches for instrument landings. This requires a great deal of accuracy.Finally, the quality of the survey is probably the most important factor. Lakemaster's map of the Sabaskong area is far better than the 6214 map which had a southward bow in the middle of it.Frank"
6214654,RRK285,2018-06-28 14:47:00,44,"It was my 11th year going to Minnitaki. Our lodge owner said we were 3-4 ft low of average. Fishing was the worst its ever been for that week of June. I have done better during bug hatches. Water temp was 78 usually around 67 for that week, and really no weed growth which I can not understand. The low water has it all thrown off. He also said that the Lakemaster guys were out on the lake in the fall mapping it out while fishing. This chip and mapping is new and just came out in Spring for most of Ontario lakes. Like i said it was way off in lots of spots. 7ft hump but map said should be in 50ft. When i talked to hummingbird they want me to send in any waypoints i have of rocks marked so they can update their graphs. Doesnt sound very accurate process. good thing for insurance !!"
6214658,RRK285,2018-06-28 14:53:00,44,"PapaDave - maps looks close. Yours is missing a main like reef too. The one I am talking about. Its about 7-10ft and your map says its 100ft deep. Everyone knows about it. Walleye and Lake Trout guys fish it every day. I feel like they drive around , dont map everything and then just connect the lines, but obviously miss a great deal"
6214752,papadave,2018-06-28 18:13:00,151,I have been told that if the lake charts on the Lakemaster chip don't say HD they are just copies of Canadian Coast Guard surveys from 30 to 50 years ago. You're 100% correct when you say they just took soundings in a few areas and then connected the lines. What bothers me most is places like this picture on both chips. I have gone by it hundreds of times and no one ever fished it so couldn't wait to get there! All it turned out to be is one big rock sticking out with 35' on all sides around it. Now that I look at it maybe I should have tried fishing the back side on the slope.
6215004,labsrus,2018-06-29 09:54:00,557,"I fish a smaller lake in Ontario. there is a small island that has a shelf that goes 125 yards off one side that is 4 to 10 feet deep, maps shows 35 feet of water, This shows the same on my new Garmin lakevu map looking forward to getting to lake in a couple of week to see how the Garmin map draw program really works"
6213382,RRK285,2018-06-25 14:44:00,44,"Just got back from Minnitaki near Sioux Lookout... without a lower unit. Water levels down 4-6ft. Hit a reef that I have gone over 50 times over the years. I was using my Helix with Lakemaster Ontario Chip , it said i should of been in 30+ ft of water with no other rocks or reefs in sight. This was about the 4th time i noticed during the week that the mapping was way off as I found a 7ft hump on the main lake that was marked on the map as 50+ ft. Had my offset on and low water color set too. I was trying to avoid shallow areas Since the Ontario chip is new , i just want everyone out there to be careful as it is nowhere near accurate. I called Hummingbird, they seemed to care and passed me along to a couple different people to speak to and are going to send the complaint to their mapping dept."
6213390,papadave,2018-06-25 15:05:00,151,We had a similar discussion on the electronic forum. You could help me a lot by comparing your Lakemaster Ontario chart for Minnitaki Lake with the Navionics North America chart linked below. I'm trying to figure out if they both used the same source for their data. It appears that unless the Lakemaster list specifies HD you are just getting the same inaccurate Coast Guard charts that you already have on your Canada Navionics card. https://webapp.navionics.com/#boating@9&key=mgcpHjrzoP
6213422,martinbns,2018-06-25 16:08:00,1520,"I suspect both are using the old maps the Canadian Coast Guard had done 100 years ago of every commercial waterway. Most haven't been updated since. I was bass fishing the other day, going around a point in a light blue area and all of a sudden the trolling motor started chomping on a reef that wasn't on the Navionics map at all. It was about 1 foot under the surface, had to get on the back of the boat with my buddy and let the TM grind along to get off. Nothing other than a few scratches to the TM. Mapping in Canada in general is nothing like you guys are used to, Canadians don't spend the same kind of money on electronics and generally don't travel as much to fish as Americans."
6213424,IaDave14,2018-06-25 16:18:00,99,Besides your issues-I can relate I have replaced 2 units how was the fishing? I have been disappointed the last 2 Sept trips. Sorry to hijack the original post.
6213614,rockape,2018-06-26 06:47:00,215,I also just got back from Minnitaki and Lac Seul. The lower water is easy to see on Lac Seul due to the water lines on rocky shores. Water is 18-24 inches low up there. Minnitaki looked fairly normal to me. No rock collisions for our lower unit although we were zipping along and I saw some big rocks at the last minute maybe a foot down where we didn't have issues before. Total near miss. Be careful!
6213630,jdfire,2018-06-26 07:12:00,16,"We just got back from Minnitaki as well and one of our fishing companions lost a lower unit to the rocks. On a spot showing 10ft on Navionics. Generally the Navionics has been pretty accurate for trips on Minnitaki, even going down to the English river falls."
6213640,CMesserschmidt,2018-06-26 07:23:00,1006,I will be on Lac Seul Starting Friday to Wed I will be mapping for Navionics as much as I can. Looking forward to getting out there again.
6213650,Wrktfsh,2018-06-26 07:40:00,492,It's my understanding that gps signal can be degraded at will by the DOD. Not sure if there's any truth to this
6213676,Coyoteman,2018-06-26 09:17:00,209,"I just got my card yesterday so I pulled up where I go, gullrock, to compare. It matches up to my waypoints a lot better than navionics. I'm very happy with how it looked"
6213748,Pooch,2018-06-26 11:32:00,4618,"Never ever trust the depth or marked hazards on any chip or printed map. They are good at putting land mass and islands in the correct spot, but accurate depth charts are a pipe dream. Go fast at your own risk. Especially on a lake like LS that is in constant flux as far as depth. Plus current and wind seems to move the sands around.Besides land masses the cards (on LS anyway) do get the navigation markers in the right spot, problem is most of the buoys are no longer there. BUT... the rocks and steel base that held them in place are still there so beware.Pooch"
