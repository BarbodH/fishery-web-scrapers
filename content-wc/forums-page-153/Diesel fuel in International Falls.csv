Where else can I fuel up with good diesel fuel before crossing the border? Pulling a boat so some of the popular stops are a traffic disaster most of the time. Then to be able to get to the diesel pump is another problem.Thanks,Pooch"

6215684,fishingfever,2018-07-01 08:11:00,85,We usually get diesel fuel about 20 miles south of the Falls. Can't remember the name of the station but it's at the Ash River Trail turnoff. Large sign on the east side of the road. Very easy in and out. Never been congested.

That place is a zoo and as you said, trying to jockey for position for the one diesel pump might be difficult. Cenex The Fisherman, is the fist station you come to as you get into town. It's on your right. It may not be the cheapest fuel in town, but there's a lot of room to maneuver. Easy in and out. I've got to believe they have diesel because it looks like it's laid out to accommodate semis.Install Gas Buddy on your smart phone. That'll tell you where you can find diesel and who has the best price.Editing to add - someone mentioned the big station at the Ash River Trail turnoff. I pulled into that station on my way home Saturday and pulled back out after finding out they only have super smelly outhouses. That didn't pass the wife requirements. Also, their gas was the most expensive I saw on the entire trip."
6215966,Pooch,2018-07-01 18:25:00,4618,"Holiday is the place I avoid, even without a boat. Cenex is where we usually stop, but last year some pumps were not functioning and no sign was on them. Lack of maintenance? Ended up pulling out and turning around on the other side of the pump then waiting for two others now ahead of me. Others pulled into the broken pump (tank empty?) and we tried to wave them off before they put in their credit card like I did.A large modern well lit station not in town would clean house as far as fuel sales. Think truck stop type of facility. Then again it is pretty seasonal up there.Pooch"
6215990,That Minnesota guy,2018-07-01 19:06:00,8293,"The key thing you said there Pooch was ""seasonal"". With the decline at the paper mills that town pretty much survives on Canadian fishing. Cenex, south of town by the Chocolate Moose does have diesel. The pumps are on the NE side past the car pumps. Jims on the Ash River Trail is for sale if anybody wants to move to the Northland."
6216038,mr.crampster,2018-07-01 20:41:00,18,"The Holiday station is a Chinese fire drill. People in all directions. Boats, trucks, ma an pas. Just stopped there on Saturday. Bad rest rooms. But you know it's next to the liquor store. I like a drink too but people walking away from the pumps to buy booze while parked at the station only a few feet away. That's enough."
6216092,bigwalleye1,2018-07-02 05:40:00,2632,"There's a BP a little north of the McDonalds and Tim Horton's on the opposite side. The diesel is the pump closest to the east/west road and the concrete tips just a little toward the street, so the filler neck on vehicles is on the high side. They also have non-ox premium at the same set of pumps."
