We've been flying out of Wawa for years, and are thinking of going further North for some different water.Mostly chasing eyes and Pike, but if Trout are around we will throw our lines out there too. For our group, the more remote the better. It's our week to get away and the experience is just as important as the fishing."

Melchett is a popular lake for Walleye and Pike.Nakina North Outfitters Percy Lake is on the Little Current River and has Brook Trout, Pike and Walleye. Deep Wilderness Outposts has several interesting options.Namegosikaa Outfitters also has some interesting outposts.Brace Lake Outfitters just picked up Little Makok Lake on the Albany River which is worth checking out, especially if you're into Brookies.Of course, Leuenberger, Seven Lakes and Twin Lakes have been flying out of Nakina for a long time and have numerous outposts to choose from.I don't know who you were flying with out of Wawa, but Outpost Camps has a lot great options that are as good as many of the camps out of Nakina.Not sure which direction you are coming from, but Hearst Air out of Hearst has some good options as well. Napken and Quantz are quite far north.Also, I think Air Cochrane out of Cochrane is worth mentioning for the SW Kesagami Outpost and Partridge Lake Outpost because you can take a 5/10 minute walk and fish Kesagami Lake."
