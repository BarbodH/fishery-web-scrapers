I had been there several times in the past but the past 5 years have been busy with life, so this was our first time back for a while. Nothing has changed! Absolutely beautiful part of the world with incredible fishing and nothing but great service from our lodge and daily guides. They have built two new large cabins that are very clean, comfortable and modern and the daily meals were outstanding. Made to order breakfast at 7 AM, on the water at 8, shore lunch of either fresh fish or sandwiches (your choice) and dinner back at the camp at 6. It did not get dark until 1 AM (or so I was told as I never stayed up to see) so if you want to go out in the evening, you can hire a guide very reasonably to take you out for a few hours. Largest northern of the week - 48"" walleye 31"" lake trout 42"" brook trout 23"". We had several days casting a variety of lures with non stop pike or walleye action. I am not much on trolling and they tend to troll half waves for lakers. This technique works and we did catch big fish but it is just not my style although productive. The brookies were a little elusive in the river but we did have a few masters. The northerns were almost annoying in the sense that in certain bays, if you were casting most anything, you were getting slammed by 30""+ northerns with the occasional upper 30""s topping out at 48"". I would encourage people to check out this lodge. It is a great one week trip and once you get to Winnipeg, they take care of the rest. God's river lodge is the real deal and God willing, we will be back... enjoy this day..."
