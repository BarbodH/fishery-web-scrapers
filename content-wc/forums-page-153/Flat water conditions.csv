I am wondering what do you guys do to help increase your success in these conditions? Do you change baits, presentations, depths? Thanks for any input!"

6215772,kzoofisher,2018-07-01 11:21:00,5144,"I find the feeding fish are constantly on the move so I'll do a milk run of likely spots looking for fish and fishing fast. If it doesn't produce I'll move on quickly but come back to it later and try again. Many spots can produce for an hour, dry up and produce again a few hours later, or do nothing at 9 and be banging at 2. I'm trying to intersect roving schools and that's mostly luck. Except at high noon every structure has one side that is getting less sun and that's often the best side to try. Usually when the fish are cruising they're in a very narrow depth range and that can funnel them in some spots where the preferred depth gets pinched going into a flat, passing through a reef or along a shoreline. One that I know of is a 20'+- shelf with very deep water on one side and a sharp rise on the other. For 1/2 mile it is 100' wide or more but in one little spot it narrows up to about 30' and any school passing along that shoreline has to all jumble together there like passengers getting on a train. Those are places where I can just park and wait for a school to move through. Very up and down action doing that but it allows for vertical jigging and having a sandwich. One more option is to pick apart weed beds and try for a mixed bag of walleye and smallmouth. If I struggle finding active fish at all I'll look for a flat in the depth range they've been preferring and see if I can tease some up with finesse presentations or ripping reaction baits. Finesse when I'm hardly marking fish and reaction if I can mark them well and know they're off the bottom a little. These are not Canada specific strategies."

Otherwise, except in low light conditions, I tend to go deeper & more aggressive by speeding up, using lipless baits, jigs & plastics fished aggressively, etc. Like the previous poster said, pluck as many as you can & move on to the next spot."
