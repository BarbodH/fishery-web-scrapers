You hear the water splash and just watch the surface. The big ones are not alone."

We flew out of Nestor Falls, and there were a few mayflies on the screen doors of the motel we stayed at before flying in. 190 miles north of there, during June 15-20, we never saw a single mayfly. Very few bugs of any kind, actually. Hope you have a great trip!"

6216230,Guest,2018-07-02 10:35:00,0,"Just returned from Eagle Lake last night. Mayfly hatch going strong and fishing was excellent. Any Bay that had weeds and mayfly hatch you could catch all you want on jig and minnow. From small to over slot. Fished weed edge toward deeper water, they were stacked up. Big walleyes were on humps. 26"" to 29"". Jig and minnow. Fished the Eastern part of Eagle. Had lots of bad storms roll through last week but fishing was excellent. Talked with a couple of guides that said Osborn Bay was unbelievable. You could catch all the shorelunch fish you wanted in 6' of water. We didn't need to go that far. Stayed around Temple Bay. Big Muskies were seen chasing walleyes out of water. No bugs. Sat out on deck of cabin each night enjoyed an adult beverage and had no mosquitoes."
