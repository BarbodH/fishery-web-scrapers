6214240,youngknight,2018-06-27 12:50:00,228,"Just to be clear - this is provincial not federal. Licensee fees are charged by the provincial govt... for most people on this Board this means Ontario. years ago residents did not have to pay for a license to fish. The Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters and similar sportsmen conservation groups supported fees IF it went into fish and game management including enforcement. The implication was that the current (at the time) level of provincial funding would be augmented by this extra revenue making better fish stocking, stream improvements and enforcement. It wasn't long before the govt simply replaced general revenues with licensing fees (not enough to totally but no real net increase in fisheries funding).As for fines. Frankly, the fine amounts are pretty insignificant to the government budget. It's not like a cop setting up a radar and having a quota to get x number of speeders on a shift like sometimes happens - unofficially of course because that would otherwise be wrong!! The fines are really simply meant as a deterrent.I think the ""what did you have for dinner"" question is silly. However, I also think folks that justify that extra fish or two because they spent some money in Canada is also silly. Follow the rules - it isn't that hard. On a fly in lodge with 8 or so cottages one year with my son there was a large group from Ohio that had already filled the freezer with walleye and for the last day they concentrated on taking as many pike home with them as possible. In the fish cleaning shed I saw guys cleaning ones that were more bone than meat and the biggest they could catch and keep...all to maximize their take home. As a resident of Ontario I was not thrilled to see that...but...they were following our laws so to each their own I guess and they came from a part of the state where the only lakes in their area had only bluegills and some crappie."
6214426,btyreprich,2018-06-28 05:11:00,1067,"Yesterday while cleaning fish here in Ear Falls, I was surprised by two conservation officers. Both guys were very polite and even joking that I only had one fish to clean. I told them that the other fish we caught that day were either too small or in the slot. They then asked about the rest of our fish so I asked that they follow me over to our cabin to count the other fillets. During the count process they commented that our approach of one fish per ziploc bag and freezing the fillets flat helped their count process. Where is the plus size fish one officer asked - fish in excess of 21 inches. I replied the camp policy is no fish over 18 so we don't have such a fillet. I then remembered this topic on the site and mentioned to the officers that we had hamburgers and hot dogs for lunch which was the truth. They thanked us for our cooperation and were on their way."
6214960,burgersb,2018-06-29 08:27:00,19,"Let me get this straight.If I go to Canada for 10 days and catch 2 walleyesa day.and I can only bring home 4,can I eat the other 16 ? Or does that mean I can only have 4 walleyes total for the 10 days [what I eat there and what I bring home] ?"
6214962,Shellback,2018-06-29 08:37:00,8083,"Your daily limit is your possession limit. I always buy a conservation license with a 2 fish walleye limit. If I catch and keep 2 walleye, I can't keep anymore until I've eaten the ones I've got in the fridge or freezer. You can't keep a fish for dinner if you already have your limit in the fridge. You can catch and keep your daily limit each day, as long as you have consumed your previous days limit."
6215036,Walleye2242,2018-06-29 11:11:00,263,"we are a small group. When i want walleye to eat for lunch or dinner i keep 1 walleye and eat it. 1 walleye is plenty for me for a meal. I catch 1, eat 1. Catch and release for me. i never bring fish home. eat them there."
6215096,gonefishing13,2018-06-29 14:11:00,46,"Last night is always a late night meal for us.. because we try and stay out on the water as long as we can before coming in and finish cleaning out the cabin and boats. So usually we bring up 3 pizzas for the group and just warm them up while we're working. However, for lunch that day always a huge fish fry. That way we know exactly how many fish we need to keep to take our limit home."
6213874,Golden Eagle,2018-06-26 16:04:00,2642,Consider a meal of pike or perch for your last night in camp.
6214046,Guest,2018-06-27 06:47:00,0,We fly in and always eat a tenderloin with baked potatoes the last night in camp. This also gives our take home fish ample time to freeze for the trip home. We all purchase a conservation license and bring out our walleye limits and usually a few pike. We have been asked this question as well as what we are bringing back (US border). I have seen check points in Canada where they are checking people but we always seem to be headed to base camp and I have not been checked coming out by Canadian Ministry.
6214052,Obabikon,2018-06-27 06:56:00,2370,"We get the ""what did you eat for lunch"" when we have a cooler of walleye in the afternoon. Personally, I think that's taking the rules a bit too far. The idea is to catch poachers, right? However, I think we're at a point where most fishermen don't break the rules as often as they used to. So, officers are still needing to write tickets to fund the MNR program. Maybe I'm off base, but I would guess officers issue fewer tickets now than they did 20 years ago. That money makes a difference."
6214056,PRO-V16,2018-06-27 07:00:00,454,I believe all license fees and the like go straight to the Canadian Federal government general fund and they have to fight for money to fund game and fish activities. It's not like here in the states.
6214062,v-bay gord,2018-06-27 07:15:00,3168,"I guess my question would be ""Why would I necessarily be over my limit"". Does nobody fish after dinner? I can see the lunch question because there you are with more fish in your cooler. In any case if the question makes people follow the letter of the law more closely then I don't have a problem with it."
6214080,kona77,2018-06-27 07:42:00,236,"The last two outfitters we have used have ""take no fish home policies"" in place so this is never an issue for our group.. We stopped bringing fish back over 20 years ago.. We love fish as much as anyone but we have a lot of good opportunities in our home state (Wisc) to keep fish and enjoy meals. It does seem like a shady way for the MNR to catch some honest fishermen on their way home. I have no sympathy for the guys who actually over harvest and are caught on their way home.. MNR should enforce their harvest rules but as someone else stated, this goes well beyond catching the obvious poachers who intentionally abuse the resources"
6214106,v-bay gord,2018-06-27 08:38:00,3168,"Here's a scenario. A group of six have their limit on the last day but also decide to eat a walleye dinner as well. Eight - ten walleye over the limit? If they did that on the last day, how many times were they over during the week? Are they not intentionally abusing the resource? People who abuse the laws are shady.....why can't the MNR be similarly ""shady"" to catch these people.?"
6214146,Obabikon,2018-06-27 09:18:00,2370,"This, to me gets back to why the limit makes no sense. I'm allowed 2 fish per day, 4 total... that encourages me to eat a 22"" fish every day (instead of a couple 14"" fish). In four days, I can have my limit, and eat fish every day.... I just need to eat bigger ones."
6214168,kona77,2018-06-27 09:52:00,236,"V-Gord- While I understand your point of view I still differ on this specific approach/question by the MNR.. I saw Obabikon's comments about the limit structure and eating larger fish and that is also a valid comment. I still cringe when a see pictures of larger walleye's on stringers and wonder why folks still keep larger fish when so many 14""-18"" fish are usually available. As I stated earlier we do not bring any fish back and our outfitter (like many others) asks their quests to throw back any walleye's over 18"".. I might be naïve but I believe most folks follow the rules and guide lines of their outfitters on the number and size of fish that can be kept or consumed while in Canada. We all want the groups that keep dozens (even hundreds) of extra fish caught and punished. I would put folks who make an honest mistake or have a last meal of fish as a separate category.. It is similar to driving 5mph over the speed limit versus 25mph over (best analogy I could come up with). Both are beyond the rules and you can make the case that both should get a ticket..Just my point of view. Understand if you disagree.."
6214178,v-bay gord,2018-06-27 10:12:00,3168,"I think you need to separate the two... .an honest mistake and those that eat fish over and above their limit, with the knowledge that it's illegal but likely they won't get caught. Whether it's a last meal or some other bending of the rules, it's a slippery slope to let people think it will be allowed. CO's have some discretion in whether to charge you or not. Let's hope they treat an honest mistake with a bit more leniency. I also agree with Obabikon on the limits in FMZ5. Unfortunately, this was extended throughout the region because of the support of certain operators in the south who wanted to see "" a level playing field"".....not because it makes sense. Politics."
6213718,billy weaver,2018-06-26 10:53:00,470,"I have been fishing Canada for many years and have been checked at fish checks coming home many times. I believe in limits and abide by the regulations. The one thing I wonder about is one of the officers standard questions. ""What did you have for supper last night"". Of course with a early morning check with a limit of frozen fish it would mean you were over the limit if you had fish for supper the night before. My question is, ""what would you be charged with, one fish over or what"". We never have fish the day before coming home so we are legal."
6213726,bigwalleye1,2018-06-26 10:57:00,2632,I always do bacon wrapped prime fillets and jumbo shrimp on the grill for our last meal in Canada. No point in even going there with the wardens if I can help it.
6213800,Shellback,2018-06-26 13:26:00,8083,"I think that question is a bit out of line. What business is it of them, what you had for dinner last night? Kind of a trick question. What if you had walleye from another guest? The day a conservation officer asks me a question like that, is the last day I would fish in that state or province. I just spent 2 weeks in Canada with my wife, with a conservation license we could bring home 4 fish. I brought home one. I'm all for C/O doing their job and protecting the resources, but when they get chicken s**t with questions like that, I'm done, and that includes any US state officer."
6213802,valley366,2018-06-26 13:31:00,193,We always leave room in the limits for our fish we plan to eat and then catch our last of the freezer fish after the last fish fry.Some years it gets frustrating in both directions. One year we got into a pile of 17 inch early in the week and started filling the freezer up to the amount of fish we planned on eating. Then we played catch and release all week. Sometimes finding those final 17 inch fish is easy. Sometimes you hit a weather front and getting those final fish becomes work.
6213810,WallyWarrior,2018-06-26 13:46:00,2488,"Happened to us this year. We played catch and release all week with exception of a few eaters. Last day it rained and fishing was poor. We came home well short, but that said, I can catch fish to eat down here. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
6213822,DaBirdman,2018-06-26 14:11:00,164,"Depending on when you leave to go home, it's also possible that a person could get some early morning fishing in before departing. So filling out a limit(s) could be possible I guess. Thus, what you have for dinner the night before would be irrelevant. On our week long trips, we have fish meals on Monday and Wednesday. Our last night's meal is leftovers...steak, burgers, brats, chops...whatever we have left from grilling, or we'll finish off eggs, bacon, sausage...breakfast stuff."
6213840,billy weaver,2018-06-26 14:44:00,470,"I have been asked that question three different years, the last time last week at a fish check on HY#11 just east of Ft. Francis. Maybe I had crumbs on my face."
6213842,PRO-V16,2018-06-26 14:47:00,454,We have been asked that a time or two. Have also been asked near the resort when they checked our fish if we had a fry on the lake and how many we ate. They were polite. Checked to make sure we weren't over our limit at any time. Was no trouble and didn't bother us a bit but we did have to do the math since a couple guys were sick of fish and ate Polish for lunch. It would not deter me at all from going since we are always legal. It also helps send a message through the camp so any fish hogs aren't stocking up.
6213846,billy weaver,2018-06-26 14:49:00,470,Thinking about it I suppose they wouldn't ask if you didn't have a limit. After three times it is a planned question used to trap you. I wonder the response if I had said fish?
6213850,Ricky Spanish,2018-06-26 14:56:00,1298,"My guess is the response would be what kind and who caught them? At that point, it should be apparent what the ""right"" answer is."
