6215250,youngknight,2018-06-29 21:01:00,228,Try to get in touch with Mike Borger over on canadafishingguide.net. He used to post some but he may have some knowledge of such opportunities. He helped me out on a trip I never thought I could afford for my son and I and is a wealth of knowledge. He is often on this site as well.

Check Hidden Bay Lodge website they offer monthly specials, tell Shaggy I said hi.Cedar Point Resort offers some late season rates too! Caught a nice 46 inch musky last September jigging for walleye!"
