I am humbly looking for fishing guidance or wisdom from those who might be familiar with this body of water during the Mid-Summer time frame. Our small group (Dad, brother, brother-in-law and young nephew) has never been to Abamasagi and two of the group have never been to Canada...2nd timers for the rest of us. We are staying mid-lake (Cabin #2). I truly appreciate any help. Probably putting to much self-imposed pressure on myself. The group is inexperienced (I am providing all the tackle for the entire group for the trip...if that says anything). Grateful for any general or specific advice. Particularly interested also in places to hide/fish when the wind picks up. Will promise to post report with pictures. Two of the group have never seen a walleye before. Thank you again, Andre"

It is a large body that can get rough but the north east arm provides good shelter and fishing plus the inflow and out flowing kawashagama river. Check out Mike Borgers canadafishingguide.net, he has an older write up on abamasagi."
