6216176,BrianinVA,2018-07-02 08:49:00,160,Just a heads up that Hwy 11 heading east toward the Noden Causeway is down to a single lane with an alternating light near La Place Rendezvous. We encountered longer than usual delays passing through the area the past 2 Fridays as only 20-30 vehicles get through per cycle. Don't let Google Maps try to convince you to take a shortcut using one of the numbered streets as they are blocked off as well. You might want to check if 71 is a quicker option from Fort Frances to your destination. Border crossing was a breeze and no other issues on 502 and 105 through Ear Falls.
