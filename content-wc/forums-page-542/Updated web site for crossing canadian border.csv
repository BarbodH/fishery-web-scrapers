1194261,Ralfeee,2010-04-28 10:47:00,33,"Technically you don't need a passport to enter into Canada, but one is required to re-enter the US, so the website you are looking at might be up to date. When we crossed into Canada last year at Fort Francis they wanted passports, for ID's, and one of our party had it packed away. The guard insisted he dig it out as she wanted to see what he was going to use to re-enter the US."
1194308,Desrosiers,2010-04-28 11:58:00,19,"Bring as passport everytime you cross, no matter what! Not needed going into Canada, by going into the US, it's required"
