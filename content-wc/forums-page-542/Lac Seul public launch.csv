1194513,Guest,2010-04-28 20:23:00,0,"Thanks for the link. Yep, you are correct as we didn't get sooo many fish as it was just a neat experience with some golden walleyes. I am sure the fishing can be exceptional too. I was only about 13 the first time back there which I believe was in 1985 or 1986. I remember one of the guys in our boat had to get out and ""guide"" the boat to stay off the rocks."
1195322,Guest,2010-04-30 18:43:00,0,Did you go with Helen and Carl? I was there all summer in '85.
1195378,Guest,2010-04-30 21:56:00,0,"Yep, I went up there with Carl and Helen."
1195445,Guest,2010-05-01 08:23:00,0,"The camp owner where we go E-mailed me 4-28-2010, to tell me the water level is extremely low with only 6inches of water by the dock(usually 5-6 feet). We usually arrive for the opener, but will delay trip this year unless things change. Been going to sunlite for the past 40 years. Last year in the fall we made the trip up altimer and found other rock that damaged my lower unit. So be careful!! Its not if you will hit something on Lac Suel its when."
1194096,Guest,2010-04-27 21:03:00,0,"Years ago when I was a youngster and staying at Skyline Lodge, we put our boat in at a public launch on the west side of Lac Seul for a day trip to go to Vaughn. It seems like it was somewhere around Onaway lodge. Anyways, I am going to be on Cedar this year again and was thinking of taking my buddy on a day cruise to Lac Seul for walleye and going up and into Broadcast and Sunlight Lakes for the day. Can anyone point me in the best direction to launch? Is the one I described above seem right? During one trip to Onaway, the year after we stayed at Skyline, I remember portaging into those lakes and fishing, and how neat the trip was. I am more of a musky guy, but my buddy wants to get into some great walleye action, so I thought that this may be the ticket (not that cedar doesn't have good walleye fishing itself). Any help from you folks would be greatly appreciated, and any info on Broadcast, Sunlight, and Lac Seul would help tons. Thanks!"

I wouldn't bother...only at opener on a late year is it ever worth venturing up Altimeter. If you're going to put into Lac Seul, fish Lac Seul...it's arguably one of the best walleye fisheries in the world. NWO Fishing Bum"
1194319,Steve of Madison,2010-04-28 12:13:00,230,"Bum is right, when you can get up into Broad and Sunlight, and it might be tougher this year, anytime after 2-3 weeks after the opener it can be a big waste of time, not to mention tough on props and a lower unit."
1194381,JDP,2010-04-28 14:51:00,1457,What week(s) are you going to Lac Seul?
1194454,Guest,2010-04-28 18:10:00,0,"JDP, I will be up there from 6/30- 7/10. Thanks for the info folks. So no one thinks that Sunlight will be any good this late? I was hoping to get some of those really golden eyes outta there, but thats ok. Does anyone have any area suggestions to fish on Lac Seul then? I think I remember fishing McKenzie Bay way back when.

1194463,JDP,2010-04-28 18:48:00,1457,"You never know the water level could rise enough to comfortably get to Broad and Sunlight even by late June early July. It will take major rainfall though. Keep monitoring this board and the watch the water level on this site: http://www.lwcb.ca/index.html.I understand your desire to make the trip up Altimeter to Broad & Sunlight.It probably is based on the experience and as you mention catching resident walleyes with the darker complexion and not ""maxing out on numbers of fish""."
1194471,winston123,2010-04-28 18:58:00,13,"I can't speak for this year. However, we have done very well on Sunlight and Broad late June. That being said, we have done well in a lot of places."
1194474,Guest,2010-04-28 19:04:00,0,What year did you stay at Skyline?
1194508,Guest,2010-04-28 20:17:00,0,"I was there about 2 or 3 different times. I think the first time was 1985, and then again in 1995."
