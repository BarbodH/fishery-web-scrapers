1186346,camp chef,2010-04-06 08:16:00,915,Having way too much water to fish is a terrible problem. We try to fish 3 or 4 NEW spots each day as well the ones we already have come to love and figure it will be 12 or 15 years before we need to head north of the tressle.http://www.bignorthlodge.com/newpic1.jpg
1186667,Caleb,2010-04-06 20:53:00,36,AaronWhere do you fish most when you go South?
1186744,Aaron-IN,2010-04-07 07:05:00,500,"Honestly, I don't even target walleye anymore up there, sort of fell in love with the smallmouth fishing the past ten years or so, so I'm not sure how relevent my reply will be. Anyway, when I go South of minaki I like fishing Gun lake and the small bays off of the main River channel all the way to Throat Rapids."
1187131,Guest,2010-04-08 00:29:00,0,www.thornebros.com Have fun up there. Great water system.
1195127,ranger22,2010-04-30 09:59:00,124,These maps does anybody know if big sand is on them. I looked but i really could not tell.
1195177,camp chef,2010-04-30 12:09:00,915,"Sand Lake is on 6286,The northern map."
1185655,Beagle_Nut,2010-04-04 11:47:00,52,Going to the Minaki area for the first time at the end of September. Anyone know of a decent lake map you can buy of the river and chain of lakes? Thanks.
1185676,wolverine fan,2010-04-04 13:32:00,71,"yep, www.charts.gc.ca and look for map 6286 whitedog dam to minaki, extremely useful map, good luck its great fishery!"
1185899,Beagle_Nut,2010-04-05 07:50:00,52,"That's the site I was looking for. Looking at their online map outlines, though, it looks like map 6286 cuts off the bottom of Gun Lake and that's exactly where we're staying (Big North Lodge). So, it looks like I'll need to be buying 2 maps, both 6286 and 6287 (the next map down) if I want to include where we'll be taking off from every day.Also does anyone have a favorite site for ordering these maps from for shipping to the US (St. Louis area), since the Canadian Fisheries site doesn't sell direct? Thanks."
1185914,camp chef,2010-04-05 08:25:00,915,6287 is the map you want. Once you get it I will be happy to chat on the phone with you . We stay at big north and love it. When are you going?
1185931,Beagle_Nut,2010-04-05 08:57:00,52,"Glad to hear from someone who knows the area. We're going the last 2 weeks of September. It looks like 6287 doesn't go any further north than Minaki, but includes alot of the water south of it. Does that mean you do most of your fishing in Gun itself? What we actually target is northerns (or muskies if they're agreeable) and I've picked up from other posts that Big Sand and the main river channel might be where we need to head for the big guys, so that's why I was thinking we'd need both maps. We do have a decent boat so we can do some travelling if need be, but if we don't need to that'd be fine with us, less gas and time to burn moving instead of fishing."
1185933,jignminow,2010-04-05 08:58:00,168,"Also, the great lakes chip for Lowrance has the entire Minaki area mapped. Not sure if you are bringing a boat or renting."
1185947,Beagle_Nut,2010-04-05 09:24:00,52,"We've got navionics built in to our Humminbird so hopefully the area will be there too (it better be, I've grown pretty dependent on that thing). It's still nice to have a paper map for mulling over in the cabin and planning our ""next attack"" though so we'll be ordering one anyway. Thanks."
1185997,camp chef,2010-04-05 11:41:00,915,"We've never been north of Minaki...Just too much good Water south. I am sure there are people that only fish north of Minaki as well. LOts and lots and lots of water. We keep threatening to get the other map and head north but we haven't begun to explore all the water to the south yet. There also seems to be less people south,which we like."
1186299,Aaron-IN,2010-04-06 06:27:00,500,"I would also stay South of Minaki, no fish North of there Been going there for 30 years, PM me if you have any questions."
1186323,Tony Shirley,2010-04-06 07:52:00,211,No fish north of minaki now thats the funniest think ive heard
