For the guys coming up make sure you are very cautious. Some of the areas I could get to in August I can't get to now. The spring water levels now are lower than the summer August levels. The lake we are on is 4 ½ feet down compared to a normal spring. We have about 14 ft of new shoreline this spring in front of the cabins. As far as docks go our docks are movable/floating so we can move them farther out so the guys don't have to beach there nice boats. An idea for you would be to call your camp and ask what the water levels are and how the docking is before you go. The current water temp is 53 degrees. The past 2 days have been over 70 degrees and we have had a little rain at night.(1/4 inch) All this dry weather makes really dusty roads. The extended forecast looks like 50 to 60 degrees and a chance of rain. The bug report is the mosquitoes are out and the black flies are out too. My eye is swelled up from a black fly bite. Thermacells work great on those days when the bugs seem never ending.Later this week I will try to tell you about my trip to the waterfalls to do some pike fishing.We saw some fry swimming around our docks were about ¾ of an inch long. Does anyone know what they are? My guess is pike but I'm not sure. The walleye fry will be coming soon and in large numbers.

I suppose a home schooled young'n in the bush can get in a day of learning by 8 a.m. ...........then on to more interesting activities.Don't do anything to make Mom yell at you.

I am making sure she doesn't yell because her yelling is a .Im looking foward to a get the reports up and going and our camp is almost fully booked so that means lots of guiding trips. I'm thankful my parents got me involved in this job because if they haden't I would have missed out on a life.
