1194932,nitroman,2010-04-29 20:32:00,368,Has anyone tried it up north and if so how did it work out for you? I bought some Mustad Slow Death hooks and am eager to give it a try. Actually I'm just eager to be up there fishing lol! 21 days to go!
1194938,Glenman12,2010-04-29 20:41:00,762,To be honest Nitroman I never tried it...looks interesting...www.mustad.no/slowdeath/ good luck on the opener...42 days for me..
1194951,joeman79,2010-04-29 21:05:00,417,I tried them last year at Lac Seul and had some sucess. I had a little trouble getting worm the right length. But we did not drift or troll much at all. Good idea and it works and I hope we drift more so I can try it again this year. There are some YouTube videos on it I think.
1194996,Peffley'sCamp,2010-04-30 04:27:00,37,"I fished them last year on Wabaskang too and had success. I didn't have a chance to fish them until July but they definitely caught fish. Continued to fish them through August with good success too.Two keys for me were to make sure the worm was hooked DEAD center, and the slower I fished it the better it worked. Must be why they call it slow death...."

1195017,Peffley'sCamp,2010-04-30 05:08:00,37,"I used Sampo coastlock swivels that were left over from my days of chasing salmon and trout on Lake Michigan. Probably the most expensive swivel on the market, but they always performed well on the big water for me and worked well with a slow death rig too."
1195018,MN_Moose,2010-04-30 05:11:00,965,I used slow death hooks on LOTW last year. Pretty good results. Mostly drifted them across spots. Only trouble I have is threading the dang crawler on.
1195058,fishman10,2010-04-30 07:36:00,226,"i believe that theses hooks not only catch fish, but they also catch the fisherman. we have used these extensively in canadian waters and have seen no difference in outproducing spinner rigs."
