True ""Blue Pike"" do not have the white tips and do have noticeably larger eyes. Also, ""Blue Pike"" maxed out in size at 20"".More Here:http://bluewalleyes.wikidot.com/what-is-a-blue-pike"

1194127,Guest,2010-04-28 04:04:00,0,"My fishing group usually manages to catch a few blue morph walleye when fishing in the Cabonga reservoir in lavendre park. They seem to mix freely with similar size yellow walleye. As a boy, I can remember seeing lake Erie blue pike, along with many other fish on ice, at the local food store where I grew up in Northeast Philly. The blue coloration was not as remarkable as was the size of the eyes in comparison to regular walleye. Infrequently in the Cabonga, we will catch walleye that are markedly darker than the usual yellow walleye and on occasion fish that are decidedly red around the fins and lacking any of the yellow walleyes coloration. I'm pretty sure these redish fish are sauger and I've never seen one much over three pounds. The next time I catch one I will do a dorsal spine count. One thing they all seem to have in common is they are all great to eat, preferably on site, while having a shore lunch.........good fishing this year!!!!"
1149547,twobearlake,2009-11-22 15:27:00,379,"Gilligan,It might be worth your time to shoot that picture to the DNR to see what they think about the blue walleye you caught. I think that if I recall correctly what I've read about the blue pike, the issue is that all of the ""pure"" genetic blue pike were gone and what are left in Erie are walleye with some of the genetics of the blue pike, but not real blue pike. However, we have thought other species were gone only to find them at a later time. It would be pretty cool if the fish you have caught on Erie were blue pike. I don't recall how the pike were different from the walleye, but the DNR should be able to confirm the species.TB"
1149668,Mike Kansas,2009-11-23 08:33:00,1463,"Frank, Great to hear from you. Wish you would slip up to LIL next year and help me pick on Basil. I think my wife caught one of the Silver Pike. It was about 16"" and looked like a Pike except it was silver with a few black dots. I told her it was a Canadian Tarpon...she said ""Oh, how neat"" Best Regards, Mike Kansas"
1149767,joeman79,2009-11-23 17:44:00,417,"Mike, No I never caught one at Lac Seul this past summer. But one guy in our group caught one. In 248 days I will try once again. Been busy here with Hunters and have not spent much time on WC. Joe"
1149862,Mike Kansas,2009-11-24 07:35:00,1463,"Does that mean you are going back to Lost Island in 2010? I hope so because that means it met your expectations. As you well know we love Lost Island Lodge because of it's atmosphere and the great fishing we have experienced there. Best Regards, Mike Kansas"
1150117,joeman79,2009-11-25 00:06:00,417,Yes we are going back to Lost Island Lodge! I loved the place and the staff. Hopefully this year the weather and fishing will be better. The weather this past year was definetely way below average temps/ and the fish were not in thier normal places. I am excited for 2010. Joe
1150453,nitrox,2009-11-26 17:30:00,21,"I have caught blue walleyes up in the Nakina area. Abamasagi, O'Sullivan and the Koppakatunga river system. I am also a scuba diver and the head dive master at my shop have photographed them while diving in Grand Traverse Bay in Lake Michigan."
1151248,Mike Kansas,2009-12-01 12:12:00,1463,Glad to hear that you are going back to Lost Island in 2010. The weather was a problem all year. We happened to hit it in July when it was good and the fishing was great. Have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. Mike Kansas
1169573,Guest,2010-02-16 16:32:00,0,"I agree with the small lakes comment. The Cabin we go to every year has them. You have to take a boat up to another lake, then a canoe for about an hour and you are in the right spot. The owner of the camp told us about this fish and we had to make a day of it. Glad we did cause it made for some great pictures to show friends state side. The Camp was Hidden Lake:www.cobham-river-lodge.com"
1169594,bob oh,2010-02-16 17:35:00,3936,"Giligan, here is some info on the blue pike of Lake Erie, really a subspecies of the walleye. Material is from Ohio SeaGrant site. A lot of info there. """"The renowned blue pike (Sander vitreus glaucus) was declared extinct in 1970 and to date, no verified specimens have been brought forward. Yet anglers continue to report blue-colored walleye, particularly in Canada. Now two University of Wisconsin researchers have shown that a strain of blue-pigmented walleye does exist, but they are actually the common yellow walleye, not the extinct blue pike. W.F. Schaefer and M.H. Schmitz of UW's Dept. of Biology have identified a blue pigment, sandercyanin, which is found in certain walleye in Canada, usually from above 45 degrees north latitude (Lake Erie is roughly 41 degrees north). And occurrences of blue pigmentation in walleye appear to be spreading south. The researchers describe these blue walleye as being an albino form which lack the yellow pigment characteristic of normal yellow walleye. The blue pigment is not found in the skin but instead is part of the fish's mucous. These walleye have transparent fins and the blue-tinted mucous is usually restricted to the dorsal (upper) half of the body. Seasonal variation was seen in the production of sandercyanin - the fish appeared most blue in late summer. While the function of this blue coloration is not known, Schaefer and Schmitz are looking into its role in photoprotection -- protecting these otherwise unpigmented fish from intense summer sunlight. They also find that many normally-colored yellow walleye also carry sandercyanin in their mucous, but in lesser amounts. So how can we be sure these aren't actually the legendary blue pike? The structure of the skull was different. Blue pike had larger eyes that were closer together than in yellow walleye. When the diameter of the eye socket was measured and compared to the distance between the eye sockets, the ratio was 1:1.4-2.0 for blue pike but 1:0.8-1.2 in walleye. That may be a rather technical way to separate them but it's a reliable characteristic that won't change. While the research reported only on walleye, this phenomenon could be similar for the occasional blue-tinted yellow perch that is reported."""""
1188209,Guest,2010-04-10 19:43:00,0,"Hey Mike Kansas My wife and I fish with a guide out of lost island but we haven't been in over five years. We had one of those ""blue walleye"" experiences like you described. Bet we caught 4-50 in one hole. they were in about 25 ft. Is the fishing still good? Too bad about our jayhawks."
1148337,johnboat,2009-11-16 13:08:00,2014,Exactly what is a blue walleye. I have heard people talk about them but have never seen or caught one. A fly in buddy of mine says that some of the smaller lakes way up north have them and that they are not in all of them. What goes into the making of these and why do some lakes have them and some do not. Just wondering.............. Keep'er On The Bottom!! John B.O.A.T.
1148353,Mike Kansas,2009-11-16 14:40:00,1463,"Last July we got into the Blue Walleye for two days on Lac Seul. We got into large schools of them both days and were catching them one after another with them being between 17"" and 24"" and one that was 28"". It was the first time in my 59 years of Walleye fishing that I ever saw a Blue Walleye.We fished the same area for two more days and caught plenty of Eyes but no more Blues. Their backs and heads had a Blue tint to them and when you looked at their fins they looked like blue celophane. I wouldn't say that they are prettier than a normal Walleye but they sure are different looking. None of our group had ever caught any Blue Walleye before but in those two days I would estimate that we boated 300+ of them. Mike Kansas"
1148407,twobearlake,2009-11-16 18:52:00,379,"There was a Blue Pike that was a relative of today's walleye that was commercially fished in Lake Erie. These ""true"" blue walleyes (because they had blue pigment in their skin) are thought to have been fished to extinction. The ""blue"" walleyes that are caught up north have a blue tint to their slime coat, but do not have true blue pigment in their skin. There was a really interesting article about the Blue Pike in the Minnesota Conservation magazine sometime in 2008. There is supposedly a lake somewhere in northern MN where some DNR workers brought some of the last true blue pike before they were fished out of Lake Erie. It's not clear if that is just lore or fact, but it makes for an intriguing story.Here is a wiki link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_walleyeI found the link for the article I was talking about. Interesting story. Enjoy.http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/volunteer...blue_pike.htmlTB"
1148420,saulteyes,2009-11-16 19:56:00,32,Blue walleye acctually come from an algea that grows on the skin. If you catch one in the winter it will acctauly turn the snow blue as the algea comes off the skin. That was published in an article in the Ontario Out of Doors magazine. I would have to look up which article.
1148539,Steve Ediger,2009-11-17 11:10:00,97,"I too, have caught ""blue"" walleye in Lac Seul, but I have also caught them in Kansas. I don't think I have seen any prettier walleye than some of the yellow and orange walleye that you can catch in Sunlight and Broad lake. They are beautiful.Steve"
1148563,Mike Kansas,2009-11-17 12:48:00,1463,"It appears after reading the articles that were posted that the ""Blue Walleye"" is extinct. I don't know what to call the ones we caught on Lac Seul but they sure looked Blue. Especially when you looked at the fin webbing. True Blue or not they were neat and fun to catch. Best Regards, Mike Kansas"
1148677,joeman79,2009-11-18 00:15:00,417,We went to Richardson Lake on a Fly-In with NWO. And we caught tons of Blue Walleyes. There was a definite difference. They were BEAUTIFUL!!!! Look in my pic album and you will see. July 31st to Lost Island Lodge!! Can't wait!!!!!!
1148928,Mike Kansas,2009-11-19 07:16:00,1463,"Nice pictures Joeman. Did you catch any Blues at Lost Island last year? We caught all of ours there with Basil. Best Regards, Mike Kansas"
1149497,orchard frank,2009-11-22 08:28:00,1900,"We got into the blues one year at Albert's Bay. Not the numbers you mention, but a lot of them. Another odd fish I caught was what I have heard called a silver pike. Almost chrome colored, with yellowish dots, very unusual looking, definitely a pike, not a small musky. Not very big, 20"" or so. Grassy Lake. Jim was still there then, he said he had seen a few before, but not many, and all were small."
