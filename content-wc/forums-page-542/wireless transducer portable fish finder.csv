1194782,phishfearme,2010-04-29 13:43:00,1242,"bassface - thanks for the reply. actually, we use an eagle portable and are quite happy with it's performance - but it ""only"" has 160 verticle pixel resolution and as i've mentioned, the transducer cable has been abit of a nuisance as it seems to get in the way at the most inopportune times and one time it was stepped on and had to be respliced. i just thought that if i can get a new sounder for around $150 or so with 240 verticle pixels and no tranducer cable i thought i'd try one out. many reports i've heard though talk about short battery life - our eagle will last for an entire 10 day ""week"" on 8 - D-cells. using the AA batteries just can't last that long but i could always bring backups - we're always trying to keep weight down for fly-ins. thanks, phish"

1195162,bassface44,2010-04-30 11:16:00,96,that is a lot of battery life for that unit. we typically go through two sets of 6v lantern batteries on the 535 units over a week if we are good about not using it when it isn't necessary. I personally like having it on all the time so I go through three sets some years. You can still find the 565 portable for around 250 and we use 2 fully charged gel cells in a week for that unit. I know weight is a huge issue on the fly-ins but having that extra resolution can be huge up there too in my opinion. I hope you find something that works out for you.
1192813,phishfearme,2010-04-24 15:03:00,1242,"i'm considering getting a HUMMINBIRD SMARTCAST RF15 fish finder that has a wireless transducer. anybody have any experience with this? especially battery lifetime in both the main unit and the transducer. i heard that it's only a few hours - yuck - and there's no details on the web site. also, there was no detail as to how the transducer connects to the boat - suction cup? thanks, phish"

It might work out through fiberglass... Maybe I was doing something wrong but I was pretty bummed when it didn't work out."
1192872,phishfearme,2010-04-24 18:18:00,1242,"glenman - thanks, looks like i'd have to buy a special suction cup kit. i'm still skeptical - i know this was designed for shore fishermen to cast out the transducer and check out bottom conditions out from shore - i just seems like a good idea for in the boat too - to avoid the cable getting in the way. i'm still curious about the battery life - there's one guy trying to sell a small 12 VDC car battery claiming that the battery life is only a few hours. phish"
1192906,Glenman12,2010-04-24 20:21:00,762,we use an Eagle Fish Easy 320 with a suction cup mount..comes with a strap you can tie somewhere on the boat so it wont go flying to far should it come off..in 5 years of using it the suction cup has only come off once ..
1192969,phishfearme,2010-04-25 04:51:00,1242,"yah, we tie off the transducer to the boat someplace (learned the hard way when the transducer came off at full speed and yanked the whole sounder into the lake after smacking the driver in the shoulder) but if there was a way to eliminate the cable from the sounder to the transducer it's something i'd like to look into. thanks, phish"
1193256,brwhite,2010-04-25 18:01:00,41,"I bought one of these:http://vexilar.com/pages/accessories...ackets_hs.htmlThen I bought a bracket at homedepot and shaped it to fit the smartcast transducer and lashed with down with zip ties.Again, it didn't work through the aluminum hull of the boat. worked great when I was hanging over the edge with clear line of sight... This year I might try tossing it off the side of the boat tied down with some 50 lb test power pro. If that doesn't work then I just wasted some money...If anyone knows a wireless portable depth finding solution that works through an aluminum hull let me know!"
1193276,bartidge,2010-04-25 18:37:00,12,"I have the Hummingbird Smartcast RF20.https://www.firstchoicemarine.com/p-...-w-sensor.aspx I bought it late last year to use with a sit-on-top fishing kayak I have on a lake in the Adirondacks. I was only able to use it once, but it seemed to work fine... Instead of casting with it, I put the wireless transducer on a leader and attached the leader to the rudder bracket on the kayak. It worked well in marking fish except when really paddling hard and fast (the turbulence from fast paddling and the rudder caused the transducer signal to drop.) Anyways, It seemed to mark pockets of fish pretty well (even though I couldn't catch them!... I went out middle of the day and was likely marking walleye and/or smallmouths and it was high noon and sunny... i.e. nothing was hitting...) I spent about 5 hours with the unit on and the battery last fine for me... Chris"
1194043,brwhite,2010-04-27 17:30:00,41,"This got me looking into wireless depth finders again, and I ran into this:http://www.carpforum.co.uk/Shared/Me...TopicID=149336It outlines how to cut open a smartcast transducer and install your own antenna to increase range (solves my aluminum boat problem) and how to make it run off of AA batteries.I've got my own version of parts on order from digikey already!"
1194682,bassface44,2010-04-29 08:59:00,96,"phish, Just curious, what are you guys using now? We have been through almost every portable option that has been out there and a few home brew portables as well. We are mainly using Humminbird 535's from a few years ago with the hard cases and we have one 565 in a soft case. Battery life has been pretty decent with 2 6v lantern batteries for the 535's and the 12v gel cells for the 565. The resolution and image on these units have been amazing compared to everything else we have brought with us in the past. I can watch my jig in 40ft no problem and watch fish come off the bottom for it. Great units. They still have the cord and suction cup to worry about but they have been great for us. Thought I would at least mention them."
