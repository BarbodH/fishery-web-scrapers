What are the typical patterns in a NORMAL August on Lac Seul. Where would be the best places to target. Depths and Techniques? Thanks for any help. Joe"

1194264,SeulAreaWalleye,2010-04-28 10:56:00,100,"In a normal August on Seul look for flat areas around 30 ft of water, while marking a straight line of baitfish tight to bottom on your graph. These are smelt...the main diet in August. Often ""dead sticking"" with live bait is the key to success here.Good Luck"

1195084,davenathe,2010-04-30 08:28:00,113,"August in the best time for Lac Seul. Water is higher, bugs are almost non-existent, walleyes are on the bite. Fish points and sunken islands anywhere from 15 to 35ft, it might take the 1st day to pattern the fish but once you do catching 50-100 walleye a day can be done. First, if we do not graph fish we do not fish a spot. Once located, suggest start with 1-2oz bottom bouncer so can cover water quicker. We use primarily 1/2 night crawler on a single hook, with a 4 to 7ft snell. If want more info send PM Deacon"
