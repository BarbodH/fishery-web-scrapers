I imagine the walleye will be in their mid june patterns by than based upon the warm weather they are having up north. Could anyone provide me with locations for this time. I do have a gps on my boat, and enjoy boat rides, so distance is not an issue within reason. (30 miles is fine) Any info you can provide to help enhance my friends experience would be appreciated. Also, any rocky areas to worry about would help. Thanks in advance."
