Where are you staying and what lakes are you fishing? I've been wanting to get back to that area for years and fish a few old favorite lakes. I just haven't had time yet and this year isn't looking good either. Maybe next year (I hope)."

(Not Much) that I know of. If there is I haven't found it. After 10- years.of me going there, You would be better off waiting until you get to Nakina's only rest. 1.5 hours. Maybe something new in the last year I don't know about. Good luck. We're (9) of us going back to Brace Lake this year to Brace Lake Outfitters in the last week of August, let me know when you go if you find something good. Thanks,Rob"

Make sure you stop by World Famous Skinner's Acre for a great selection of tackle and a fishing update from Tim. There is great fishing in Longlac, Long Lake has almost no fishing pressure if you are willing to run South, some great Laker fishing as well."
