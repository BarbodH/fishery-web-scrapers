Can someone varify this for me.And and maybe a Ice out update and possible spawn timing for the lake.As I have learned over the past years of fishing the spawn timing for thefor this large lake , is different for the different parts of the lake. Planning on being there June 5-14 and hoping it will better than 2009 spring.Thanks for any updates"
1194654,JDP,2010-04-29 07:40:00,1457,"Crazydog:Lac Seulâ€™s April 12th level of 1164 feet is: - same as April 15, 2009 (1164 ft.)- 1 foot below April 15,2008 (1165 ft.)- 2 feet above April 15,2007 (1162 ft.) The level on April 22nd was still 1164ft.One of the main issues with the water level is that ther was an early snow melt, much earlier than the past couple of years, thus rainfall is needed in a BIG way. Conditions are very dry, there is severe fire danger in NWO.You can follow the lake level on this site: http://www.lwcb.ca/"

I wish you all the best for the season....Rob at Cherob Resort"" Last Sunday I spoke to Keith owner at Fisherman's Cove and he said the water level at Lac Seul now is pretty normal for this time of year. However, he said it is very dry and rain is badly needed. I live in NE MN and thankfull that we are FINALLY getting some rain tonight and next few days......grass and forest fires have been a real problem around here. 3 months and counting down the days to fishing on LAC SEUL!
