I'm thinking about a houseboat rental, and tow our boat behind it for fishing and tubing. Or a fly-in somewhere in southern Ontario, where we can fly from the International Falls or Dryden area to a remote resort that still has fairly decent amenities for the girls. Or maybe just drive into southern Canada to a really nice resort with more kid activities than just fishing. Any ideas, or referalls? I have only been to Canada 2 times myself, many years ago, once to LOW, and once to Lac Suel. Thanks guys!"

Also, you may want to go to one that cooks for you so there are different options for the kids. Most camps will give you a discount on kids....How far do you want to drive? I personally am looking at taking my will be 10 year old boy to Anglerskingdom.com. I have read and looked at a ton of post and camps. There is or should be enough with keeping him busy. Kids no matter the age are usually only happen when they are catching fish. The price of Anglerskingdom is very good and the accomadations are top notch. I am looking forward to some other responses."

If your girls are fine with ""the outdoors"" a canou/camping trip might not be a bad idea. Great fishing is important, but so are adventures that take place without a rod and reel in your hand. It all depends on what type of trip and how much money you're looking for. If you can give us a little more info... there's a lot of well experienced Canadian travlelers on here."
1195093,Guest,2010-04-30 08:51:00,0,"Thanks for the info so far. I'm just starting to investigate what would be best for the kids and be an experience that they will remember forever. I'd like to stay within an hour or two of the MN border. If we fly past that, that would be fine since that is a bonus compared to being in the truck. We live in Iowa and will have 11+ hours to get to Int. Falls. Price, well, it's hard to put a price on fun, but $2-3000 is a good plenty for me and 3 kids for 4 days. I want to drive all day Thursday, be there for Fri, Sat, Sunday, Monday, and drive all day Tuesday getting home. A clean lake without the algae bloom that LOW gets is a must for swimming. We will be going the 2nd wekend of August. I want it to be something unique, so I guess I'm leaning toward the houseboat or the fly-in. Both are things that I have never done either. thanks again guys!"

So, if you're looking for clear water... those two would be good areas.http://www.whitefishbaycamp.com/ Bob and Peg are wonderful people, and would be excellent hosts."
