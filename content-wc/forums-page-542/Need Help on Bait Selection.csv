1193948,drlee,2010-04-27 11:42:00,409,"I will be spending a month in northern Ontario again this year...can't wait! The camps where I fish are drive-in, but remote. Live minnows are really not a good option. We have used crawlers and leeches, but salt minnows have been more effective for us in the past. I have responsibility for 5 other guys on my first trip, in terms of bait selection. The bait shop I use in Wisconsin is a good one, but they changed suppliers for their salt minnows and I have not been very happy with the new supplier. I have since looked at the fathead minnows (large) that are preserved in plastic and for sale at Cabelas and Fleet Farm...probably other places as well. I have used a few of them...vertical jigging, drifting, cast and retrieve and have been a bit disappointed. They don't seem to stay on the hook as well as the salt minnows we have used in other years. They certainly would be very handy to work with, the price is right (less than $1 a dozen, just like the salt minnows), and they do seem to ""keep"" very well. So, has anyone used these minnows? Results? How well do they stay on the hook? Any information would be greatly appreciated. BTW, an unsolicited comment: Austin's Wilderness Lodge on Lake Pashkokogan and Press Lake Camp on Press Lake, both north of Ignace, are excellent camps. I have fished about 25 lakes in northern Ontario over the years and have, as a retiree, narrowed it down to these two camps. They are remote, but drive-in, and I just have to fish out of my own boat! The lakes are relatively easy to fish, plenty of water but you don't have to run an hour to get to ""spots."" Rivers and creeks in and out; no private cabins on either system, only one camp (seven cabins) on Press and two small camps on Pashkokogan. Biggest problem: Getting a cabin before late summer/early fall is a tough duty. Repeat business is what its all about. Sorry to be so long winded, but I had a few minutes to kill before I head out on the White River in Arkansas to fish for trout...I only have three days left out of my month long stay in the beautiful Mountain Home area. Boy, am I obnoxious, or what?"
1193965,camp chef,2010-04-27 12:44:00,915,We use Magic Products Inc. preserved shiners.They have worked great for us.The company is in Amherst Jct. Wisconsin and sells in Bulk 1# bags. They also have fatheads. You can see on their website.

We use a variety of primarily three inch grubs, and swimmin minnows and have had very good luck. My personal favorite is the Kalins blue pearl, salt and pepper. Tight lines"

1194410,Bigstorm,2010-04-28 16:30:00,799,Ever try salting your own fatheads? I salt about 20doz every year before I go to Canada.
