1107975,Guest,2009-05-25 18:24:00,0,Osama is the bar keep at the Viking you want to talk to.. They shuttle American fisherman over for a fee and import BC bud on the way back. Americans have a huge appetite for BC bud. Apparently he is busy and runs several shifts a day because of the huge number of convicted american felons who want to catch canadian walleye and break our laws. He also arranges flight lessons on Jet simulators at various points in the US. He only accepts cash. Apparently as long as you have the cash they will train you on a simulator even though you have no real reason for being there.
1194571,fishforlife,2010-04-29 01:08:00,77,"Canadian Guy, First let me congratulate you for being the idiot you always are in your rhetorical analysis of the posts made by people who actually care to be informed of how they should comply and react to the laws as they pertain to crossing the border into Canada and upholding the laws of your country. I fought for both of our countries' freedoms in 1969 to make sure you have your rights to voice your opinion freely today, so don't take it lightly that both of our countries are trying to protect us ! You so often try to make this an ""us VS them"" issue and you lose tract of the questions. Try to be objective for once and see the positive side of giving an unbiased and informed answer to the questions asked. OK I've vented, but you better hope we don;t me up at the Viking. ""just kidding"" . Really.try to understand the issues without making the Canadian VS USA being the issues, We, ""Our Countries"" already have our hands full with the idiots that are trying to hurt our relationships with one and other. Remember that we are all Brothers in this war on terrorism. I hope that we mIght meet someday and discuss these things and more over a cold one !!!!Regards,Rob"

If I had been convicted of a crime that would possibly get me turned back, I would stay in the USA. My border crossing last fall was great as usual and the border guard was so nice that I wanted to invite him for a day or two of fishing in my boat. I think that most people that have problems are doing something to trip their trigger. One year when we crossed they seemed to be a bit curt and we found out that they had just caught a guy trying to smuggle cocain in a new Zippo lighter. They gave us a more thorough search than they usually would. I would not like to have their job and have to deal with some of the people that they do."
1107376,Glenman12,2009-05-22 20:16:00,762,I started this thread to gather some info...if it turns into a US vs Canada war of words then I apologize
1107472,evy TN,2009-05-23 11:58:00,15,We had a member of our party last year with a DUI in the last year make it through. He had a rental car reserved in MN just in case he didn't get through. We just handed all the passports over and answered all the questions. I dont believe they do 100% background checks. It's a crapshoot. If they check it would be a bad day. I'd say the whole group would be there for awhile putting your'e vehicle back together..
1107473,Guest,2009-05-23 12:08:00,0,We have two guys from our group who have felonies. Most years we have no problems. Just hand the boarder guards your passports and they ask a couple of questions then wave you through. We go twice a year for 10 years. But twice they have been denied entry into Canada with a more thorough check. If this happens in International Falls just head over to the Viking Bar on 3rd St. Tell the bartender what happened. There are a couple of Canadians that hangout there that make a living shuttling people across the river. It will cost you $100 and a couple of hours waiting. We've never had a problem but I've heard of guys getting ripped off so watch yourself.
1107502,Guest,2009-05-23 16:38:00,0,JinxCanada does a city ordinance violation of disorderly conduct make you inadmissible? Thanks for your opinion Guest
1107514,JinxCanada,2009-05-23 17:55:00,1306,"wow. that is some interesting advice. can i get the names of these canadian who will shuttle you across into Canada in their boats??? just for fun i'm sure we can arrange for you not to get ripped off...but the results...well, you wont' like them trust me. you are advising people to attempt to get smuggled into Canada via a boat? are you completely out of your fricken mind? jesus."
1107515,JinxCanada,2009-05-23 17:55:00,1306,like a drunk in public charge? no not that alone.
1107536,JAY221,2009-05-23 19:45:00,877,"JinxCanada, As I am sure you know it is NOT illegal to be stupid, just the results of acting upon it is what gets you in trouble. I also am one that appreciates & respects the job the guys on both sides of the border do in trying to keep everybody safe. The longest I ever spent at the border was when an officer wanted to know about the wifes Sporttrac. Later, Jay"
1107539,Walleye_Wrangler,2009-05-23 20:02:00,138,"We have 500,000 crossing our southern border illegally every year. If they get caught, not even a slap on the wrist, we feed them and send them back. And we are labeled evil for doing that! Heck we have people setting out food and water in case they get hungry or thirsty on there trek."
1107540,JinxCanada,2009-05-23 20:02:00,1306,"um....dude...maybe i should educate you a little...like the USA moron head of homeland security was recently. ABSOLUTELY NONE OF THE 911 Terrorists came from Canada..and that is a proven fact. but i don't expect you to know that since even your super smart (SMRT...i am so smrt! ala Homer Simpson) elected leaders in charge of border security don't even know where the 911 Terrorists came from. it was US Customs/Immigration who let them in, from all over the world..but not ONE of them came from Canada. just FYI.."
1107705,KS TrophyHunter,2009-05-24 15:46:00,10,"Jinxwipe,I asked a legitimate question and Boo answered it legitimately, something that is quite rare on here I might add. That was it! Your rants are getting real boring and OFF POINT. No where was he suggesting this avenue, only pointing out a fact: OUR BORDER IS A JOKE (BOTH WAYS)."
1107123,Glenman12,2009-05-22 07:38:00,762,"To make a long story short, one of the guys in our group plead guilty to simple battery the other day..I know that he shouldnt be able to cross the border because of this..he wants to go so bad that he's going to try to cross in hopes that the border people just question him and dont run him in the computer..this is his decision.. Ok, heres my question..we heard thru the grapevine that people in this situation are allowed to cross if they put up a cash bond, supposedly several hundred dollars..not even sure if you get it back..has anyone else ever heard of this?.."
1107139,IowaDave,2009-05-22 08:09:00,69,I'd make sure that he either has a seperate vehicle or enough money for a week (or however long you're going to be gone) in a motel room. In the event that they don't let him through it would really ruin the trip if all of you had to turn back.
1107173,Glenman12,2009-05-22 09:34:00,762,He will be in his own vehicle..if he doesnt get across he is going to drive to Hayward Wis where he has an uncle with a house on a lake and fish there for a week
1107174,jigman 2003,2009-05-22 09:34:00,981,"Yep, me too"
1107224,cast_and_blast,2009-05-22 11:35:00,1098,Being in his own vehicle ups the chance that everything will be found. They will run his plate and make sure that the owner of the vehicle is in there (doesn't have to be the driver). When they run his plate and the name pops up who knows what other info will be available to the customs agent? Make a call to Canadian Customs and get the info first hand. Scott
1107245,jigman 2003,2009-05-22 12:34:00,981,"Yep. My understanding is that your entire record is available thru your passport. Could be wrong, but I recall someone here that was in law enforcement stating that before."
1107278,KS TrophyHunter,2009-05-22 14:14:00,10,"Just curious and certainly not advocating this, but what is to stop a determined USA CRIMINAL from launching a boat on the US side and getting out on the Canadian side, then having his buddies pick him up after they go thru customs? This would seem particularly easy at International Falls/Fort Frances.Obviously someone would have drive the boat back across, I would imagine a boatless trailer would raise eyebrows at the border crossing."
1107307,JinxCanada,2009-05-22 15:30:00,1306,"sorry to tell ya but that is 100% INCORRECT. he is criminally inadmissable to Canada. period. if he is refused, you will have to take him back to the USA and drop him off. just fyi. i wouldn't risk brining him...his charge equates to assault here, which is an indictable offensebtw..the money i think you are referring to is a processing application for criminal rehabilitation through the Canadian Consulate for minor offenses which have ocurred over 10 years prior with no further offenses being committed/convictions durring that time. an example would be a DUI with no other convictions 10 years prior to the application. and there is never a ""guarantee"" they will find you rehabilitated and allow you to make application to cross into Canada."
1107308,JinxCanada,2009-05-22 15:32:00,1306,"there is nothing to stop anyone from committing a criminal offense (which that would be btw) other than the threat of jail, incarceration, fines, and being deported from Canada with pretty much no chance of ever getting back in again. but hey, that's just me. why not go ahead and try it. let us all know how it works out for ya."
1107367,Glenman12,2009-05-22 19:41:00,762,"sorry to tell ya but that is 100% INCORRECT. he is criminally inadmissable to Canada. period. if he is refused, you will have to take him back to the USA and drop him off. just fyi. i wouldn't risk brining him...his charge equates to assault here, which is an indictable offense"" We all know this and have been telling his this but he wont listen..he will be in his own vehicle by himself pulling his own boat..he is hoping against hope that they will look at his passport, run his plate and send him through.."
