Have had good luck with double gomatsu hooks for crawlers, but recall using a single longer shank hook-- possibly aberdeens(?) for minnows. Anyone have a preffered manufacture/style/size & number to recommend? Thanks in advance, & I promise I wont use them to fish in your secret spot---"

You may think it's strange but the BEST I have found is the heavy wire Red Tru-Turn making sure it has the offset eye for snelling. The new death spin (or something like that) by another manufacturer works on the same principle. I use #2 for minnow spinners. I get very few miss strikes, hooked in the corner of the mouth every time and you know it's been a good day when the red starts comming off.PM me for a more complete description"
