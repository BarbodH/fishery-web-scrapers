1194833,celticbass1,2010-04-29 16:40:00,67,In Canada a case of good beer is going to cost $35-40.00 so buy what you can at the duty free.
1194852,adempsey,2010-04-29 17:42:00,963,"If you're crossing into Ontario:Beer (mostly cans) and Liquor at the LCBO. Open all week, hours vary by location, but typically open either to 9 or 10 PM on Saturday and to 5 or 6 PM on Sunday.Beer at ""The Beer Store"" (used to be called Brewer's Retail). Open all week, hours also vary by location, but typically open to either 9 or 10 PM on Saturday and to 5 or 6 PM on Sunday.Quebec and Manitoba are different. I live in Ontario so I am not sure about these provinces. I believe Manitoba is similar to Ontario, but the stores have different names. Quebec is as posted above."
1194278,Guest,2010-04-28 11:12:00,0,This May for the first time in over twenty years I will be crossing into Canada on a Saturday. Now years ago I know you could not buy beer in Canada on a Sunday. Is this still the rule? If so how late on Saturday can you buy alcohol?
1194301,camp chef,2010-04-28 11:52:00,915,You should check out the beer store web site.I think hours vary by location
1194304,Desrosiers,2010-04-28 11:56:00,19,"Most, if not all, are open on Sunday. Shorter hours, usually noon till 5."
1194386,Guest,2010-04-28 15:09:00,0,"Huh, I'm guessing you may not know this but you can buy beer in the USA also."
1194397,camp chef,2010-04-28 15:37:00,915,Why would you buy beer in the U.S. when you are going to Canada? That would be like taking tequila on a trip to Mexico.
1194420,Cut a deal,2010-04-28 16:49:00,38,There was a rumor years ago if you found a mouse in a beer bottle you could get a free case.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsgVspgy184
1194423,hogridnfool,2010-04-28 16:58:00,349,"Go to the LCBO website and do a store location search for the area you will be in, there you will find the store hours. For example: Ignace - Sunday 12 - 4, Monday - closed, the rest of the week - 9:30 - 6.Camp Chef; when are you going to be on Indian?"
1194432,camp chef,2010-04-28 17:13:00,915,"Hey Larry, I am not going to Indian this year. We are headed for the Winnipeg river the end of May."

1194452,a3dad,2010-04-28 18:04:00,115,"any suggestions where to stop for beer and liquor in Montreal? Anywhere along route 15. By the way, can you buy both in the same store? Also do food markets sell beer? thanks."
