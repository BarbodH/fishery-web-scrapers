1307954,Knoxabilly,2011-05-17 09:16:00,225,"Hey all, just found out we can take my friends Dad's RV on the Trek to Canada. What would we need to do for that? Since his Dad won't be there and the RV is registered and titled in his name will this be an issue? Anyone know?"
1308031,Knoxabilly,2011-05-17 11:54:00,225,Or who could I call or find out about this?
1308058,JinxCanada,2011-05-17 12:31:00,1306,just get a letter from the owner and you will be fine. you don't need anything technically to use someone else's vehicle here.
1308089,Knoxabilly,2011-05-17 13:11:00,225,Thank you Jinx
1308208,JinxCanada,2011-05-17 17:10:00,1306,"yup. just make sure you leave your guns, throwing stars, switch blades etc at home ok?"

1308344,JinxCanada,2011-05-18 05:17:00,1306,what are you talking about? you don't need a different insurance for Canada. I'm lost here.
1308633,Gary from Iowa,2011-05-18 14:09:00,74,In my experience you typically don't buy additional vehicle insurance for the Canadian trip but you do ask your auto insurance agent for a Canada Insurance Card. This procedure may be a relic of times before you carried a proof on insurance card (Anyway that is what we do in Iowa.) I suggest that the letter from the owner mention those permitted to drive the vehicle. Hope there is no accident but I would hate to see the insurance company try to deny coverage.
