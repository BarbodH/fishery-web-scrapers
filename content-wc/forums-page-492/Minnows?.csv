1307760,elway12,2011-05-16 19:36:00,335,Same as fisherman10. Larry's Bait 807-473-9321 Larry's a great guy and cares about his customers. It is on the left side of the road - drive slow or you'll miss it.
1307794,hogridnfool,2011-05-16 21:08:00,349,"There are two bait shops near Upsala. Kay's Sport and Gift Shop (807)986-2379 and Lac De Mille Bait, Tackle and Restaurant Hyw 17 (807)986-2315. You might consider taking the shortcut around Thunder Bay. https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...ut+Thunder+Bay. You will save time and come out just before Kakabeka Falls. There's a map for the shortcut posted on the wall above the urinal in the mens restroom in the gas station at Rydens."
