1307713,NARDA 1,2011-05-16 17:51:00,636,If you are out on a remote lake and have a medical or other emergency you push a button on the unit and it sends a signal that gives your location so help can be sent to your location.
1307972,MikeMcC,2011-05-17 10:07:00,72,"I would lean more towards bringing a Sat. phone. This way you could actually communicate your exact emergency or needs. I heard that the early SPOT's were not that reliable? A personal locator beacon is probable the most reliable, but to be used only for life or limb type of emergencies."
1308341,Skywagon,2011-05-18 03:48:00,1106,"I flew a young man from the Netherlands out to a remote lake this last fall, to spend two weeks camping. He had a SPOT, the program was to send an OK signal once in the morning and once every evening to insure he was OK (the OK signal was sent to my e-mail address), if we did not get two transmissions in a row, we were to go check on him. We missed a couple of transmissions (not in a row), then missed two in a row and went looking for him. When we got there he was alright, the SPOT just had not got out. We missed another signal after that, the following week.Summary; In an emergency situation, I would not bet my life on SPOT. Renting a Satellite phone would be the best advice. There are companies you can rent from on the internet. Get an Iridium NOT a Globalstar, as they are completely differnt systems and the Globalstar is not that reliable in our part of the world, because of the satellites it uses. As a side note, the SPOT works off the Globalstar system. To warn you, the phone that Dryden Telephone Company rents-sells, is the Globalstar."
