1308691,tackleman,2011-05-18 16:46:00,444,"try Stormer Lake Lodge, it's not a fly-in but it has a great fishing site,,north of Red Lake. The food is great, the staff are friendly and the equipment is top notch. The bonus is it's a heck of a lot cheaper than flying in.Located on Stormer Lake there is a creek that runs into Kirkness and the walleye and northerns are plentiful."
