Anyone on the board fished it before? I've been once, some of the other guys in the group are more seasoned veterans. We have a number of established spots to fish which are all very productive, but I'd like to explore some new locations as well ... if anyone cares to trade info, or recommend some fishing holes I'd love to hear about it! Can't wait for the trip, as usual. Countdown is on!"

AND - please post a trip report!! hope you have a great time. phish"
