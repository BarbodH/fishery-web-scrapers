1307770,Marc63280,2011-05-16 20:04:00,309,Four more days until I'm up there. Whats the water temp like. I see you are having some awesome weather.
1307780,Enid Elizabeth,2011-05-16 20:22:00,59,"glassy water, too warm for cleaning. Can't blame my staff for jumping ship and going fishing for lake trout. even went swimming today but for less than a minute. Yes you better get up to Red Lake right away!"
1308041,Marc63280,2011-05-17 12:06:00,309,I will be leaving Friday evening. Thanks for all the info you have been posting Enid.
1296476,Marc63280,2011-04-18 18:36:00,309,How's the ice looking on Red Lake. Any guesses on when it will be gone?
1296691,SoulFulCry,2011-04-19 09:12:00,158,well after a dam copld front n we got 4 more inches of snow im guessin maybe 2nd week of may i pray sooner but we just havent got the weather to make it go away faster
1296740,Golden Eagle,2011-04-19 11:00:00,2642,"For sure I can leave from the Chukini River, but need to work at landing on Little Vermilion May 14. Seems like the ideal senario for a great two weeks of catching. I know a couple of great spots for pike when ice is still hanging around. I can handle being in camp with frozen water lines. I can drag my boat to the water. Bring it on.What we're getting is exactly what I would have ordered."
1296906,Fishin Fun,2011-04-19 17:47:00,218,I spoke with Mary Spenceley at South Bay on Gull Rock and she's betting ice out at around May 9th or so.
1297606,Enid Elizabeth,2011-04-21 08:53:00,59,"Hugh measured the ice in front of our house yesterday, where there were no skidoo tracks. Surprised to find only 15 inches of ice. 5 inches of that was slush ice. ....so it is disappearing. My wild guess is May 14. I'm trying to put some pictures and videos up as breakup happens, and open water does always get here!http://www.viking-island.blogspot.com/"
1301124,Enid Elizabeth,2011-04-30 09:25:00,59,"On Friday April 29, measured the ice at 8 inches and kind of weak ice at that. Could have sonw today, though. Posted another video at http://www.viking-island.blogspot.com/"
1301181,Golden Eagle,2011-04-30 12:31:00,2642,"Enid, I continue to appreciate your blog and check it every day.Thanks for the update."
1301399,Glenman12,2011-05-01 05:38:00,762,Same here..great blog
1302156,Enid Elizabeth,2011-05-02 17:24:00,59,"Boat is in the water, motor running. Lots of rain on Saturday did a number on the ice, a little snow on Sunday wasn't much of an issue. We'll be flying out of the river by Thursday."
1304022,danlecl,2011-05-07 15:41:00,2,"Good News, no ice to contend with in AZ. Bad News, no walleyes. Looking forward to Stormer wilderness lodge early June!"
