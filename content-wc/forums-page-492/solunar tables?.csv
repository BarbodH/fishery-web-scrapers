1307945,Lovetofish,2011-05-17 08:59:00,458,Interesting subject. When we get to camp there is a calendar on the wall which indicates the bite for each day. Don't think it's been right or wrong because the fishing has always been good to great. But I do remember this statement from our camp owner. She said it usually storms just before or on a new moon. Sure as heck we had a dandy of storm a day or two later that dumped a couple inches of rain in short order. We fished the last two days in the rain.
1307626,duffitdad,2011-05-16 14:02:00,21,I am just curious what you folks think of solunar tables for best and worst fishing periods as they relate to your trips in canada. Any thoughts good bad or indifferent??
1307650,Mohleye,2011-05-16 15:15:00,368,"We have a hard enough time finding a week that works for 6 people without worrying about that. When we are there we are going to fish all day, so the time of day part is irrelevant too. For our group they are not a factor at all."
1307655,NemegosendaRiver,2011-05-16 15:28:00,66,Nor are they a factor for ours. We have a guy who got a fishing watch (gives the best fishing times depending on the day) as a gift and takes it with him. We laugh every time that thing beeps because we are usually in the cabin eating. I just checked the calendar for our trip dates this year and it says it will be the poorest conditions of the month. We will catch hundreds of Walleye a day.

1307731,bigwalleye1,2011-05-16 18:39:00,2632,"Ignore the tables. To quote my Canadian mentor, Mr. Hedley, ""The fish ALWAYS bite in Canada"". Been going 12 years, he hasn't been wrong yet. Fishing so good, you'll swear it's yesterday (as in...shoulda been here.......) Additionally, I'd suggest the fish can't read the tables, the whole time/space continuum is adversely affected by the passage over the border, beer tastes better in the woods, shorelunch is Vastly underrated, the exchange rate works in your favor (one walleye from MN is worth at least 20 in Canada on a bad trip), it's a shorter growing season so the fish feed harder, the best color for jigs is the one presently tied to your line, the WORSt color is the one on your buddy's line, bananas in the boat is bad juju, turn around 3 times before you lay down, just once during the trip stop and ask yourself what the poor people are doing today, and then just get on the water and do it. If you bring the tables, look at them afterward to see if they helped."
1307766,phishfearme,2011-05-16 19:52:00,1242,"in addition to bigwalleye1's excellent quote - let me add one more that's equally profound - ""the best time to fish is whenever you can!"" add this quote to the other one and leave the tables at home. phish"
1307775,Larry S,2011-05-16 20:16:00,665,"Bring,minnows,leeches,crawlers and plugs. Catch all your fish on jig & tails!!."
1307828,Mike Borger,2011-05-17 03:13:00,1554,I agree with all of the sentiments expressed.But there's also no doubt there's validity to the moon phase theory.More larger fish are caught in and around the new and full moons.If your trip happens to fall in a prime moon phase so much the better.
1307855,gmattbruin,2011-05-17 05:43:00,174,"My grandfather always used to say it was important. In southern ont.(South of Nipissing), I think it matters. North,especially on fly-ins,probably not so much. Not much seems to affect the fishing there,weather,mayflies,etc,we have always caught pickerel and northerns. Solopaddler,check your messages,I replyed to an earlier request you sent me in regards to abamasagi,I apologize for the delay"
1307857,Hawker,2011-05-17 06:01:00,3967,"While I don't ""rely"" on the solunar tables to dictate when I plan my trips, over the years I have watched them to see how they correlate to my actual results! Scoff if you will, but I too have one of those watches that tell you the best times and time of the day for fishing (while in Canada & at home) and when set right (location) it's pretty reliable!! Strong frontal changes (weather) does play a factor of course, but overall I think utilizing the solunar tables is just another good tool to use when planning a fishing trip be it a day trip or extended trip!"
