1308491,camp chef,2011-05-18 09:40:00,915,we have never had a problem with other fresh produce
1308493,JDP,2011-05-18 09:41:00,1457,"Scroll down and read under ""fruits and vegetables: fresh""http://www.beaware.gc.ca/english/brirape.shtml20 kilograms is roughly 44 pounds per person"
1308503,jswinter40,2011-05-18 09:59:00,127,sorry to offend Camp Chef. I knew we always stopped for potatoes and got other fresh stuff up there but didn't really know why. good to know.
1308514,Guest,2011-05-18 10:22:00,0,I'm happy to see the Canadian Government spelled potatoes correctly
1308525,phishfearme,2011-05-18 10:33:00,1242,"well, it's about time - it was always a hastle to make a specific stop for a few potatos. thanks for the responses. phish"
1308533,SSH,2011-05-18 10:47:00,526,"I buy cans of potatoes. there are whole and sliced. They cook faster than raw potatoes and tast erally good with onions/cheese. If you use them for baked potatoes, then, you will need raw whole potatoes."
1308538,bigwalleye1,2011-05-18 11:01:00,2632,"An end to the great Canadian potato ban! Perhaps we can bring more beer as well, just to celebrate????"
