1306114,rigger1,2011-05-12 12:20:00,35,"I love Lac Suel and the fishing is great. I have however noticed a decline in large walleyes in last couple years. I mean walleyes over 28"". Has anyone else noticed this? Maybe there is a gap in year classes of Large eyes now?"
1306117,wallydave,2011-05-12 12:50:00,2151,"I have always fished the Ear Falls section of LS, usually spring. We have had great numbers 28 and above! When and where you go might effect your catch, but that is a guess on my part!"
1306134,jswinter40,2011-05-12 13:41:00,127,"We fish the east/northeast side of Lac Seul and we find it varies year to year. but last couple of years there have been a lot of the under 17"" fish. i think this only says great things about the future. 4 years ago 1 got 3 28"" eyes on consecutive drops of the jig. i really think it depends on the time of year (weather has not been on ""normal"" patterns for the past couple of years if you fish the same time each year) and the type of structure you are fishing. Can't wait to get up there in july. I really enjoy more stable weather and schooling walleyes on deeper, predictable structure.By the way guys, does anyone do really well on leeches in the summer. By well I mean better than crawlers. debating buying some for our houseboat trip. we usually always use crawlers, minnow and plastics."
1306181,wallydave,2011-05-12 17:14:00,2151,"We have had good luck with leeches, on warmer sunny day at the westend, even seen some leeches swimming against the current! Cooler cloudy days stick with the minnows!"
1307591,tv4fish,2011-05-16 12:41:00,2694,Just a FWIW -- We go up the last week of June/first week of July. 2 guys typically use crawlers - 1 guy uses leeches. The guys with crawlers seem to always do better.
1307912,wallydave,2011-05-17 08:04:00,2151,"It seems things are quiet out there, I just heard from Andrea at Goose Bay Camp, she had a 4 person cabin just open up for the week of June 4-11, less than 3 weeks away. It sounds like a group had to back out at the last minute! Job, health and scheduling issues happen, like the weather no one can control these things, they just happen. I hope she can fill that cabin, but it might be hard this late in the game. If anything good can come of it, my two person group, may have a bigger cabin! So if a group needs a cabin near the Ear Falls section of Lac Seul, there is an opening!"
1303453,bpetersen,2011-05-05 20:55:00,251,Is it just me or is there less chatter on here about Lac Seul this year?
1303514,gravelrash30,2011-05-06 05:50:00,14,"I would have to agree with you, I look on here every day and post every once in awhile.it seems like alot of people have stopped posting on here and If I had to guess why,id say people are getting tired of -------#1 when asking question -- some of the same people have to make it into absolutly nothing about what the question was.#2 always being told to just look it up (search)and so onjust look back through recent posts and you will see what Im talking about, seems like when you ask anything on here any more if you get one or two replys your doing good unless its about beer , for example look at that spawning question I know theres tons of people that have fisheda lake that has had a late ice out, maybe its just the fishermans hot spot lip lock thats gotten ahold of them! But I love looking on this site"
1303537,JDP,2011-05-06 06:56:00,1457,"I believe there are fewer people travelling to Lac Seul (Canada for that matter) versus past years. Thus, less interest in the Canada forum. I point out that there have been a number of threads dedicated to trips falling apart due to job loss, etc.As for the ""search for it"" comment:Many followers of the Canada Forum have been doing so for years.Therefore when they see a post asking about a resort, lake, etc. they recall a thread or threads covering the topic. If you perform a search you can get immediate answers and opinions from a number of people that had different experiences. Then if questions still remain by all means post a thread do not fear those that direct others to perform searches."
1303597,wallydave,2011-05-06 08:41:00,2151,"it does seem to be quiet on the Canadian front in general, and LS included. Like JDP, posted, it seems that fewer people are heading North, other posters have speculated that some camps may be selling thier cabins to private owners, if the trend of fewer walleye wramglers continues.I know our group has gone from three cabins and 3-4 boats has been reduced to 2 cabins and two boats. We keeep inviting new people to join us, but we have not had much luck, although this year I will be taking a guy for his first Canadian trip, I hope this will be a new start for our group! We keep fishing when the bite is tough, we just have to keep inviting new people up North."
1303647,Bill Krejca,2011-05-06 10:29:00,6107,"Re: ""Search for it"" - Yeah, many times some of us may remember lengthy discussions on a topic, and refer person to that. After researching and reading those previous posts, if questions remain, this should in no way stop the person from continuing to seek info. Re: Lac Suel in particular - It has been a very popular subject on this board, but queries don't seem to have slacked off any more that for other places. Perhaps those who go there may be more aware of less post interest than those of us not frequenting it. Bill"
1304218,davenathe,2011-05-08 08:41:00,113,A lot quieter on most forums these days. Financial times are changing trips to Canada. We have a group of 6 but only 3-4 steadies always filling one or 2 spots.
1304230,BenBeattie,2011-05-08 09:15:00,232,"This year is shaping up to the busiest summer in recent memory. I'm down to single didgit's in terms of days available from Opener to Sept 1st. Not sure if that's the trend across NW Ontario. I do see a lot of repeat guests, so perhaps there's less chatter because a lot of the guys coming up have 'been there, done that' and don't talk as much on the forums."
1304249,v-bay gord,2011-05-08 10:09:00,3168,"My observation has been that there has been more posts on other lakes....which I think is great. To me that is more interesting than just talking about Lac Suel....a great lake, I'm sure, but not the only spot on the map. There probably is truth to the fact that less people seem to have the cash to travel these days, which might slow down the chatter....but then again, chatter is free, as are anticipating future trips when times are better!"
1304328,81Saluki,2011-05-08 16:53:00,97,"I haven't noticed a substantial decrease in posts for info on specific resorts or lakes this winter. However, I've noticed fewer boats on the water each year over the past few years. There was a time not too long ago when we would count 2 dozen other boats in our vicinity. Last year, the most we counted was 9. That's good for us and the fishery, but not so good for the camps. There are plenty of fish (big ones too) in the water to go around so I hope the bottom has been hit and things pick up for the camp/lodge owners."
1305974,wallydave,2011-05-12 07:42:00,2151,"I have just a few weeks to go before we point the SUV Northwards! All of the planning, shopping and yes lusting for the trip are taking a backseat at least temporarily, for the final touches of the work and home ""honey do's""! Sounds like the ice is off most of the lakes now, but the calendar is still the main obstacle! Now we can wait for the opening season reports and hope they leave the rest of us a few eaters for shore lunch!"
