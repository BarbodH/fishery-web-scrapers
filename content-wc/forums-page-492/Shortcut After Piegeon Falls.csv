It will save you some time if you're heading west and, yes, the roads are good, just pay attention to the speed limits. I've heard they like to run radar there but have never seen them doing it in all my trips. Now Upsala is a different story, I see them there almost every trip."
1308281,hogridnfool,2011-05-17 20:15:00,349,Upsala also has DWI roadblocks. Came upon one at 3:00 on a Saturday afternoon.
1308286,guidedfishing,2011-05-17 20:20:00,531,"It actually comes out just to the east of K falls, once you come across the River and thru Stanley. It is closely watched last year one of our group did get pulled over and received a stern warning but no ticket. The posted limit all thru here is relatively slow and its easy to speed. We have also seen the game warden setup game/fish check station where 130 runs back into 61. Everyone with a boat was pulled over and went thru. I've only seen this twice in 50 plus trips thru here. The OPP seem to have really picked up once they paved the river road a few years ago. Still a good shortcut good luck GF"
533269,Andyeye,2003-07-07 08:29:00,179,We are headed up to the Town of English River East of Ignace next month. I have been told that ther is a shortcut about 24 miles past Pigeon Falls that goes on gravel for a few miles but saves a lot going around Thunder Bay. The gravel is suppose to take you back around to Highway 17. Anybody out ther have info on this shortcut or wher I might get some more detailed maps showing the roads involved. I appreciate any info you have on this.
533274,Guest,2003-07-07 10:04:00,0,I live in Thunder Bay and am unaware of any realistic route. You can shave some miles off by going down Hwy 130 and meeting up 11-17 again but the going can be rough. Stay on the main roads is my advice.
533300,Guest,2003-07-07 16:13:00,0,"Check out map at http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/tra...r_bay_area.pdf. It is a road map of the Thunder Bay area. I think we took Hwy. 130 per our advice of our outfitter in Ignace by the looks of the map. It was a blacktop road with several turns but there was little traffic on it. We haven't went that way for about 6 years so I don't know about road conditions now. We never went into Thunder Bay so I can't say how those roads would be as far as traffic, etc. Good luck."
533347,Guest,2003-07-08 21:30:00,0,I have been taking the shortcut for about twenty years. I'll get back with the details as I don't remember the names of the roads.
533357,Guest,2003-07-09 08:01:00,0,about 27 miles from the border is hwy 130. turn left then appr. 5 mles you come to a T in the road. turn left there. Proceed on that road till you come to the first roadon your right. that is River RD. follow that till you come to the first stop sign.Now turn right which is hwy 588 at Stanely follow 588 to hwy 17 west. Shortcut saves about 30 minutes drive time. By the way shortcur is posted above mens urinal at Ryden's border gas station
533358,Mahumba,2003-07-09 08:12:00,345,Nite Crawler has it correct. (I live in the area he is describing and also a volunteer firefighter and know my way around.) There are shorter short cuts that cuts distance but not travel time because of gravel and rough roads. River road is gravel but well maintained. Roger Mayer.
533369,Guest,2003-07-09 12:12:00,0,I've been both ways and I perfer to use HWY 130 to connect to 11-17 west. I didn't see much difference in time savings and what savings there may have been didn't justify driving on the gravel roads. TGG
561607,Guest,2006-10-14 17:54:00,0,The dirt road is now paved.
1308154,elway12,2011-05-17 14:51:00,335,Can someone give me an update on this post and shortcut? I am alittle confused on the route. Looking at Google maps I see that going north on Rt. 130 goes into a T then you could either go back east to get on 17 or it looks like you could go west on Barrie Rd/Rt.130 then connect with 588 and take that up to Kakabeka Falls/17. Do anyone use that 588? It is less or more miles or how much time does it save if any? Also I didn't know how rough or paved the River road is to take that route as well?
1308160,camp chef,2011-05-17 15:01:00,915,Yes it goes through Kakabeka falls and saves enough time to stop and see the falls. Well worth it if you haven't already
