So if you happen to be flying in to either of these airports from the US you might want to check into this. http://ckdr.net/news/index.php#23194 you will have to scan to the story titled: Customs Service Gone at 3 Area Airports"

If you are coming into Canada by commercial flight, your first stop will be at another airport anyway (Winnipeg, Thunder Bay) where there is Customs, so that takes care of that problem. If you are coming direct in a privite plane, the alternatives for Customs are Ft Frances if you are on wheels or floats and Crane Lake for floats only. Yes, an extra stop would be a pain."
