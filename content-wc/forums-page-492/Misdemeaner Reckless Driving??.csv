1305658,jswinter40,2011-05-11 13:53:00,127,I have a friend that would like to come with us this summer to Lac Suel. He had a misdemeaner reckless driving offense 8 years ago. Will he have trouble crossing the border? No other offenses in his life (mid-30's).thanks in advance.
1305921,Mark R,2011-05-12 05:57:00,1538,why doesn't he call the border and talk to the immigration offical and ask them?
1305926,rebs,2011-05-12 06:17:00,7587,"go straight to the horses mouth so to speak, call the Canadian Authorities and you will know for sure."
1306191,NARDA 1,2011-05-12 17:46:00,636,Make sure you talk to the authorities at the border you are going to cross and make sure you get their name for reference.
1308062,JinxCanada,2011-05-17 12:37:00,1306,reckless driving is not equatable to a criminal offence here. he will be fine..but call any immigration office to double check and make sure that is actually what he was convicted of.
1308508,jswinter40,2011-05-18 10:04:00,127,thanks everybody. it was actually a careless driving offense and is no problem. everyone have safe trip
1308624,JinxCanada,2011-05-18 13:55:00,1306,"ya I just double checked and if it was reckless causing bodily harm or the like then yes it would equate, but if it's just a traffic ticket then no. make sense?"
