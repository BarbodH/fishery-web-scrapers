1306770,Gary from Iowa,2011-05-14 14:08:00,74,"Bow Narrows is a good mid grade resort with good help, good boats and motors. Not too fancy but good value for the money. My brothers and I and nephew did a 6 day housekeeping stay in late July two years ago (the entire group did not go fishing last year and those of us who did went on a short trip closer to the border) At Bow Narrows we mainly caught Walleyes using jigs tipped with nightcrawers, many of Walleyes in the 20 to 25 inch range. Northern pike were few. As the name suggests the fishing is protected, so you can usually get out and fish. The boats were 16 foot Lunds with electric start Honda's. Part of the package price includes the fish being cleaned for you. They do a nice job. As I recall the owner's wife is in charge of the meals for those on the American Plan (most guests are, but you have your choice). I know for a fact that they make an excellent lemon merengue pie. They had college students helping out during the summer vacations. They were hard working and personable. I looked forward to seeing and chatting with them each day.Our cabin had two floors with single beds upstairs. The furniture in the living room is rustic pine and looks nice but can be hard to sit on for a long period of time. You might want to bring a cushion or a foam pad if you plan on lounging in the cabin. We enjoyed the trip to and from camp in the boat ""Lickedty Split"" I think this camp enjoys a high repeat business. It was an enjoyable trip and, if things work out, I would like to go back.Gary"

We did the Housekeeping Plan, brought our own food and make our meals whick I think was cheaper, and we stayed in the same cabin too (#9 I think?). Anyway, the accomodations are really good and I can't complain one bit and the price is right. The fishing could've been better (cool weather and cold fronts with rain) but we caught fish after a little work to figure them out. Our best luck was jigs with minnows on the back sides of the islands where we were protected by the wind. For me the best luck I had for Pike were on using spinner baits (like bass fishing) tipped with a trailer hook and twister tail. Here is their website. Read the blog for useful information..http://bownarrows.com/I'll be back in 2012p.s. I second Gary on the recommendation of bringing cushions or padding for the chairs. Ok, if I had one minor complaint, it's that. Their chairs in the cabin su_K!And oh yeah, don't feed Sam (the camp dog) and watch your hat when he's around! :-)"
1307406,stevensinks,2011-05-16 06:51:00,330,I have been going to Bow Narrows for the last 4 years now. The first year was with a group of guys the first week of june. Now my wife and I go the last week of July Most years the only problem we have had is catching walleye small enough to keep and eat. We will be there this July and I cant wait. Gary are you going north this year?
1308745,Toddskie,2011-05-18 18:53:00,11,"Thanks for the great responses! Bow Narrows sounds like a good place. The other resorts we are looking at are Lost Island on Lac Suel and Mattice Lake Outfitters (Short Lake camp). This site has given me good info on those... now we just have to decide!Thanks, Toddskie"
