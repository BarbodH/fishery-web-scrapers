I am wondering what lures, colors, depth (july 8 - 16th) and possible areas to try. I have been going for 8 years to that part of the lake and know the area fairly well but we always fish walleyes. (fish banana to bear, pine point to entrance to Sen - for walleyes) I am going with some freinds that would like to get some muskie fishing in too this year. If my questions are too specific if you could give general advice or PM me, I would appreciate it. thanks again"

Colours... black/orange, blue silver bucktails, chart/black, perch colours are my fav's.Finding cabbage weeds is key to success. They also love stumpy bays, sandbars and reefs close to shore. Anywhere that a small island or rock is close to shore and makes a saddle is a good bet. If I wasn't booked up the entire time you're here I'd offer to take you out. Maybe next year."

Hunt until you locate it, and visit this fish repeatedly until it decides it's time to strike! This lake is full of undiscovered spots, and I personally I come across surprises each season. I am booked solid as well, for the entire time that you are here. I can only suggest pure focus and commitment to musky, using all of they best gear and tactics out there. Figure eight every cast on this dark water! Ben's advice to you was about as good as it can get without having one of us along for direction or instruction. Many times I have told someone a spot, only to have them see nothing time after time. If they do not approach the area within a certain distance from the cover that they are holding, or present the right lure under the right condition, things will not work the same. Guides can teach a fisherman lots of spots and techniques through advice and suggestions, but this is a species that requires personal, on the water time. Pure luck can play a large factor on Lac Seul and I wish you and your fishing party the best of it! Go find a monster, and enjoy your trip!"
