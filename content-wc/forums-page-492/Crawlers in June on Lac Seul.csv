But with the minnows giving gold a run for its money thought about trying night crawlers this year. I've used them later in the summer. How about early? P.S. I know ""just use Gulp"""
1307971,wallydave,2011-05-17 10:07:00,2151,"Minnows are part of the package at Goose Bay, we have used leeches on warmer sunny days, never tried crawlers before, how well do they work? Fishing buddies have told me they use a syringe to pump air into the crawlers in Ontario, but never tried it myself. We have always done pretty well with the camp minnows. It never hurts to try something new!"
1307973,cuamb,2011-05-17 10:09:00,203,All we use are crawlers that same week. No problem at all. Buy them by the flat. We only use a small piece on a jig with a twister tail or a whole one and a spinner rig.
1307983,fishman10,2011-05-17 10:28:00,226,i use them more into the middle of summer as i pick them and i cant afford the price of minnows anymore. worms work great in mid summer and i am sure they will work also in june.
1307998,jswinter40,2011-05-17 10:56:00,127,We usually are on Lac Seul the 3rd week of June. We always take crawlers. use minnows too. We find the warmer the spring has been the sooner crawlers come into their own. have had times when they outfish the minnows. Number #1 presentaion for us with crawlers = 3/16 oz Precision H2O jig from BFISHN tackle (now owned by custom jigs and spins) in their chartruese sunburst color with a half crawler fed onto the jig like you would a plastic worm. we are going up the second week of July this year so I fully anticipate crawlers to be in full gear. we'll probably get some leeches up there too this year per others recomendations but I have never used them up there because the bait shop we use usually have some pretty sorry looking leeches. Crawlers can be bought or plucked and brought across the border at a much cheaper price.
1308033,Mike Kansas,2011-05-17 11:54:00,1463,"Yes Crawlers work in June on Lac Seul. Put them on a harness, a jig , swimbait, plain hook, crankbait...you name it they work."
1308397,chock,2011-05-18 07:22:00,19,"We always go up the same time around the second week in June. We always take crawlers just in case our minnows run out. They definately work but nowhere near as good as minnows. They seem to work better than gulp, though."
1308403,Mike Kansas,2011-05-18 07:27:00,1463,"Crawlers seem to work the best in windy conditions on jigs. But there are many days that they will out fish minnows in all conditions. Also seem to catch bigger fish...just my two cents. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1308432,chock,2011-05-18 08:06:00,19,"I hope I did'nt get anybody upset stating that crawlers do not work as good as minnows. I use crawlers regularly and agree there are times when they will work better than minnows. It just seems like we have our best luck with minnows probably because we use them more often. I agree that lindy rigging is better with crawlers. They are tougher and will stay on the hook better, etc. Mike Kansas, do you usually use on plain jig head or do you tip a twister tail?"
