1307274,Knoxabilly,2011-05-15 18:56:00,225,Things they are not proud to admit
1307364,danforth,2011-05-16 01:15:00,117,The Border guards don't always run a background ck. on every one. I live in a border town and cross a lot. If you have a DWI it is a felony in Canada. The guys getting thru are just lucky if they get cked they will be on the way back. I would recommend not wasting your time or money if you have a record. Every year we hear of guys that get cked and turned around even after they have been getting through for years especially during hunting season they seem to ck. more. With the new passport and machine readable document rules requiring we must have one to cross now they can do more cks faster. We will see more guys getting turned around as a result of this. The only way around this is to get a Canadian waiver thru there consultant and from what I hear they are not cheap. If the lodge wont work with you if you get turned around you will lose your deposits ect. I have seen it to many times.

1307891,camp chef,2011-05-17 07:14:00,915,LOL I thought it said OWL too.
1307914,teddi,2011-05-17 08:05:00,349,there is no problem crossing with owls. the problem is catching them and getting them to sit still for the ride up.
1307925,Bill Krejca,2011-05-17 08:29:00,6107,Who?
1308019,Mark R,2011-05-17 11:42:00,1538,When I was in the Air Force. I knew a guy had a pet owl that he kept in the barracks. You come in drunk and that owl would be perched on the water coller and scare the bejesus out of you. He also used to ride around the base on his motorcyle with the owl perched on his shoulder. Funny stuff
