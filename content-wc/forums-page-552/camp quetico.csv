We got burnt on a couple of the lakes - who knows maybe it was just the day, or us? Did good on Bedivire lake, I would try that lake again. If your looking for an adventure, fishing different lakes, it would be a good fit. The down side is you may spend 2 hrs getting into some of the lakes, time that may have been spent fishing if you were on the same lake every day."

It is a very popular resort and if you choose not to utilize their guide service, there are tons of places for them to send you to to get some decent fishing. It is true that most folks travel to the various lakes around the area- where they send you depends on the time of the year and the reports that come in from their guides. The fishing strategies are pretty simple- nothing exotic. Eva Lake where the resort is located has good bass fishing, and great Lake Trout. There are many lakes within a short distance that have incredible smallmouth bass and walleye in them. The cabins are well maintained, and the lodge is nice."

1162847,elmo,2010-01-24 13:59:00,43,I know some guys that have been to the camp a couple of times once to fish and once to bear hunt and did fish also. They said the place was nice and would go back. Have flown out of Eva several times and it looks like a nice lake to fish from the air.
