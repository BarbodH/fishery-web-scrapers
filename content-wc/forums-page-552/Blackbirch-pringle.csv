1163070,ole timer,2010-01-25 10:06:00,34,"Stayed at Pringle about four years ago. Pringle is a walleye factory, but a very uninteresting lake to fish. Both ends are shallow, which makes almost half the lake a waste of water. Center of the lake has large weed beds that are full of walleye, but difficult to fish with anything other than a vertical presentation. Best walleye spot is right by the cabin, in the bay on your left as you look out from the porch. You'll catch more walleye than ever before on Pringle, but there's just no room to explore. Can't comment on pike, don't fish for them.MLO is a topnotch operation.OT"

Dad and I caught a number of pike from the low 30"" to 40"" plus - all while walleye fishing. Pringle does have a few spots that aren't easy to find and that do require some exploration. Took the two of us all 3 years to cover them all - at least all that the two of us could find. Blackbirch has far more water. You can access another lake (forget the name right now)via an easy channel navigation. We too had terrible weather the year we fished there (June 2008) and the fishing was not ""easy"". We were the second group in that year and the fish were in the post-spawn doldrum (our evaluation anyway). I'm sure the lake can be fantastic, but for us it was a fair amount of work to get on them. Still a great trip. Best pike was in the mid-40"" range - not many snakes or ""mid"" size fish. MLO runs the BEST all around operation I've ever seen. Cabins, planes, etc. are better than anywhere I've been. Don and Annette run a top-notch service - you can't go wrong with them. NO sometimes uses Don Elliot's charter flying to get you in and out of the lake (that's good). One thing I've found is that outfitters who run their own charters have fewer hassles when it comes to getting in and out in a timely manner. NO's cabins (been at two) are adequate but not as nice as MLO's. Overall, I'd have to give Pringle the nod over Blackbirch for accomodations, service and fishing - but if Blackbirch had been as good as it can be it may be a tougher decision (for fishing anyway). I think you'd be happy with either lake or outfitter.[email protected] if you'd like to discuss it further."
