I liked the coat as well but already had a columbia rain jacket so that is what I used. I would like to purchase the pro-qualifier jacket soon."
1164116,Steve Ediger,2010-01-28 12:07:00,97,"I have always wanted a Guidewear Jacket but thought them to be a little pricey. This clearance sale was just what I was waiting for! Got a great deal on a some great rainwear. I only ordered a jacket as I bought a new set of bibs last spring. I have a couple of questions for anyone who may be able to help me. My jacket (parka length) has three clips on the inside, in the back, along the drawstring line that are sewn into the jacket with canvas straps. What are these for? Also on the inside, on both sides of the jacket near the zipper are two small three sided pockets with a strip of velcro inside. What are these?My wife and I have been scratching our heads on these two features and can't figure it out unless they have something to do with the Guidewear bibs.Please help us out, it's driving us crazy.Steve"
1164145,Pezman38,2010-01-28 14:25:00,3196,Are you guys finding the right sizes available? I looked through all the Guidewear cabelas had and if it was onsale a large didn't exist. Perhaps they are gone now but thought this would be a good gift for my dad.
1164186,Get Fish,2010-01-28 16:21:00,7,"Steve, The clips are for attaching the XCS belt (back brace/ support) to the inside of the parka and the pockets are what they call the belt garages for sticking the ends of the support belt when not in use. Go online and go to the guidewear section and click on the video and they will show you how it works. Also Cabelas has recently put that $20 belt in the clearance section for $0.88 in all sizes. I'm going to pick up a few just to have and use around the house and in the yard as regular support when lifting heavy items.cstalzer, sizes are getting limited at this point. WhenI ordered mine weeks ago, the guy I spoke to on the phone was saying they were low in stock and if they are out of a particular size they don't even show it in the drop-down bax."
1164608,Guest,2010-01-30 09:38:00,0,insulated guide wear 100 thumbs up after wearing them I'd paid more for them there that good This fall running down the river at about 38 mph and -7 celcius for about 8 miles arrived at my spot toasty warm and fished all day in 20 k winds and did not feel worn out at the end of the day I don't mind spending money for something of that quality the only problem is i should have bought a pair 20 yrs ago
1164791,Steve Ediger,2010-01-31 08:33:00,97,Get FishThanks for the info. I don't know if I will use it but for $.88 how can you go wrong!Steve
1158491,northernbite,2010-01-07 08:13:00,1186,"Yes, If it is the same as my Guidewear.Paul"
1158495,pike50plus,2010-01-07 08:29:00,584,"I always spray the seems and zipper area of any suit I've had with campdry or some other water repellant spray just to really seal those area, seems to work pretty good any redo it here and there? Go Buckeyes!"
1158509,Seanik,2010-01-07 09:16:00,218,"Ohiojmj, After reading your post I inspected my new CGW carefully, especially the storm flaps over the front parka zipper and the bibs front and leg zippers. All of the zippers are substancial and protected by a double storm flap made of the same material as the rainsuit and secured by heavy duty velcro. It looks to be extremely waterproof. It is possible that the rainsuit you purchased is not the same model as the ones now being sold. Seanik"
1158563,ohiojmj,2010-01-07 12:25:00,1262,"There is definitely a difference between Cabelas GW and GW SPORT. If I had a double storm flap, I wouldn't be skeptical. The original price tag on the parka and bib was $259 and $249 so I was surprised to see the important zippers covered with two thin ribbons with a tiny gap at the middle. These are not ""waterproof"" zippers either as I tested with a bowl of water and some came through. the more I talk, the more i think I may send them back, even though it is GW."
1159041,Guest,2010-01-09 09:52:00,0,"I brought two sets of Toggs to LS last year and left the Guide Wear at home in an attempt to save some space in my dry bag. Big mistake! We ran into big weather the week after the tornado in the Ear Falls area. My Toggs were soaked through within 15 minutes on multiple days. My buddies had their Guide Wear on and were bone dry. Toggs are light weight, pack well and great for walking through a dew laden field. Any ""real"" weather and I would go with CGW. Once bitten... -DJ"
1159089,Steve of Madison,2010-01-09 15:31:00,230,"AMEN... BROTHER!!! You get what you pay for, and sometime's when you get it on sale even better!!! A good rain suit is worth it's space and weight. We aren't afraid to spend hundreds on rods and reels, yet some guys will skimp on something so basic that can make or break your trip. If you buy Cabella's Guide Wear, Gander H20 Guide Series or BPS all are very good and will keep you hi and dry."
1159546,Get Fish,2010-01-11 19:22:00,7,"Got my CGW today, They are awesome!!!!!!!As I read back over this thread I see a few different descriptions of the CGW. The ones I ordered is the one with the gutter system, xcs belt system, waterproof zippers all over, etc.... small tight flaps at front zipper on parka. This is the one with the video showing its waterproof protection. I went back to Cabelas website and see they have two CGW labeled almost identicaly, except parka and jacket is transposed in the item name. They look very similar except front flap and upper pockets that close by velcro. One is on sale and the other is not; and don't offer a lot of the other features mentioned above.Did some more comparisons and found a 3rd guidewear....this one is labled as CGW Systems Parka and has a zip out windstopper liner included with the parka, bibs are different in style and are more like pants with suspenders. Also they have a 4th GW new for this year a redesigned CGW called the X300... it has a few improvements.Here are a few pics:"
1159800,ohiojmj,2010-01-12 18:06:00,1262,"While I admit to paying pennies on the dollar for rain gear, I was assuming that all GW, including GW SPORT variety, was proven, tested, robust, dependable, and freaking dry. Cabelas does have several flavors of GW, some seem to have much better features, especially at the critical front zipper ont he parka. For $59 for a parka and $49 for bibs, I thought it was worth a try. I may have the wife hit me with the garden hose in the garage soon to end the debate."
1163828,Jigger1,2010-01-27 13:40:00,234,"I'm going to be purchasing new rain gear this season and going into it was predetermined that I would be wearing Cabela's X300 Guidewear. That was however until I went to Cabela's and tried it on, the gear appears to be overly stiff and as a result I walked out not making the purchase. Most all of my gear is from Cabela's and I own a Guideshield jacket I just love. However since, I received a gift card to Bass Pro and went into the store and tried on their Pro Qualifier series. It was much more comfortable right off the hook and from all indications is a quality product that will get the job done and leave me satisfied with my purchase. I also understand they have a new 100 mph line but don't know that I need it. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated."
1163848,camp chef,2010-01-27 14:36:00,915,Go back to Cabela's and buy the Guidewear...I'm just sayin'
1158275,Seanik,2010-01-06 10:32:00,218,"After many years of getting wet from cheap rainsuits while on Canadian fishing trips, I finally bought a quality gore-tex rainsuit. I did search this forum and found the Cabelas guide wear was mostly recommended by posters. I also looked at Bass Pro Shops 100 mph rainsuit but no deals and full price as of now. Cabelas has the screaming deal, I got the bibs and parka for 248.85 shipped, regular price was about 410.00 + shipping. The rainsuit seems a bit bulky compared to the cheapee's but it will replace a jacket and heavy shirts I normally take, order it oversized so I can wear fleece under it. I can also wear it on the fly in to cut down on the 100 lb weight limit and stuff the large pockets with gear. I called Cabelas to order and did a bit of dealing to get the good price. If you are interested in a gore-tex rainsuit, the sale is on , probably will be full price in the Spring. Seanik"
1158282,IRISHATTACK,2010-01-06 10:58:00,44,"I bought H2O bibs from Gander Mountain for about 90.00. I bought two pairs of frogg toggs from Basspro for 50.00. I kept one frogg tog suit new and only use the jacket. I have a ton a mobility in them and the price was well worth it. I too looked at the Cabelas suits, but very high dollar and seems stiff. Just my thougths, hope it works well."
1158284,Juls,2010-01-06 11:12:00,13414,"Well done Seanick! That's a GREAT price on that suit.You will be extremely happy with it. And, if anything ever goes wrong with it, Cabelas will treat you right. I have both the CGW and the BPS 100, and it's the CGW that I grab most often. Juls"
1158297,Get Fish,2010-01-06 12:16:00,7,"Which did you get the insulated, thinsulate, or the uninsulated? Which is better? I'm curious how well they keep you warm? and how does the uninsulated feel in cold weather? can you use the uninsulated and just add a fleece under it when out in those low temps to keep warm? Not trying to hijack, just curious... because I have some gift cards burning a hole in my pocket!Thanks!Ken"
1158305,Seanik,2010-01-06 12:49:00,218,"Ken, I got the uninsulated rainsuit a size larger so I can wear fleece underneath on cold days. I tried it outside today with fleece, 26 degress and it seem to be warm and toasty. I was concerned that the insulated rainsuit would be too warn for July and August rainy days. I have a short inseam and got the regular length bibs, they are a tad long but will be fine, especially while sitting when they tend to ride up a bit on the leg. The parka has more than ample room in the shoulder area so movement isn't hindered a bit. I am definitely liking the CGW. Seanik"
1158354,Get Fish,2010-01-06 16:27:00,7,Thanks Seanik! I'm going to place my order now before they are out of my size.
1158376,retire55,2010-01-06 17:53:00,1029,"I've been wearing the uninsulated CGW (bibs and parka) since 2005 on fishing trips to north western Quebec for trout and walleye. Trips have been as early as the second week of May and as late as the third week of September. Regardless the time of year of these trips, I was always been comfortable and DRY in the CGW. As Seanik has posted, just wear some fleece to keep you warm in colder weather."
1158396,SimilarIsland,2010-01-06 19:12:00,121,Picked up some CGW uninsulated bibs for my son today on their clearance rack for $109.
1158442,Get Fish,2010-01-07 04:40:00,7,Placed my order last night and should get it in a few days. I will post once it arrives and what my impressions are. Thanks Seanik for responding back.
1158460,ohiojmj,2010-01-07 06:14:00,1262,"I picked up Cabelas Guidewear ""Sport"" parka and bibs a few weeks ago from Cabelas. The set was $110, amazing. It may still be on sale with differing prices for various sizes and colors. However, the front zipper on the parka and the zippers down the sides of the bibs do not have a storm flap! The thin cover over the zipper is split down the middle. Just wondering if this can really stop rain? Is Cabelas Guidewear Sport proven to be waterproof? For the price, I will test in spring and send back if I get hosed."
