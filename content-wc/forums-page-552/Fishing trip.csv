1162402,toolboy,2010-01-22 18:50:00,515,My family is looking into a fishing trip in August. Right now we are looking at the Minaki area. I am wondering how the fishing is this time of year in the Winnepeg River system. Also considering Halley's Resort on the English River system. Any help and suggestions would be great.

The trips have been nothing short of great, even in late August. The accommodations, equipment, and their attention to details are very good. They are new owners to this camp and know how to treat people in a vacation atmosphere.They also know what they are doing on the lakes and in the woods. Caught good numbers of both walleye & Northerns. Check out the website atBracelakeoutfitters.com Then give them a call, You won't be disappointed. Give me a PM if your interested in more info & Pics.Best of luck.Kindest Regards,Rob"

You park at your cabin.http://www.paradisecoveminaki.com search on YOUTUBE also Another good suggestion is ""Big North"" It is a drive to camp but your gear will be brought to your cabin by ATV. Cabins are a bit more rustic than Paradise Cove but still very nice http://www.bignorthlodge.com/ If you search MINAKI on this site I am sure you will find several good suggested sites. You can get a lot of hot fishing tips from guys on this site. Dave from Tennessee stays at Birch Island and likes it, but it is on an island. Check out http://www.ontariotowns.net/Minaki/"
