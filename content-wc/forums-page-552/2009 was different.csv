1161087,Babamel2,2010-01-18 08:01:00,414,"This past year the fishing was different. It was difficult to catch them in the usual locations, and we had to adapt to other presentations. Was this typical for you too? If so, what did you do that worked? for us, once we added spinners we found fish that were active."
1161105,Steve of Madison,2010-01-18 08:54:00,230,"2009 was different. Colder than normal temps, and water temps. Weed lines were not as defined and the emergent weeds were only 2-4 ft high in 10-12 ft of water. On LS the water levels were rising from an abundance of rainfall and unstable weather patterns all summer leading up to July.What did that mean for fisherman? Normal patterns and tactics worked only occasionally, you had to adapt and make changes not only to find fish but get them to bite when you did find them.My usual spots were SLOW, I had to make changes, not only in location but also depth and presentation. I found fish in out of the way bays, backwater areas if you wish. Where the water was warmer and the emergent weed growth was evident. I slowed down my presentation, I slip bobbered, three way rigged, and drifted really slow. I also found that if I stayed along soft shorelines with weeds the fish were there. If I was along rocky shorelines, no fish. Lastly, if I jigged the fish were smaller, if I backtrolled worm rigs the size went up, if I slib bobbered with either a minnow or worm they got bigger again. I am interested to hear some of the other guys thoughts.That's why it's called fishing, not catching!"
1161118,Obabikon,2010-01-18 09:15:00,2370,"2009 was the best fishing year I've ever seen in my 28 years on lake of the woods. Huge fish, lots of fish, all species of fish... Typically, we fished them in the same spots as always, it just wasn't at the same time. Instead of the 3rd week in June, it was the 2nd week in July... instead of the End of August it was the beginning of September. The spots and patterns were all the same, just at different times."
1161139,Glenman12,2010-01-18 10:38:00,762,"We go up the 2nd week of June every year and this year was the best walleye fishing we've in I dont know how long..there were no trophies caught (the biggest for our group was 26"") but we had an amazing number of fish in the 19-22"" range with several over that..we fished the same spots with the same presentations..the biggest problem we had was getting fish under 18"" to bring home...and it was pretty much the same thing with the smallies..our group caught dozens of them in the 18-21"" range..it was just crazy and I hope this year is a repeat.."
1161201,fishanytime,2010-01-18 15:04:00,63,"We fished LOTW once a month all spring into fall, over 40 days and found the fishing patterns to be different each time we fished. The best walleye fishing was in shallow water along weedlines or in 30 plus feet on humps or some days big flats. Trolling shad raps along week edges worked the best when the eyes were there. One day in the fall I tried 14 different locations while jigging in 7 to 47 feet of water. Finually found the best concentration on top of a 36 foot hump. We would catch one of two in several places but that would be it. One day jigging they wouldn't touch leeches but hit on minnows as soon as I switched. We could also find a few backtrolling rigs along inlands with some weeks, enough for lunch but that was about it. We did do well mid summer with light downriggers dragging shad raps in 30 plus feet of water on days we couldn't catch them jigging. You had to bump the bottom a few times and know where the rock piles were. All in all a very different year in the yellowgirl and west areas on LOTW's. Summer didn't come until Sept. except for one week in June. The wind blew out of several different directions some days and wet and cold were normal conditions. My IFS rig on my lund paid for itself as it always does in Canada. fishanytime"

1161231,Pooch,2010-01-18 16:32:00,4619,"I have to agree. I won't miss 2009! Tough year farming and fishing in Canada was slower than I've experienced in many years.We enjoy finding fish and we did a lot of fish hunting and spent much ""think time"" in the cabin at night. Amazing how much fishing knowledge a group contains when put to the test.Canada (and Illinois!) was wet and cold every trip except September! Shorts and t-shirts in September and two sweatshirts plus rain-suit in June, July and August! Go figure.It was rare to pick up any fish on our usual summer spots. No prevailing winds to accumulate fish for more than a day or so. We only had a couple days when ""you could do no wrong"". We also caught walleye where we would never have found fish any other year. No ""big"" fish in 2009.Lac Seul in early September was better than last year for one group. With good numbers of walleye and many smallies on jigs.Did well Lake trout fishing, which makes sense. I think....Learned (and relearned) a lot last year so it was worth it. Of course, as fishermen we are an eternally optimistic bunch. Now looking forward to the 2010 season as much as the rest of you.Pooch"
1161237,luv2fishcanada,2010-01-18 17:02:00,41,"Been going to Gullrock since I was 14 in 1980. I always go up the first or second week of June. I found this year was tough like most others that went up early due to the late spring. I've always fished crawlers and have never bought a minnow until this year (sorry minnowman). This year if you wanted to boat fish minnows were required. Minnows easily outfished crawlers 6-1. Unlike years in the past also it seamed like the bite was slow at times instead of being steady all day long. When they got hungry the bite was as good as always. No big females this year, but as always Gullrock produced many fish over 22 inches. 09 was differenct but still better than working 52 weeks a year. Only good thing about the late spring was the northern bite was very good."
1161256,Bill Krejca,2010-01-18 17:56:00,6107,"We had September weather in mid-July, and July weather in mid-September. O'Sullivan Lake was very windy almost every day and quite cool in July. The walleyes were deep, for the most part, few weeds were evident, caught lake trout while walleye fishing in 25-30 fow, not much action shallow. Water temp was around 59 degrees. The normally good fall crappie fishing at LOW on the east end was difficult, as they were not yet in the congregated deep water. Found them in Obabikon, somewhat shallower than normal. They were just starting to hit on the east end of the lake the last day we fished. Warm days with little wind resulted in 71 degree water temp. My hope is for a more normal weather situation for this year! Maybe it doesn't matter, however, as my addiction for the north woods is stronger than any stringer count. Bill Krejca"
1161296,phishfearme,2010-01-18 20:18:00,1242,oh yeah - this past year was definitly unique - see my report about the weather and it's impacts at:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...ght=wettlaufer phish
1161360,Larry Mac,2010-01-19 06:57:00,530,"We fished the same lake as Glenman12 the 3rd week of June. His report is very accurate, we have never fished that lake before and had no problem in the least catching fish. My son and I fished together and our best Smallmouth day was 89 and best walleye day was just under 100. Now here is the other side of the coin, we went to our regular August lake and the fish were scattered and not in our regular (Honey Holes) spots. We have fished this lake for many years and are very familiar with the spots and techniques. Of course we caught plenty of fish, after all (It's Canada EH') but not the numbers we usually catch and certainly not in the regular locations. We are looking forward to our trips this year. Have a great year.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1161390,Mike Kansas,2010-01-19 08:39:00,1463,"Our first trip to Lac Seul was in early June and the weather made the fishing tough. We had our best luck in very shallow water with small jigs always fishing the windy shores. Our normal spots produced about 50% of the norm. Overall the fishing on the trip was less than average based on our past trips during the same time and at the same place. In July we went back to Lac Sul and fished out of Lost Island Lodge and had the best week I have ever seen in 20+ years on Lac Seul. We literally caught a lot of Walleye every day and there were not many times that the action was slow. We caught a lot of 25+ fish and two over 29"". All our fish came on jigs with either minnows or crawlers with minnows leading the way. The weather was much nicer and the water temps were much warmer than our June trip and we were able to fish some deeper water. I'm sure that was the main difference. Good luck, Mike Kansas"
1161395,lcwhit,2010-01-19 08:50:00,104,"in the last 5 years, we've gone to lac seul 4 times. 2 years of scorching heat, skipped a year and then 2 years of cold wind and rain. needless to say, walleye fishing has been poor for us. my brother and brother in law have caught a lot of big pike. adding insult to injury, we all went to the expense of getting passports for last year and got our van tossed on a friday night at i falls. i thought initially that it was because we were in a van with no rear seat windows, but came to realize that they were tossing everyone in the line in order to collect duties i guess. we were clean on smokes and beer and they let us go on about 45 minutes after we initially got in line. very humiliating experience. well, we did our planning meeting at christmas and decided to go to kentucky lake this year. we may go back to lac seul on an every other or every third year basis. i'd sure like to get on the walleye like we did back in 2000-2004."
1161401,Guest,2010-01-19 08:57:00,0,"I fished the week of May 30-June 6, and the week of July 11-17. Both weeks the water levels were the highest I'd seen. The first week was cold and wet. So cold we never bothered unpacking our cooler at the end of the day, just left it on the porch. The walleye fishing was tough, but we spent a lot of time fishing the mouths of two rivers, where we caught quite a few 22-26"" walleye, some decent sized pike and lots of lake trout up to 12lb. I kept one 4 lb laker to bring home for a friend, and he spit up 14 small minnows and two 4"" perch. Crawlers and leeches caught almost nothing, but a jig with a white twister tipped with a minnow was a killer. July 11-17, we had a couple fairly nice weather days early, but it got colder, windier and wetter as the week went along. We had a tough time finding numbers, but had a good time trying many new places, and found some good new spots. We again caught good numbers of 22-26"" walleye, and one 27-1/2"". A jig with a crawler out caught anything else by a large margin. Overall, we felt our fishing ranked somewhere in the lower half of all our trips. Numbers were not great, but the percentage of bigger fish was higher than normal. Catching lakers in shallow water was a riot. Weather-wise, they were two of the toughest trips I recall, and a couple days were among the most miserable I've ever fished in. It would have to get a whole lot worse, because we're counting the days until we go again."
1161530,joeman79,2010-01-19 18:21:00,417,"after getting all pumped up by Mike about fishing out of Lost Island Lodge, and how great the fishing was!! We arrived to COLD Wet and Windy Lac Seul. Fishing was SLOW 3 of the days we wee there. Had to wear Long Underwear and Raingear 3 of the 5 days fishing. But That was not Mikes fault or LIL fault, but I wanted to rib him about it anyways. We still had a fantastic time and caught plenty of fish. We loved Shane and Sam and Basil and rebooked same week for this summer. Can't wait to go. But I sure hope it is warmer than last summer. HI MIKE!!!! If we could just control the weather!!! Hope you have a great summer Mike and al WC'ers"

1162633,kgeary,2010-01-23 16:00:00,88,"The foot of snow we received on May 14 was a dead give away on what was to come. The biggest difference was the unending rain we had all summer. fish were definitely on different spots at different times than previous years. Lots of big walleye near the spawning areas until early June. Then they moved to the usual summer haunts. But as the water rose they started spreading out more than usual. which wasn't a bad thing. Just made more structures productive. My daughter Seanna got a big fat 32 incher in late July. Throughout the summer many guests reported the best fishing of their lives. As the water kept rising into September we found fish reverting to early June like situations. Had a few weeks in September catching tons of fish and big fish in 4-6 feet of water. One day stands out. I was fishing with some fine folks from Ohio and at 3 oclock the dad said ""okay thats 500"" I realized we were catching them 3 at a time most of the day and the majority were over 20 inches. They went on and on about it being the best day ever etc etc, didn't get any arguments from me. what was a bit strange was how long the big walleye stayed on the staging grounds for the whitefish spawn. In fact I'm still catching walleye and whitefish icefishing in those areas last weekend. I think that many people have difficulty locating fish in years like 2009 ( 2004 was another strange yr). When weather patterns change, late ice out, early ice out etc. people often want the fish to be in the same place they were last year or the year before etc. this is seldom true. It is more important to go by natures calendar rather than the calendar on your wall. when I say natures calendar I'm refering to when the yello butterflies hatch, shiners spawn, dragon flies hatch etc. Tune into this and you can usually locate fish on any lake in any year. other than the weather ( ie no summer) I really enjoyed 2009 What about this winter. we have about 4 inches of snow on the ground and it's raining today.?????? You can read about the summer of 09 in more detail with lots of photos on our blog at.http://anglerskingdom.blogspot.com/ or I have several articles some explaining natures calendar in the articles sections on my website.http://www.anglerskingdom.com/"
1163624,Babamel2,2010-01-26 20:45:00,414,"thanks for all the replies. your comments helped me to finally define the pattern we used that gave the best luck last summer. I guess I am a slow learner. It was the North shore of smaller lakes, shallow water, near weed beds with a slow troll with small silver spinners. I had overlooked the fact that it was all a north shore on smaller lakes."
1163631,kgeary,2010-01-26 21:15:00,88,"The north shore warms first. critical in drawing minnows etc to shallow water in June or even in september if that is where they happen to be. also promotes hatches etc. clay with weeds is more for hatches. if fishing hatches the silver blades would work better. somehow looks like a mayfly coming to the surface also big walleye will be cruising for whitefish who are eating the hatch sand and weeds more for perch etc. wind blowing in to is another especially if they are feeding primarily on minnows. familiar patterns in June. most people try to avoid the may fly hatch in fact it can be the best time of year. concentrate on mud flats, depth doesn't matter that much. it may take four or five days but eventually they will just get tired of eating. Nungesser is a large lake and seems to be seperated into 4 sections when it comes to the mayflies. when they get ""full"" in one section behind camp we simply fish in front of camp that section seems to be on a different schedule then we move down the lake etc. Have had some awesome fishing trolling large cranks whitefish colors and pattern People don't think about how much large walleye like eating whitefish. when the whitefish are eating mayflies off the surface they make a pretty enticing target for a big walleye. Big walleye really like eating little walleye as well. its' not always an pike that grabs your 15 inch walleye when your realing it in. when one lets go take a good look at your walleye when you bring it in. you can tell by the bite marks a pike makes more scratches, a walleye fewer deeper holes. fishing? of course! kg"
1161257,labsrus,2010-01-18 17:57:00,557,"Went on two different trips to Canada this year. A family Walleye trip to a place we have been going for many years. A fly in trip for big Pike was made that was great. The family trip was a little slow this year compared to most years. We really had to work to catch enough fish for a couple of meals. The fly in way great, we caught tons of fish. mostly Pike but we did get a few walleyes"
