1161282,elway12,2010-01-18 19:33:00,335,"Went for our 2nd trip ever to Wildewood in July 09. It was COLD & WET(atleast for July). People said it was the wettest summer in a long while. Still caught bunches of fish - though slow at times. Caught a nice 17 pound laker(see my profile pics) and a couple of smaller 8-10's pounders jigging. Walleyes were nice, fat and caught many in the 21-24 inch range. Not too many snakes largest was 35in. Had a great time as usual even though it only got above 60 one time the last day in camp Planning on going again around that same time in 2010."

Watched him and his grand daughter net a nice trout in front of the WW camp. We made three trips last year to savant and it was cold and for the most part slow during the summer, but went back in September to observe the MNR test net the lake and it was t-shirt weather. Contact me through WC with your email and I'll send you a few MNR pictures. Cat Track, Cliff & Roma's and Wildewood seemed to be busy all summer. MNR netted a 32"" walleye very close to one of my favorite spots. Don't ask so I won't have to lie to you.....Pooch"
