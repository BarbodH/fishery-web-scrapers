1161658,lonewolf73,2010-01-20 07:09:00,17,Anyone out there have any information regarding Sowden Lake? I know it it part of the English River system but that is about it. Has anyone fished it recently? Possibly planning a trip to the area in early August.Any help or information would be greatly appreciated!

I haven't fished the Ignace area so cann't tell you anything about the fishing. I like the choice of 3 species-better shot of something biting than a 2 specie lake. Good luck and let us know if you are going and how you did.Gary"

Walleyes were caught on jigs and trolling all with minnows. The lake can get rough when the wind blows down the lake but there is bays to go to to fish. There also is 2 other lakes you can boat to but we did not do so good in them. But we were only there a week. Bigest walleye was 25 inches. Northerns around 25 to 27 inches for us. I would go back and give it another try sometime. Cabins are all notty pine and very nice and well kept. Take at least a 16 foot boat because of the waves on windy days. Docks are just down a small hill to lake about 50 yards. The old guy that runs the camp will help you on where to go he did for us. No outlets in cabins all by generator if you need to charge your battery bring a geny with you. Watch for rocks in the other lakes we hit a bar going into the second lake at the mouth. Hope this helps TIGHT LINES GUYS.
1162646,drlee,2010-01-23 16:42:00,409,Have you looked at the Press Lake website? Just google Press Lake Camp and you will be quickly directed. Its in the same area as Sowden and may have some advantages for you to consider. I have fished it for 2 weeks each of the last 3 years and will return in mid-late July in 2010. More info if you have any interest.
