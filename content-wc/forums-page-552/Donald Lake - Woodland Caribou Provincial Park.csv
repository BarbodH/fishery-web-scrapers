No lodges that I recall, but a scattering of private cabins, maybe 4 or 5. We saw almost no one else, except a few canoeists coming thru on one or two week paddles. Are you canoeing or staying at one of the cabins?"
1162291,LoDo,2010-01-22 10:19:00,721,A family friend owns a portion of the 4-5 cabin resort / lodge on Donald. I've seen pictures and it looks great! What time of year did you go? How was the fishing? We will have boats that are provided by the cabin owners.The past few years I've been to Lac Seul and the fishing was great!
