1160122,Guest,2010-01-14 07:52:00,0,I can't bring minnows into minnesota or wisconsin from canada. I guess they want their taxes also.
1160131,Obabikon,2010-01-14 08:15:00,2370,"Both sides are equally childish. However, bringing live bait is proven than it can damage lakes. So, that's a logical ban."
1161556,walleyeduran,2010-01-19 19:25:00,286,"V-Gord, it is interesting that you bring up the orange example. Did you know that 90% of the leaches sold in Canada are actually caught in the U.S. (it is funny how you can not bring leaches into Canada fron the united states because they may have a harmful effect on the, OH OH WAIT, the leaches are from the united states). Not to start a argument, but both of our countries have a very good history of taking advantage of what they think is a easy BUCK. Duran"
1161571,Obabikon,2010-01-19 20:17:00,2370,"There's also a difference in commercial transport of leeches that are tested, and Billy Bob bringing across a bag of leeches to go fishin'."
1161583,v-bay gord,2010-01-19 21:08:00,3168,My understanding of your leech example is that in 1999 Ontario brought in a non-commercial restriction on importation of live leeches. In 2005 this was extended to the commercial importation of leeches as well. So I believe that for the last 4 years your interesting fact is no longer factual. Correct me if I'm wrong but that is the reason that all bait dealers in this area trap or buy their leeches from local sources.
1161665,JDP,2010-01-20 07:17:00,1457,I believe you are exactly right-on V-Bay Gord!
1161868,GNO,2010-01-20 18:15:00,153,V-bay is correct
1162461,alanexpup,2010-01-22 22:32:00,278,i guess this is just another way of saying yankee stay home!
1162654,GNO,2010-01-23 17:02:00,153,"Are you talking about the new HST tax or the bait issue that this thread has turned into? The new tax will actuall save most visitors who are taking a package, which I would assume is teh majority of the visitors. The bait issue on the other hand, I believe is pretty universal no matter what side of the border you are from. The simplest solution to the bait issue is use Gulp, it works just as good most of the time."
1159416,v-bay gord,2010-01-11 09:08:00,3168,"My point, which you did not understand, was that there is no guarantee that the reciept you have matches the bait you wish to bring along. It is just a piece of paper. Sorry for my contrary tone, but the health of our fisheries is more important than your feelings, your tourist $, or your skewed opinion. My vested interest is in having great bodies of water now, and into the future. I'm not willing to let that go because you are unwilling to buy a few dozen minnows in Ontario."
1159419,Esoxchaser,2010-01-11 09:16:00,1576,"How would they know the Ontario receipt matches the bait? The entire argument is flawed, barring the marking of bait when tested. Both jurisdictions require VHS testing of bait. Either receipt would prove the bait was tested and found VHS free. The only difference is that Ontario can't tax the US bought bait."
1159440,v-bay gord,2010-01-11 11:19:00,3168,"What guarantees that the receipt matches the bait you wish to bring into the country? Perhaps you like to trap your own or you have a buddy that does. Perhaps you changed the water several times from sources containing disease or invasive species. If, on the other hand, you cannot bring bait across the border then the receipt you show in Ontario will likely mean the bait is from Ontario waters. It also means the bait can be traced back to the local dealer your receipts says you bought it from. The connection you draw to the taxation question is flawed......."
1159457,troutaholic,2010-01-11 13:19:00,827,"In a nutshell: - Both Receipts state that the bait is VHS-Free - Both Receipts can be traced back to the Original Bait Store (If there is no ""Switcheroo tactics""). The ONLY Difference is that: - There is no Canadian taxes on the Michigan receipt Therefore, if the issue is to keep the waters ""Clean and bug-free"", the MI receipt meets that criteria. Unfortunately, Canada refuses to honor MI receipts. Why? Esox is stating that it is because they want the extra tax dollars AND NOT to keep the waters ""Clean and bug-free"" as they claim. If the ultimate reason was for this purpose, the rule should be that "" ALL bait must be certified as VHS-Free and traceable back to the original supplier of said bait. I won't even go into the nightcrawler ""double-standard"" by Canada. I have the same argument on the Rainy lake between Minnesota and Canada, so I do have some learned knowledge on the subject."
1159467,v-bay gord,2010-01-11 14:19:00,3168,"My point is that live bait crossing an international border could have it's origins anywhere, regardless of what scrap of paper you present to say otherwise. A border official has no way to verify that this is the same bait you claim to have purchased. It could be bait you trapped in your brother-in-laws goby infested pond. The fact that you are stopped at the border from bringing in live bait eliminates this question. As far as whether the bait you have with your Ontario receipt being legit is a parallel but different issue. The origin of that bait will be Ontario waters. As far as being traceable, I would say it is much easier for a local CO to verify with a local bait store whether there may be some issue or not. The local CO is not going to start investigating a bait shop in another country. The bottom line is that this is a natural resources issue, not a tax one. If you prefer to believe the conspiracy theory then just remember that it is a different country and you need to expect to pay the appropriate taxes. By the way, there is no double standard by Canada on nightcrawlers. They just expect them to be brought into the country in artificial bedding. Even if they originate in Canada, how they are imported into the US is a matter for the US, not Canada."
1159477,Esoxchaser,2010-01-11 15:20:00,1576,"I am not referring to being stopped while driving across the border, I am talking about fishing on border waters. The St Clair system (which connects lakes Huron and Erie) already has VHS in it, so the whole VHS certification thing, checking boats upon those very busy waters is merely an exercise in checking tax stamps. People used to buy licenses for both Ontario and MI and simply follow the fish. It was never uncommon to be back and forth across the border 6 times a day in the rivers. So common that the Detroit to port Huron areas were the nations biggest users of the I-68 and OARS border programs. Checking local website bulletin boards, you would find that the number of people buying Ontario licenses and getting their I-68's has dropped off dramatically. I think one could easily figure that the ridiculous bait requirement is costing Ontario more in unsold fishing license revenue than it could ever make them in sales taxes, while accomplishing nothing else but assuring that only Ontario provided VHS free bait is used in waters already infected with VHS.Unfortunately the small businessman along the rivers and lake suffer as well, as tournaments are moved to the MI side, and the restaurants and other businesses see a downturn in traffic from across the water. I have spelled it out repeatedly and as succinctly as I am capable. So I wish you the best for the upcoming season, and hope you understand what I am trying to say."
1159499,v-bay gord,2010-01-11 16:25:00,3168,"Esoxchaser, o.k., now I get your drift. The border water issue is one that I am not familiar with. I can see the frustration if bait bought on one side of the water body was not allowed on the other side. The bottom line is the bait is being used in the same water regardless of it's nationality. My concern was on bait being transported to different water bodies......thanks for clearing up your position for me. It sort of falls into the same category of me buying an orange that originates in the U.S. and not being able to drive it back across the border without being confiscated...makes about as much sense. That's government for you. Catch a big one in 2010!"
1159731,Superfluke,2010-01-12 13:41:00,13,"Over the past few years going into fly-in outpost camps where you pay a flat amount for the trip (flight, use of camp, boats, camp equipment, cabin, etc.), we have been paying a 5.5 or 6% tax on top of the flat amount trip cost charged by the outfitter. Now, as I understand it, for 2010 we are going to pay the ""harmonized 13%. Can anyone speak to the details on what portion of this is refundable and any revised procedures to pursue this refund? Thanks."
1159771,GNO,2010-01-12 16:04:00,153,"You are entitled to 1/2 of the 13% back, so you will only be paying 6.5% in the end. Your outfitter can rebate this directly back to you if they want. It is a little more paperwork on there end, but worth it for customer satisfaction. If they do not do this, you will need to apply for it back like the GST rebate and wait and hope you filled the paperwork out correctly."
1159883,troutaholic,2010-01-13 07:07:00,827,That's government for you. Says it all
1159144,Muskie Bob,2010-01-09 22:28:00,45,"GNO,Interesting that your business will not be affected. The rumors I heard last year was that resort business (around Eagle lake and surronding area) was down at least 30% from previous year.I'm sure a lot has to do with the high cost of gas and job situations in the United States.my visit.......2 weeks......400 per week housekeeping cabin, 6 gals gas per day, 30 gals for truckYou are right about the increase being small. I figured it would cost me about an additional $54 for 2 weeks. that's figuring gas to be around $4 per gallon in Ontario. That comes out to be around 6% increase.As to 13% increase in gas, we have that type of increase on a weekly basis....ugh....Although the cost of gas is probably the biggest increase, it seems like every year for the last few years Ontario prices have kept going up. I wonder how much my cost has gone up over the last 5 years.Basically, the small increases each year has been adding up. That, along with the price of gas, makes me feel I can get more for my money in the US. Oh, I'll probably come to Ontario. However, I feel it is best to see how high the price of gas goes. If it goes over 3.50 per gallon, I'll probably consider staying in the United States, where prices are going up too..... Anyway, you are right about the increase being small.Good luck on your business."
1159164,SimilarIsland,2010-01-10 06:42:00,121,Will this effect gas brought into Canada from the US? Maybe only if they get you for duty at the border?
1159165,Esoxchaser,2010-01-10 06:44:00,1576,"Living along the Canadian US border all I can say is more taxes in Ontario is no suprise, GST was just a warm up.. I used to buy an Ontario and MI fishing license every year. but Ontaro keeps making it clear they don't want us there. They ship bait to MI, crawlers, minnows etc..then when we head across the river to Canada to fish they require that we buy our bait in Canada.They contend that is because they are afraid of the spread of VHS, but MI already requires minnows to be certified VHS free, and the fisherman has to have a reciept stating so. Minnows caught in the river for use in the river obviously don't pay attention to the border. It's all just an Ontario money grab, that wastes at least 1/2 hour of every fishing trip. Add to that the incessant checking of MI fishermen by the MNR to enforce the overtaxed bait dollars extortion, and you wasted another half hour getting checked by the enforcers......... Forget that, I'll stay in the US. Even Michigan's ridiculous taxes are nothing in comparison to Ontario's."
1159262,v-bay gord,2010-01-10 15:57:00,3168,"Would you like some cheese with that ""whine""?"
1159299,fisherman 1,2010-01-10 18:35:00,39,You are definitly right Gord!!
1159352,troutaholic,2010-01-11 05:05:00,827,"Personally, I feel that Esox did a good point of pointing out Canada's imbalance regarding the bait situation. If you have something to refute his information, please do so. Otherwise, allow a person that is knowledgable on the subject to express his opinion!!"
1159381,v-bay gord,2010-01-11 07:22:00,3168,"When someone makes statements such as ""Ontario makes it clear they don't want us"" and ""It's all just an Ontario money grab"" and ""forget it, I'll just stay in the U.S."" , then I think this is basically a ""whine"" and one man's slanted opinion. As far as being ""knowledgeable on the subject"", why would I assume that? He lumps nightcrawlers in with the rest of his whine, which are NOT part of any cross-border restriction (assuming they are in artificial bedding). He also downplays the importance of VHS and other diseases and foreign species that can be transported through live bait. There is no control in a ""reciept"". It is an important issue that deserves enforcement, even if it is somewhat inconveinient. Troutaholic.....if you think my original reply was an attempt to squelch an ""opinion from someone knowledgeable on the subject"" then you are wrong. It was just my opinion on his opinion. Do we need to get out more cheese?"

He lumps nightcrawlers in with the rest of his whine, which are NOT part of any cross-border restriction (assuming they are in artificial bedding). Thats a heck of an assumption. I go to the bait shop and buy Canadian Crawlers. They are in humus, the way they were shipped from Canada. I just can't take it back the 500 yards to Canada on my boat. But I can buy the same blue container from the same worm farm in Windsor and it is OK to use after Ontario taxed it. Wow.Quote: He also downplays the importance of VHS and other diseases and foreign species that can be transported through live bait. There is no control in a ""reciept"". It is an important issue that deserves enforcement, even if it is somewhat inconvenient. I don't downplay the VHS issue, VHS is already in the waterway. There is no control in a receipt? Then why does the MNR require that you have a receipt from Ontario for your bait? The only difference betwen a MI reciept and an Ontario reciept is that Ontario didn't get to tax the MI reciept. They both have VHS certification.There are hundreds of MI anglers that won't fish Ontario anymore. For the Canadian restaurants, bait shops, and other businesses we would visit when we wanted to, without being forced to, it is a loss."

1157959,Seanik,2010-01-04 19:52:00,218,"As of July 1st, 2010 a new Harmonized Sales tax will go into effect in Ontario. It seems to be a tax of 13% on goods and services. How will this affect us as non residents of Canada? Will we for example be paying an additional 130.00 in taxes on a trip that cost 1000.00 and is it possible to get a full or partial refund? I was surprised when I saw the word Harmonized and an additional amout due on a recent deposit receipt I got from my outfitter. Seanik"
1158022,GNO,2010-01-05 07:55:00,153,"It will effect non residents just like residents, you will pay 13% on most goods including your fishing trip. You will be able to get a refund of 50% on your fishing trip if the package qualified for a rebate under the latest GST rebate program(forget the name). If teh package does not qualify, then you will pay the 13% and receive no refund. Your outfitter can do this on the spot for you if they choose. It does create extra paperwork for them, but that is what we have been doing and will continue to do."
1158056,SimilarIsland,2010-01-05 10:58:00,121,"Lucas, Is this on top of the taxes they already collect? Thanks"
1158068,JDP,2010-01-05 11:56:00,1457,"After reading a posting of the plan by the Ontario government, I believe that the new 13% tax will replace the 10% tax on a housekeeping cabin (5% GST plus 5% PST) tourists have been paying. The net will be a 3% tax increase on lodging, etc. Again this is based upon what I have read. Not based upon responses of resort operators. Hopefully, a resort operator will post his/her interpretation. JDP"
1158167,v-bay gord,2010-01-05 19:56:00,3168,"What you have been paying in the past is 8% PST plus 5% GST. The exception is the tax on accomodation.....ie, a housekeeping cabin....which was 5% plus 5%. So the bottom line is the new tax of 13% will replace what you currently have being paying, other than the extra 3% on accomodation. Now, what the new rebate of 50% means, I'm not sure how that washes out. With the exchange rate being on a yo-yo string of 5-10%, who can make heads or tails out of anything? My advice, just bend over like the rest of us and take it like a man!"
1158181,GNO,2010-01-05 21:10:00,153,"Craig - This tax replaces the PST - GST tax you are used to. It will be add costs to some expenses. Certain things only had GST such as flying. Now it will go from 5% to 13%. That will be a bigger expense. It really won't change much for most on a trip who are taking a package since you get 1/2 of the 13% back. It will be better for me as an operator, alot will beg to differ, but after doing the math for my business it will be better."
1158199,SimilarIsland,2010-01-06 03:05:00,121,Thanks Lucas.
1159022,Muskie Bob,2010-01-09 08:44:00,45,"reading a little more about this tax and discovered some items exempt before will no longer be exempt.....http://canadaonline.about.com/od/money/a/ontariohst.htmGasoline will now be taxed.......13%....small increase...eh...Since gasoline, heating fuel, electricty, etc. will no longer be exempt, the resorts will have to raise their rates....eh....Perhaps the small increase will be a lot more than others think.....eh.."
1159034,SSA,2010-01-09 09:32:00,19,"I agree with GNO. Certain aspects the tax goes up but for the small buissness owners theres alot of advantages being amended with differnt rebates/cuts. Overall, in our buissness this will benifit us. Just the hastle of learning and getting use to a new system."
1159125,GNO,2010-01-09 19:54:00,153,"The new tax will not effect the people visiting the resorts so much. You were paying 10-13% already on their vacations. If your package was elgible for a rebate, then you were paying 10.5% after the rebate. Now if your package qualifies you will only be paying 6.5%. Even with some things not being exempt, it will still benefit my business more. It will effect me more personally than my business. The Ontario residents ware effectd the most. I believe it is very nice for visitors to be able get a rebate back if they took a package. It would be nice if I could find a placce to visit for a vacation and get some of the taxes I paid back."
