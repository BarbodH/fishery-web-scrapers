1126457,Lazy Fisherman,2009-08-05 05:18:00,276,Thanks for the replies. I guess it would be a long trip for us. I had always wondered about the difficulty of getting in there.
1126463,dewyg,2009-08-05 05:49:00,1006,Go thru at Ash rapids and your there. Its not really a bad trip and the fishing is well worth it. I would give it a try if you have a free day.

Lots of uncharted rocks, though, if you go I suggest you stop by Shoal Lake Lodge (it's the only lodge on the lake, just to the north of the main track if you have a GPS) and ask to look at their map. They've marked lots of red dots to stay away from based on what their indian guides have told them and I'm sure they'd be happy to let you take a look at it."

That area was mined and logged heavily we were told. There are deadhead logs that pop to the surface and then sink again. I've never seen so much open water other than the Great Lakes where you see nothing on the horizon but water. No reefs or hazzards are marked. Our group caught & released 5 or 6 walleye 30"" or more plus large northern. The big walleyes were hitting larger Rapalas & crankbaits you would normally use for Pike. We also caught some huge bass. We entered Shoal through Ash Rapids. It is very interesting and beautiful. Just be careful."
1128896,Dipstick,2009-08-14 21:20:00,101,"Regulations for Shoal Lake above Ash Rapids ""Live fish may not be used as bait or possessed for use as bait."" ""Walleye closed all year"". This means no angling for them, period! Catch and release of walleye IS NOT allowed. Be careful with this one. To be safe, release all walleye that are accidently caught without bringing them into the boat, not even for a picture. Any guide who took the clients in for catch and release angling for walleye was breaking the law and putting their clients in a situation where they would be ticketed. That area is patrolled regularly."
