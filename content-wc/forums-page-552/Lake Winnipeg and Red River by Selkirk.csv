1162827,Hawgeye,2010-01-24 12:30:00,1355,"Looking for a fishing, ice condition and snow conditions report. There are four of us from Fargo area that would like to go the weekend of February 20th. We have AtV's but not snowmobiles. Need to determine if it is possible to get around on ATV's and if not, we need to look into being guided. If transportation is available, we have portables and all the gear we need, just concerned about getting around with ATV's. Also, we are interested in renting or using a guide service for houses and transportation. Want to get a shot at some trophies... Does anyone have any suggestions, offers or advice? Thanks Hawgeye"

I would phone Bob From Pro-Am tackle in Winnipeg 204-668-3245 ( Tell him Bandit sent you ) Or maybe Manitoba Walleye ( Roger ) may send you a PM Fishing is spotty but still lots of big fish. I had 2 over 28"" & only fish for 6 hours this weekend"
1163140,Hawgeye,2010-01-25 14:03:00,1355,"Bandit, Thanks for the response. I have met Bob and will call him. Our group always stops at Pro-Am and get our bait. Boris was an awesome guy and Bob seems equally as helpful. I will give him a call. It sounds like you caught the kind of fish we are looking for! We have plenty of lakes around here to catch ""eaters"" but the thrill of battling a ""greenback"" through the ice would be a thrill! I have caught plenty out of the boat in the fall but would like to do it through the ice. I welcome additional feedback and thanks again for the information. Hawgeye"
