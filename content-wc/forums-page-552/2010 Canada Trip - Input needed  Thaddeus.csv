Walleye fishing was unbelievable in Moose and the far south shoot of Ord. I know a few resorts owners in the area were thankful for the good fishing there, also. Fishing was much better before they improved the road. It use to take a good hour to travel the 12 miles from 105. Pete"

While the fishing can be slow at times, the water is very managable, and still can produce big fish (29"" 'Eye mounted in my den). Don has always been great to us, and has been helpful in everyway possible. Although he's retiring this year, he's hanging around with the new owners, to help them out. Indicative of Don's caring and comittment. And, becasue I doubt Don would sell to just anyone, I am sure the new owners will follow suit. Hope that helps. And have a great trip, no matter what!!"
1162191,JayM5209,2010-01-21 21:56:00,1050,"JohnnyV, do a search on this site for Gold Arrow Camp. It has been discussed several times in the past. I have spent at least one week per year there for more than 30 years, and will be back the 3rd week of May this year. Need I say more?? I'm sure the new owners are committed to maintaining the high quality facilities and service that Don and Sharon Moore provided over the years.Based at Gold Arrow, you have easy access to the 12 or more lakes on which Gold Arrow has boats cached. Lots of variety for you and your son, plus good fishing for walleyes, small mouth, lake trout. Probably pike, too, but we never intentionally fish for them.Do fish Ord. It's my favorite lake. Great walleye lake. Someday my ashes will sink to the bottom of Ord's Puzzle Bay."
1162289,Muskie Bob,2010-01-22 10:11:00,45,"Not familiar with Gold Arrow Camp.As to Thaddeus, I think there is only one resort on it. As to going from Thaddeus to Ord or from Ord to Thaddeus, there is a tunnel under a road. The current flows from Thaddeus to Ord. We went through the tunnel last year for the first time. The water level didn't look deep enough for the 75 hp outboard and the water was too strong for the trolling motor, so we grabbed the rope along the side of the tunnel and pulled through. A smaller outboard motor may not have that much problem going through. Others may offer better advice.The road going from 105 to Ord could be of a problem. I wouldn't try it without checking with others concerning the road conditions or having a 4 wheel drive. Probably not a good idea with a 12 year old.I assume Moose lake is the better lake for walleye fishing, as I've seen guides from Thaddeus taking boats up there. I like Puzzle Bay for northern pike.I'm more into muskie and northern pike fishing and fish Cedar Lake a lot. Almost everyone was catching walleye there last year. One of the better years. I stay at Northern Lights Resort.http://www.clarksresorts.com/norther...ernlights.htmlCheck out to see if your child qualifies for a discount for the dates you are going. The deluxe cabins are worth it. TV may help with a 12 year old. And, aircondition and diswasher comes in handy sometimes.Connie and Jeff manage the resort and go out of their way to see you have a great time. There is a toll free number to call.Oh yea, I forgot to mention that there are small mouth in Cedar Lake. We meet a couple of guys last year that comes there just to fish for small mouths.good luck where ever you go...."
1162595,bpetersen,2010-01-23 12:31:00,251,If you are still interested. I have made a map of how to get to Ord and some fishing spots we always had great luck. Send me a PM and i will send you my map. Bigdog
