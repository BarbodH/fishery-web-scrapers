1162806,SimilarIsland,2010-01-24 11:24:00,121,Camp Manitou or Ivanhoe?
1162822,Outfitter17,2010-01-24 12:15:00,127,"Hey Harvey,Good to see you on the board. Camp Manitou had 2 new transfer tanks and pumps hooked up to 2 new cabins in late may last year. We had to wait 3 days for a MOE from Kenora to come in to OK the work and add it to the existing septic. We didn't operate those 2 cabins during the wait, but we never had any violations. I think you may have gotten some wrong information.Harvey,Email me at [email protected] If you want some guide dates for this summer. I am always looking for good guides that know the area.Matt"

Is this a good lake for kids or does anybody have other suggestions that are affordable. The kids have been raised on walleye lakes and prefer smallies, northerns and muskies. Any info on this lake or other suggestions would be greatly appreciated!"
1159904,GNO,2010-01-13 08:48:00,153,"Manitou has lots of bass with excellent potential for trophy musie. Always seem to get some nice pike mixed in with the smallies. $700 for 2 kids and an adult sounds like a great deal, what camp are you looking at going to."

1160026,GNO,2010-01-13 18:01:00,153,"The nice part about staying on the strtch is wind won't be an issue. The big lake can get rough sometimes. This will always let you get out no matter what the conditions are. Are you looking at the main camp or outpost. Real good laker hole right behind the main camp. Phairs and Flossie is usually always real good smallies and very close to the outpost. There is a member named Similar Island, he fishes the Manitou alot and can give you good info about the different times of year and what to expect. I am sure he will chime in once he sees this."
1160177,10 Pound,2010-01-14 10:46:00,356,Thanks! I think we are going to go ahead and book the trip. Your info was very helpful and any info that anyone else could offer would be great! Our goal is to give our 4 boys (ages 10 - 16) a trip to remember for a lifetime! Thanks!
1160439,Guest,2010-01-15 12:06:00,0,"I have fished the manitou approx. 20 weeks over the last 9 years. Can be awesome, can be tough. Bass fishing has improved every year. muskies are definetly there and can be huge. I caught my PR last year at 52 inches. (swear i saw one real close 3 times over 60 inches). Pike good early , cant find em in the hotter months. lakers reign as the predominate species but we don't fish em. No walleye to speak of except we know were there are 2 or 3 spots to catch em and get 2 or 3 per trip at 25 plus inches. Don't fish by camp manitou so don't know any spots there. pass camp manitou on thr way in and out. All in all not a numbers lake and have done better elsewhere in canada. it is however big clean and beautiful"
1160764,SimilarIsland,2010-01-16 17:56:00,121,"Hey 10pound, When are you going? I'll be up there the last week in May and probably again in September."
1161131,10 Pound,2010-01-18 10:19:00,356,Week of July 4th. Let me know how you do.
1161177,Marbletucky,2010-01-18 13:23:00,6,"I'm looking for exactly the same kind of trip. 2 adults and 4 boys about the same age range. This camp sounds nice and affordable but I'm hoping for someplace that offers greater numbers, particularly northerns. Looking at one of the Air Ivanhoe places. Anyone know about them? Have been to Showalters quite a few times but that's a little far north for what will be a 4 day trip. Coming from Ohio."
1161215,SimilarIsland,2010-01-18 15:48:00,121,"Manitou has plenty of smallies, northern and lake trout to catch and with pretty good size. For muskies, it's more of a size lake."
