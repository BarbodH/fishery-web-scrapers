1160633,Glenman12,2010-01-16 06:11:00,762,It was my understanding that one of the reasons for instituting the outdoor card was so people could order their licenses online. I have checked the Ontario MNR website but I dont see anything like that. Does anyone know if this is the case and when online ordering will begin?

1160649,JDP,2010-01-16 07:52:00,1457,"""The target implementation date for the new system is late 2010"". Here is the the link to the Ontario MNR website. The message is on the right side of the page.http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LetsFish/ JDP"
1160656,WalleyeWally28,2010-01-16 08:19:00,298,Guess I should have entered my Outdoors Card number and gone further in the process to find out it wouldn't work. Thanks JDP for getting us the right info.
1160776,Glenman12,2010-01-16 18:58:00,762,Thanks for the info guys..I'll just order the license over the phone like I did last year..
1160784,Golden Eagle,2010-01-16 19:23:00,2642,Walmart would figure out how to do it now.

1163147,CAFish,2010-01-25 14:22:00,3,"That was my understanding also (to ultimately allow online licensing), however, last week I called the 800 number on the back of my card and the gal said it probably won't happen until 2011."
