Nemer, EsquireEveryone knows that in the course of one's life they will be in a crisis situation, that if they have been properly educated in advance , they may have a reasonable chance of survival and maybe even a great time .This is true when you face a Moose or a Bear but NOTHING out there can prepare you for an encounter with a one or more lawyers especially when you are fishing in the same boat with them!I , have seen the light, felt remorse and painful regret, so I am now betraying my judicial brotherhood by teaching you all, the best way to escape legally unharmed when fishing with a pack of vicious and deadly man eating LAWYERS. Believe me when I say this and I am taking a great risk in doing so. You can actually enjoy yourself and catch the biggest fish of your life. NO FOOLING! Firstly: You must disarm the lawyers as soon as you lay eyes upon them. If you can see the whites of their eyes, you are in mortal peril, so .disarm with kindness. They are not used to that. Smile and take them immediately out on the boat to catch big Walleye and Huge Northern pike. This was put into action and field tested in June of 2005. Kevin Geary used this survival technique so effectively on Nungesser Lake ( NW ONTARIO) that the lawyers were catching monster walleye while still in their business suits. I caught a 28 inch monster and had a big grin on my face.Secondly: Make them feel comfortable and at ease. Just as you would use a soothing calm voice when confronted by a bear you must . by all means necessary do the same with the savage Lawyer. The best way to do so , is by engaging the lawyers in a legal discussion that is interesting to them. Like a 10 lb slab of meat in front of a wolf pack ,this will do the trick. A great case study in Lawyer survival was experienced by Mr. Dennis Kellner while fishing in the same boat for walleye on Nungesser lake with a most vicious attorney of renowned legal viciousness.. A Mr. Stanley H. Nathanson.It was early spring of 2006 and Mr. Kellner realizing the extreme danger that he was in, engaged in a legal discourse with said UBER LAWYER! The lawyer became docile and even playful. Imagine that And as an extra bonus ,Mr. Kelner then proceeded to catch the biggest walleye of his life. A 32 inch MONSTER.One benefit that should be known to all is that lawyers are like leprechauns. If they like you then they can bestow their greatest gift to you THE LUCK OF THE LAWYER! Mr. Kellner applied this survival tactic to such an extent that the lawyer bestowed upon him his luck and look what he got! A 32 inch MONSTER WALLEYE! So please take to heart what I have said and maybe you may survive and even flourish on a fishing encounter with the most deadly beings on the planet. LAWYERS!HINT: If you want to see these and other great photos please ask me and I will tell you were to see them."
