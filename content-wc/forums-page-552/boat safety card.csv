1164606,Moondog,2010-01-30 09:35:00,362,"Anyone hazard a guess how this will be enforced? Like on my 42nd day am I going to be stopped by the MNR and they ask for the card, I don't have one, and then put bamboo shoots under my fingernails until I 'fess up how many more days I will be staying?? Checked the Boat Smart Canada Card is $50 +GST."
1164629,Flip Silverlake,2010-01-30 11:01:00,645,"I do know that they know when you went across the boarder and if you left the country during your stay, so, if you have an accident and a boaters safety card becomes an issue in court that's where it could really be a problem. It's all based on ""how lucky do you feel""."
1164631,Flip Silverlake,2010-01-30 11:03:00,645,"I got miine from the Wisconsin DNR cost me $10.00 to take the test and a couple of hours of class time. The rule states that a boater safety card issued in your home state, if your U.S, qualifies for Canadain requirements."
1163234,bluegussler,2010-01-25 18:07:00,124,Just found out if you operate a canadian outfitters boat you will need a boaters safety card. online test is $30 in Wisconsin;It takes at least 3 hrs to complete
1163293,Flip Silverlake,2010-01-25 19:50:00,645,"The boater safety card rule is that if you operate a boat in Canada for more than 45 days you need a boaters safety card. If you rent a boat ,say for a week. the rental aggrement will state that the fella that rented the boat to you went over the safe operation of the craft. This will be the same as a card. If your a Canadain operating your own boat you will need a card. This is dependent on where the boat is registered. If it has a U.S. regestration your under the 45 day rule, meaning that if you in Canada for more than 45 days you need the card, if under 45 days you need nothing. If it's Canadain you need the card or rental aggement without reguard to length of stay."
1163463,Moondog,2010-01-26 12:33:00,362,"Flip, Can you post a link showing this in Canadian Regs??? We spent 7 weeks in Canada last year and no one ever mentioned a boaters safety card plus we were boarded regularly by the MNR and OPP. Moondog"

1163622,fisherman 1,2010-01-26 20:30:00,39,The legislation didn't come into effect until mid September of 2009
1163920,Kevin R,2010-01-27 19:17:00,305,How the Regulations Apply to Non-Residents The Regulations apply to non-residents: If they operate their pleasure craft in Canadian waters for more than 45 consecutive days.Who boats 45 consecutive days ?
1163944,Flip Silverlake,2010-01-27 20:36:00,645,I do.
1163953,J-Man,2010-01-27 20:55:00,191,"The 45 day rule applies to the person and/or the boat. If you store your boat in Canada for a season, you'll need an operator card or other proof of competency.The regs don't state this clearly in most cases, but I did contact Transport Canada directly and had a supervisor interpret the regulations for me.The MNDNR does a boater safety card through the mail for free. Some of our seasonal guests got their card from MN that way last summer.Also, an outfitter can provide the renters checklist or not. Some may choose to only rent to those that have the card or proof of competency. If you rent boats through your outfitter, you may want to confirm that the checklist will be available if you do not have a card."
1163963,Moondog,2010-01-27 21:35:00,362,So do we!
1164047,Flip Silverlake,2010-01-28 09:10:00,645,I have a place on Pine Portage Bay on Lake of the Woods just east of Kenora. The way things are going around here I may be looking at staying up there year round!
