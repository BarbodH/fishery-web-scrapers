Ont. & then a very short flight to V.I. Once @ Viking Island & Douglas Lake you will have access privileges to what I remember to be 7 or 8 additional lakes. We went late May or early June. An excellent experience with a very well run camp. Fishing was good also. We caughtLake Trout, Walleye & Northern Pike. In our trips they only offered 7 day stays(Sat. to Sat.). We visited during the mid to late 90's. They have a website under ""Viking Island"" & do visit major boatshows in the upper midwest. Look them up to see what their present packages entail."

My friend and I have experienced Canadian fishing for several years. This year is a little different, only four of eight have experienced Canadian fishing. Should be a blast!We are flying into Minneapolis from Denver and driving to Red Lake, ON. Then we fly to Donald Lake from Red Lake. I think the plane ride is fairly short. More info on this area is much appreciated.LoDo"
