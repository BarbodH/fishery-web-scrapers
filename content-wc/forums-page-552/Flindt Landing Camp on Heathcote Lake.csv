1162572,ScottL,2010-01-23 11:01:00,733,Looking to hear from anyone that has stayed with Flindt Landing Camp on Heathcote Lake. I am intrigued by the fact that this camp is accessible by fly in or rail service only. Would like any input from anyone that has been there and taken the train to get there.

I remember getting the brochures year ago along with Allanwater Bridge- www.allanwater.comI did go go Sonny Bob Lodge on the Algoma Central railway. There are a number of rail access lodges on the Algoma Central Railway, north of Sault Ste. Marie. In the US you can go to Devils Lake North Dakota on Amtrak and fish for Walleye, etc. I enjoyed the experience.Gary"

We drove to Sioux Lookout on a Sunday, stayed at the Best Western, and caught the train early Monday morning. It was about a two hour trip to camp. We stayed until Friday and the train picked us up around midnight. We really enjoyed the trip last year. Staying in Sioux Lookout the night before let us unwind from the drive from Indiana. Even with the cost of a room added to the train tickets it was considerably cheaper than a float plane. We are taking the train again this August. One thing in our favor was the weather. It was good for both ends of the trip. It would not be as enjoyable waiting for the train in Sioux Lookout if you had to stand in the rain waiting (the train station is closed). At Flindt Landing you wait in the owners cabin. The train was about 45 minutes late for both trips. Flindt Landing is the only camp on the 17 mile long lake. Plenty of water to fish without seeing anyone else. If you do decide to go and take the train, you cannot wait too long as tickets will sell out. That happened to us two years ago and we had to fly in. If you have any questions email me at [email protected] and you can check a posting from earlier in the year, just search Flindt Landing. Jay"
