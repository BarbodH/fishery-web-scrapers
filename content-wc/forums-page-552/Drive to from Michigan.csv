The trips have been nothing short of great, even in late August. The accommodations, equipment, and their attention to details are very good. They are new owners to this camp and know how to treat people in a vacation atmosphere.They also know what they are doing on the lakes and in the woods. Caught good numbers of both walleye & Northerns. Check out the website atBracelakeoutfitters.com Then give them a call, You won't be disappointed. Give me a PM if your interested in more info & Pics.Best of luck.Kindest Regards,Rob Last edited by fishforlife; 01-23-2010 at 03:29 AM."

The best place we've been to for numbers and size of fish is O'Sullivan Lake near Geraldton Ontario. It's a long drive, (16 hours) but well worth it. There are two outfitters that I'm aware of O'sullivans Rainbow Lodge, they fill up pretty quickly and O'Sullivan Lkae Outfitters who we are trying out this year. The Rainbow lodge is well run, the cabins are nice, but a tad small, but running water and bathroom in a nearby building. Boats were top notch and again the fishing was out of this world. By the way the lake is exactly what you're looking for in that it has mostly walleye, good pike, no smallmouth that I'm aware of, but some VERY large trout. Good luck Larry"

It is a great lake, lots of structure, islands and places to fish. For a drive in lodge from SE MI, you'll be hard pressed to find another lake with that quality of fishing."
