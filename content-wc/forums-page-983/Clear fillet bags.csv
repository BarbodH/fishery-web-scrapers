Have always used large zip-locks, but sometimes need a larger bag to keep the whole fillet flat and viewable. Is there anything others use that is better?"
517013,NateW,2002-02-07 11:03:00,96,"We use a foodsaver. You know, one of those vacuum food sealer things they have informercials on TV about. Don't laugh. Mine is one of the best purchases I've made and you'll find they're very popular on this board. (It was this board that talked me into buying one!) Anyway the Foodsaver bags can be cut to whatever size you want if you just buy a roll of bags. They're clear plastic so the MNR can identify the type of filet. The sealed bags will last longer than zip-locs and keep you filets better protected too. Cost is about $100 at any Wal-Mart, Sams, Gander Mountain, Galyn's, K's Merchandise, etc.I also use mine on duck breasts, pheasant and whole trout. We use it for stuff to take to Canada as well as bringing fish home. We'll cook and freeze some meals first, then seal them with a foodsaver. I have some first-aid supplies I kep in a sealed bag in my tackle box for emergencies. My Wife and I also use it for freezing sweet corn in the summer. We had fresh Iowa sweet corn on Christmas day and it tasted great! We use the silly thing in about 200 diferent ways! It's awesomeOne little hint on sealing fish filets. Freeze them before sealing them in the bags. The vacuum is so trong, it will tear filets apart unless they're frozen first. Do a search on Foodsavers on this board and you'll own one in a week! Enjoy!Nate"
517014,Behle,2002-02-07 12:41:00,51,Thanks. I also like the idea of packing things before hand. Where we go we are a little limited on electricity. Generator only runs during daylight hours so freezers don't always get fish completely frozen.
