Does anyone out there have an Idea of what the fishing will be like during the first week of June, within an 45 min radius of Pelican Lake?Will the spawn be over?Any info is appreciated.""Whack'em and stack'em""(more of a deer/pheasant hunting saying, but I wanted to add something clever)"

516232,Guest,2002-01-15 12:11:00,0,"Looking for info on the Moosehorn Lodge, I think they are on Pelican Lake with lake access to Lac Seul.Trip Is scheduled for June 2nd.What can you tell me about the fishing at that time of year, are we going to have to take the longer boat ride into Laac Seul. Or will we find good fishing closer to the lodge?Fishing for Walleyes.What can you tell me about the resort?How about baits?ThanksAVS"

516233,Guest,2002-01-15 17:20:00,0,"If you are going without a guide, get a map and have them mark rocks, etc,including those in the middle of a lake. Last fall I was cruising in 35' of water, went over a 'boulder' and was back into 35' of water before I could get the motor up. Just be careful and only go where the managers tell you, unless you go slow. Enough of the cautions.Fishing Lac Suel is fantastic. In one two hour period up there, 3 people in my boat caught and released 8 walleyes. the SMALLEST was over 25"" long. Largest was 30"".Have fun. Lac Suel is well worth the trip."
