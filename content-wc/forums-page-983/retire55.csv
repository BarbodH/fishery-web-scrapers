As well, your responses to date have reflected a preoccupation with unreasonably prejudiced and intolerant views of Aboriginal society. Consequently, to continue to attempt to debate BOQ walleye fishery issues with you is considered unproductive.Thanks for freely admitting that you are both intollerant and racist. At least aboriginal people will know where they stand the next time that they deal with you. Do the bay a favour and stay out of any solutions talk until you can get over it.O:nen"

517048,Guest,2002-02-10 11:01:00,0,A woman once said to me that if you are born Mohawk then you are born political. It didn't make sense then but it sure does now.I think what it means is that we will protect our people at any cost. Oka (Kanahsatake) is a good example.;)
517049,Guest,2002-02-10 15:24:00,0,"She:kon!Thanks for the vote of confidence Curtis. But this is more about awakening a mindset that can't see itself even when surrounded by mirrors. I suppose that it always ends up political when one cannot comprehend the damage that these world views do to other human beings, even though it is really a form of synchronicity. As always it usually starts outs with a Spiritual challenge and ends up in fear when the student refuses to learn according to his own terms - terms he doesn't realize that he set out in his first communication.O:nen"

But, by calling someone a racist after a few posts is not really knowing the person. It is for that reason that I shut myself out of your point of view. Perhaps, we could all learn by looking in the mirror. But, I believe the post that said this is a fishing board and not a political one was the wisest of us all. I reiterate my point from a week ago that it is no wonder the ""antis"" seem to love attacking us. We fight so much amongst ourselves, we're an easy target from an outside group."
