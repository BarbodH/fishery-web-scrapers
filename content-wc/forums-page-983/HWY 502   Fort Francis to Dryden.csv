516860,Guest,2002-02-03 10:37:00,0,What would make 2002 different from any other year?But in all seriousness the work/improvements that have been made to 502 over the past few summers are VERY! much appreciated and the delays that I've encountered have been relatively short.Mike
516861,Guest,2002-02-03 13:53:00,0,"The delay is not so bad, it's all the slime they put on the gravel to keep the dust down on the road. If you hit it just right and it slimes your boat, trailer, and tow vehicle, it can take up to four hours just to get them clean again once you're home. Personally speaking, if they are working on 502 again this summer I will take an alternate route to avoid this."

By July, there's still construction, but they've filled in the potholes. Best driving is in late August - construction is done, potholes are beginning to reappear (but they're small), AND there's almost no traffic.I've tried the alternate routes and the extra hours of driving time didn't seem worth it (and the roads aren't in much better shape)."
516863,Guest,2002-02-05 18:05:00,0,"Karl,I don't know where you are heading out of Dryden, but have you tried highway 71 or highway 622 as alternate routes? I usually head up to Sioux Lookout, and am wondering if you have tried highway 622? It's a little longer and takes a little more time, but am wondering how it compares to highway 502 as far as hills and curves (and logging trucks) are concerned?Jig'N'John"
516864,Karl,2002-02-06 21:50:00,63,"I go north on 72 from just east of Dryden. My destination is Lake Minnitaki, just south of Sioux Lookout. Have not drive 71 or 622. They completely resurfaced 72 three years ago and it's in really good shape. Makes the last part of the drive a lot easier."
