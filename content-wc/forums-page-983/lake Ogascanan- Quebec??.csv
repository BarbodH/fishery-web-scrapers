516875,Guest,2002-02-02 18:59:00,0,Just wondering if any members here have fished out of Lake Ogascacan in Quebec lately and what their honest opinions are of this lodge.I would like to take a friend up there this Spring. Their website looks good but looks can be deceiving.Thanks in advance. Pete
516876,Guest,2002-02-07 21:30:00,0,"Did a fall fishing trip there in the fall of 2000. A couple of things that I can say about the lodge; Ginny and Brad are top notch. Cabins are sufficient. Boats (in my opinion) are too small for that lake. We were out in 2-3 footers and thought that we were going to swamp the thing. If you can take your own....I would. Be prepared to go slow down the road though. Finally the fishing. We hit a cold snap and we only able to fish a half day due to high winds. I did catch a 8 ob northern the first half hour of fishing. That is all our party caught. However, there were guys there with their own boats....and they caught some monster pike. Infact the one big fella that is on their brochure holding the 40"" northern was also there that week. That caught hogs that week. I can't give you a positive thumbs up...but the lake looked very promisingGood luck"

516878,Guest,2002-02-09 17:02:00,0,"Retire55- yes I remember your reply and yes we did go up to Ogascanan in late Sept-2000. We had terrible weather for 4 days, rain, snow and winds! Good thing we did take our own boat because as the previous post said, his boats are alittle too small for some of that lakes open water. We caught 54 wallies for the week. Nothing big but enough we had a few dinners and released all the others. We quit hauling fish back home many years ago and a few shore lunches and some pictures will do us fine.Brad and Ginny and the 2 boys were outstanding hosts. Brad is a very aware lodge owner who likes to keep abreast of his fishermen and their catches. He asked us to kinda keep a record of what we caught and released for his lake study.We are booked for the 2nd week in June this Spring and I was posting just to see if anyone has been up there since we were a couple years ago. Thanks again. Pete"
