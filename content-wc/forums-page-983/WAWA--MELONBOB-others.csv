516869,lenray,2002-02-02 17:20:00,467,I was wondering if a person could ride the quads from Ernies and take that road that goes out to the mine --that direction- and ride some of those new and old logging trails. Is that legal to do ???We would like to do some riding of the quads along with the fishing.thankslen

Even the Snorider snowmobile club had to get special permission and pay Wagner to have their winters trails stay on very specific trails. Even these snowmobile trails are only for winter use because Wagner is concerned about liability and forest fires on their land if ATV's used them also. So be careful you might have liability problems on some of this private land. The township that WAWA is on is not private land , just many of the other ones around it are.jake"
516871,Guest,2002-02-02 20:10:00,0,Thankyou wawajakeI was in error when I said WAWA I meant the land and rodes and trails going out of Missanabie towards the old mine.
516872,Guest,2002-02-04 05:55:00,0,"Sorry Lencan't help you there , never been to Missinabi.But I will say if they are active logging roads, the logging trucks don't take too kindly to having to worry about ATV's on their roads so be careful !!!jake"

Also, there are several roads off that one privately owned by logging companies, and it is illegal to use those roads to fish or hunt. This is a battle being fought in the courts right now, as these roads were being used to get to lakes for decades. It's a really confusing topic, the only advice I can offer is to go to the local MNR office in Wawa and ask specifically what you can do."
516874,Guest,2002-02-06 19:42:00,0,Thanks MELONBOB for the info. we just wanted to do some riding not trying to get to those lakes that are off limits.We have fished McKeown it is a left turn off the private rd. going to the mine it is back on one of those new roads.The first time into McKeown we took the very small and difficult trail that the brothers from Kentucky have been using.Down here in Michigan you can't ride a quad on a public road--the sheriff in my county told me that I could ride from farm to farm that I owned.len
