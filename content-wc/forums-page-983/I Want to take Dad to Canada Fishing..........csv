516928,Guest,2002-02-04 15:24:00,0,"Hi,My father will be celebrating his 80th birthday this year and I want to set up a trip fishing for walleyes in Canada. Please give me some affordable recommendations to contact. Here is some information to narrow down the search.-4 men, looking to drive approx. 1 hour north of Baudette or International Falls. At this point we are either at our spot or on a boat ride shuttle to our destination.-spend 4days/3nights at resort with easy access to boat and lodge. Dad has had both hips replaced and struggles with uneven ground. Once in the boat, he's good to go!-either meals provided or bring own food and cook ourselves.-prefer sheltered fishing areas in case of strong west winds.-available dates in June or early July-spend about $100.00 per day/ per guy. includes boat,motor and graph.-no guide needed if you can provide lat/lon spots to try!The plan is for me to drive from Minneapolis and the others form North Dakota to my uncle's place on the Rainy River and cross the border early to fish AM the day we arrive. Please give me a shout if you can recommend nice clean accomodations that are a good value. Don't need luxury. More important to have a great outing with Dad and Brothers and not break the bank book!Sincerely,Greg."

Great boats, big walleye and big numbers(50/75 per guy/per day is reality) although you can only keep fish if you catch them in the other adjoining lakes, as CD is a catch-release lake. Cabins/accomodations are clean and the camp only holds maybe 30 fisherman in total with 6 cabins on the place. Then there are day trips/short portages to great smallmouth lakes. You need to bring your own food as there is no restaurant on this remote lake resort.Ph: 204 222-7307 ask for Bill and he will get you all the details.Have fun !>Hi, >>My father will be celebrating his 80th birthday this year >and I want to set up a trip fishing for walleyes in Canada. >Please give me some affordable recommendations to contact. >Here is some information to narrow down the search. >>-4 men, looking to drive approx. 1 hour north of Baudette or >International Falls.
