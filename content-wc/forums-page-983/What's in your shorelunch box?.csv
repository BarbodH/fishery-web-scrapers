517018,NateW,2002-02-07 12:01:00,96,"Just curious to see how much I really carry compared to everyone else.Me? I have two 13.5"" cast iron skilletts, two small sauce pans (one fits inside the other) two small mixing bowls, six Stainless steel plates, small container of flatware for six, two pot holders, pan scrubber, large spatula, two sets of tongs and a small propane tank that fuels my two-burner stove (The stove straps to the top of the box.) Call me a wuss for the propane stove, but I never have to search for dry wood and never have to worry about leaving hot embers behind. The guys in the other boats carry trhe cooler with the taters, soft drinks, batter mix, etc.Is that about what most people carry? Or am I over-loaded? Just curious......--Nate"
