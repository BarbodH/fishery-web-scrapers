516696,hksbh,2002-02-06 21:37:00,3,N M are there much for rock in the river and out in tramping to worry about and is at the river the best area for walleye.I have driven in to tramping except for the last block off the blacktop east of reed lake about 7 miles where the creek goes into tramping and have thought about putting a boat in of the road but it is pretty steep ditch.
516697,Northern Manitoban,2002-02-07 17:21:00,195,"Hksbk There is a gravel road that natural resourse has been using just 20 minutes down the road from Reed,we checked it out about 4 years ago because thats the end of Tramping Lake we usually fish,its close to that creek you talk about its a 4 wheel drive trail very rocky and a couple mud holes dry enough don't think it would be a problem,it would probably take ten minutes to get to the boat launch there and there is a small dock.But its pretty narrow tight for turning.We have always thought about launching this way but haven't yet.If you head down towards Snow Lake you can go to Wekusko lodge its right on the edge of the highway and you launch right on the Grassy,its very easy boat ride up the river into Tramping there are 2 spots marked with Plastic bottles to show the shallow spots,i usually go through almost full speed.Once you get onto tramping its straight across no reefs,very nice ride and lots to look at,like the old burns from the big fires in 89,and somewhere there is Indian paintings on the rocks don't look much to me looks more like rusty rocks lol.As for fishing we have yet tried the river part stick mainly to our spots and where the grassy runs into Tramping from Reed lake.Always done well there no trophys yet which has been discouraging because we have put alot of time into this lake every year,only trophy that we have caught was a pike 42 inches,biggest eye has been 26 inches and alot just over 20.Even camped there last fall for 3 days did very well but all small.Had one 5 day trip there 4 years ago 2 guys we landed around 500 fish it was awesome.Looking forward to going there in May when i'm at Reed for 5 days.Email me if you want more info.Dave. [email protected]"
516698,hksbh,2002-02-07 18:39:00,3,NM thats the trail I was at going into tramping it is a little low at the end . It would have to be dry to get threw it.I was thinking of bringing a atv up one of these years to take the 16'boat in to the landing.I always bring my deck boat up and wondering if that would get in to tramping at Wekusko falls it is 22'.
516699,Northern Manitoban,2002-02-07 19:22:00,195,"No need to worry,many big boats head up there.The launch launch is very deep."
516686,Guest,2002-01-28 15:48:00,0,Does anyone know how to get in touch w/ Petersons Reed Lake Lodge. I would like some info on their camp but do not know how to reach the owners. Thanks.
516687,Northern Manitoban,2002-01-28 22:55:00,195,"Loomis i live close by Reed lake fish there most of the year boat and ice.Are you looking for lakers? I know the lake pretty well.If you want any advice on were to fish there let me know.As for Petersons lodge info.Hal or Krista Peterson box 1648.the Pas Manitoba R9A-1L4.Sorry don't have a phone number.I don't know how well that lodge is doing on Reed the last 2 years never see any boats come out of that lodge seems most of the bussiness is coming from the other lodge Grass river lodge.I fish there during the summer and fall alot.Huge Pike and Walleyes,burbot, lake trout its an awesome fishery.Can hardly wait until May when i'm there for 5 days.If your intested in some pictures of fish we have caught out of there i can email them.FISH ON."
516688,Guest,2002-01-29 16:28:00,0,"N.M., any info would be great. We too would like to go in May. Grass River lodge looks like a nice place but they don't offer a housekeeping plan and thats what we like to do. Helps keep the price reasonable. I heard Peterson's offers a housekeeping plan but just didn't know how to reach them. We mainly fish for lakers and pike, but do like to catch walleyes for the frying pan. I'd love to see some pics from reed. You can e-mail me at [email protected]. Thanks, and good luck in May."
516689,hksbh,2002-02-05 19:03:00,3,Petersons dosn't open till june 1st I have been going up there for 15 years know and the fishing is great.We have allways been there june 1st but are going a week later this year. We stay at the campground right next to Grass River Lodge.
516690,Northern Manitoban,2002-02-05 21:49:00,195,HKSBH what species do you target on Reed I'm guessing by the times you go that your going for Lakers.I stay at the same campground every year during the summer and the fall time around October.This year we are going to make a camp on one of the islands or stay at one of the remote cabins.Will be ice fishing Reed next month.I'm pretty lucky its close to home.Kind of interested on what areas you fish and the luck you have.Myself never had a bad day Laker fishing yet.Alot of other lakes to drive to close buy for great walleye and Pike fishing also.I'll use Reed as my main camp during the summer and usually fish for lakers in the morning and then go for walleye's on these other lakes in the afternoon.FISH ON.
516694,Guest,2002-02-06 14:42:00,0,The latest that I have for contact is a listed phone number for the winter. Try 1-204-772-5826. I just did and talked to Hal Peterson.Carl L. WallManitoba ConservationFisheries Branch
516691,hksbh,2002-02-06 18:22:00,3,"N M we go there for the walleyes and northerns. I have not fished the trout because I doen,t like to eat them. Wouldn't mind trying some time but always run out of time.We fish the grassy quite a bite after the 1st of june for walleyes and always do well. Northerns at mouth of grassy but mostly Bucks or Woosy. Get alot of walleyes on the sand beach between jackfish and woosy.I have been trying to fish tramping for 2 years now but haven,t made it yet keep running out of time.What is the best way to get in to tramping any ideas would be great."
516695,Northern Manitoban,2002-02-06 19:29:00,195,"I fish tramping every year and it is a great fishery,i'll setup camp at Reed during the summer and drive to Tramping to fish for Walleye's from Reed lake its a 50 minute drive to the boat launch on the grassy river,Wekusko lodge boat launch,then you travel 40 minutes to the end of Tramping were the grassy runs into Tramping from Reed lake.Great fishing there.Not hard to get into there at all.FISH ON."
516692,RDbiteN,2002-02-06 21:04:00,4,I go to Canada every year but haven't been to REED in many years. We stayed at Grass River Lodge until they got too expensive and then went to Petersons for several years. Lots of good memories. We used to jump the beaver dams to get into Jackfish. To this day the best Walleye fishing day in my life was there. Do you know if that is still done?
516693,hksbh,2002-02-06 21:29:00,3,I have been going in to jackfish for the last 4 years and it keeps getting worse every year dams in different spots each year.We have not had good fishing at all but it is always fun to go up there. I had good fishing in jackfish 1 time about 9 years ago I think you have to be there at the right time like avery thing else.I have always been the 1st one up and the warer is really low and you have to idle up and the dams lately have been 4 foot.We use to get a lot of fish out front of the mouth of jackfish around the camp site but it has been slow there too. It seems like the fish have changed there patterns in the last 10 years we always find them in different places but we always find them.
