If you are going to go in the heat of the day, try bouncing a very small ( 1/8- 1/16 oz) chartreuse or corn colored jig tipped with the biggest, fattest leaeches you can find. I have found that either color works well and if you slow your presentationt o a crawl, yoou should boat some nice fish. There is also a very healthy pike population so take along a good selection of spoons and crankbaits. Hope this helps."
