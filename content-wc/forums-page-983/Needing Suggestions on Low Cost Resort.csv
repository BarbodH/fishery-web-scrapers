516879,Dave S,2002-02-02 22:55:00,314,I am looking into the possibility of taking my three teenage sons and wife fishing to western Ontario in the Sioux Narrows/ Perrault Falls/ Ear Falls areas. Looking for suggestions on a basic cabin/ or motel we might be able to stay in with decent fishing nearby. Have to be able to drive to the location as fly in cost x 5 people adds up in a hurray. Looking at late July or early August time frame. Plan on doing our own cooking. You can e-mail me at [email protected] . Seems like all the lodges with fancy websites and high cost advertising that I have found so far have daily rental rates that are three - 4 times what a person pays for a motel in the US and many times require a full weeks stay.
