516828,Fishoil,2002-02-04 12:58:00,1277,What's wrong with the International Skillet? I've been stopping there for years and never had a bad meal or bad service yet. Last year and this coming year we're even staying at the Super 8 next door to make it convenient so we can be back on the road early.
516835,Guest,2002-02-05 21:19:00,0,"There is no more International Skillet, it is now called the Chocolate Moose. Different owners and great food! The menu is never ending! Plus it is located next to The Super 8 and a gas station. Just my recommendation! (Being from International Falls)"
516836,Fishoil,2002-02-06 11:23:00,1277,Chocolate Moose?? LOL. Where'd they come up with that name? I've got 17 people coming in my group this year and we use all 3 of the above mentioned businesses every year with no complaints.
516829,BD,2002-02-08 12:34:00,739,"I've had undercooked, overcooked, ice cold and the wrong breakfast served to me at the Skillet. Only once was the waitress decent when there was a problem. I'm glad we found Barney's for our large group and some other diners when there are only a few of us. We also stay at the Super 8 and have done so for years. One of the other posts states that the Skillet has new owners. This must be the third or fourth set of new owners since it was a Country Kitchen. If the new owners stay on top of things and don't let the service etc. deteriorate, maybe they will be able to stay in business longer than the rest."
516837,Guest,2002-02-08 18:13:00,0,"The best place in I falls for breakfast is ""Sandy's Place"" right on west side of road coming towards downtown on 53, Int.falls a couple blocks before you make a right turn and then a left to cross the bridge. Pancakes the size of hub cabs! We own a lodge in NW Ontario and cross there frequently. Good Luck."
516838,bobnalong,2002-02-08 23:46:00,10,"take the extra five minutes and go to Grannie's in Ranier. The pancakes are great, and two is a load! Bob"

516823,Guest,2002-01-31 05:53:00,0,Can anyone help us with a good place for breakfast in International Falls before we cross the border?
516824,wiggle,2002-01-31 09:00:00,400,"The first restuarant on the right heading into International Falls is great for breakfast. If I remember correctly, there is a big, old fisherman standing out in front. The place isn't much to look at but beats the heck out of Mcdonalds. Have something with pancakes. ""Betcha can't eat the whole thing :)"""
516825,BD,2002-01-31 09:47:00,739,":) Barney's Resturant. We go with a large group and they can accomadate us. There is plenty of parking for vehicles with trailers. Plus the food and service are great. It's on Second St. about six blocks down. Take a left, away from the border, at the light.:( Pass up the International Skillet. The service and food there are not to be recomended."
516830,Dave,2002-01-31 10:46:00,258,My advice is to get there the night before and eat the BIG prime rib dinner at the Spot(Firehouse)Supper Club. I know you won't be hungry for breakfast in the morning.
516831,Big Laker,2002-01-31 10:59:00,53,"I agree, you can't go wrong at the Firehouse. Then in the morning you can get across the border before the line gets too long (and it does get long). If your still hungry, eat breakfast over in Canada."

516833,Guest,2002-01-31 14:41:00,0,I'll second that for Wenty's sisters place in the Fort... She really put's out if you know what I mean;) Don't worry about her husband he's a heavy sleaper.
516834,Guest,2002-02-01 05:00:00,0,Where else? The walleye cafe! On the right as you go thru.
516826,Guest,2002-02-01 05:40:00,0,Barneys is great. The Girls are friendly and pretty as well :)
516827,Guest,2002-02-01 14:24:00,0,You are right about the I-Skillet. TGG
