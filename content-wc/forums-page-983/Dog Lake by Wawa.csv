A late Ice out can slow this down, but this year not much ice so far, so could be earlier than normal spawn.Either way ,Should be great where you are going ,talk to your lodge guide.Good size minnows and jigging is what I stick to (white glow standup jigs) and change to worms later in June when I head for Sandbars.You should have some pike fun too so have some heavy stuff !!jake"

Look at the first points out from these areas, but be careful, all of Dog's main rivers are sanctuaries until June 15th. I almost always go with a 1/8 oz chartruse round jig with either a minnow or leech attached. Don't let anyone tell you leeches won't work this early, I start using them when season opens in May."
