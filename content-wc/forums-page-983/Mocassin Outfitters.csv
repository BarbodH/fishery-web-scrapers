517023,Guest,2002-02-08 14:06:00,0,"If you are referring to Mocassin Trails and Jack Rezny it is the best that I have come across. The services provided are all as depicted - no surprises, everything runs on schedule and is well organized. They charter top notch air services, the three camps I have been to have all been outstanding and the fishing is UNREAL. Each camp we have been to there has been no problem putting 100+ fish per man into the boat with a few dandies every day.The beauty of his camps is that VERY few people have ever been to these places. The toughest part is choosing which camp to go to because they all are so good. We decided on his new camp this year and have NO doubt that it will be a great trip.If you want any specific info on the camps that I have been to or anything else feel free to email me [email protected]lobo"
