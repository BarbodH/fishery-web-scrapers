Ill give a bit of info I live in Southern Ontario on the shores of lake Ontario, I mainly fish for bass and do the tournaments for Bass in the Kawarthas. I have a love for walleye fishing and frequent many northern lakes or walleye and pike. After my last recent trip to the French river (3 days) I said to my wife.. ""that's it im doing 6-7 days next time but far north"" haha. So here is my issues (not big) I want to come to fish Lac Seul and since there so many outfitters in the area its a little overwhelming. I think I've narrowed the search down to 3 resorts.. and would be traveling last week of may through first week of June. 1) Lac Seul lodge 2) onaway Lodge 3) Lac seul outposts okay 4) Lac Seuls scout lake resort. I would love to hear everyones feed back as to what resort would be best for time of year, I wont be bringing my boat I don't feel like pulling a 21ft bass boat 19 hrs. I guess shape of equipment and cabins and the kindness of owners. looking forward to eveyones thoughts . Cheers"

I've checked out the first two on your list nice resorts and owners. My thoughts would be call and see if you can get into any of them that time of year. That could be problem.
5122338,rather-be-fishin,2016-09-21 22:12:00,429,I have heard good reports on both Lac Seul Lodge & Onaway. Good location on the lake. You won't be disappointed in the quantity & quality of the Walleye you catch 10 months to go to our return trip to Lac Seul! RBF
5123154,Steve Ediger,2016-09-22 12:00:00,97,"I would highly recommend Lac Seul Lodge. They have very good and modern boats and motors. The cabins are first rate. You will be hard pressed to find a nicer bunch of people than those that own and or work at the lodge. I go there three times a year, in fact, I leave at 6:00 in the morning for my last trip of this year. Can't wait to get there. Steve"
5158066,Joek3,2016-10-17 20:53:00,244,Is crowded fishing spots a problem at LS Lodge? Several comments on the board recently about other boats moving in on people.
5158106,prov1800,2016-10-17 21:14:00,5010,Theres four lodges that all lead into a area called the bay of islands.in the summer when the fishing gets good in that area there arexa lot of boats in thisxarea ascwell as another called mackenzie bay.these areascare targeted by all four camps ascwell asanothervten camps in the ear falls area.most fisherman that are new to the lake will be looking for other boats and some will fish right in top if you.can get frustrating.and happens a lot.more nowadays than i can ever remember.
5158226,Pooch,2016-10-18 04:50:00,4619,"I've not found that to happen as much as others have. Happens once in a while during the trip. If it does I usually leave as I've probably got ""the goodie"" out of that spot by then anyway. Everyone has their own definition of ""too close"". It's a pretty darned big lake so there are always other places to fish. Besides a person should always be looking for new fish anyway instead of fishing the same spots all the time. Finding ""new"" fish usually means finding ""uneducated"" fish. That's my kind of fish!Don't let what others chat about ""crowded"" deter you. The Bay of Islands area is huge and I seldom run across another boat in any area I want to fish. MacKenzie, Steam Boat and other larger bays are very large and probably not really a bay per-say. More like a lake within itself.Just my two cents worth.Pooch"
5158394,Joek3,2016-10-18 05:52:00,244,Appreciate info. Fishing LS next year for first time and staying at LS Lodge. Can't wait.
