5128337,CowDoc75,2016-09-26 16:12:00,8,Been fishing in Canada 8 times but our group is doing a Fly-In for the first time. Leaning pretty hard towards Slate Falls Outposts. Going mid-July to front part of August. My 10 year old son's first trip up north and bringing both Grandpas with a ton of trips under their belts. Any recommendations on which lake to go with?

I fished Eagle Island on St. Joe last year with Slate Falls and was just at Miniss with Slate Falls Sept 11-17.Both would be great, but I'd probably lean towards Miniss. It's an incredible lake - large but with a crazy number of islands so there's no big wide open stretches of water. Problem if there is one, the amount of interesting structure to fish is almost overwhelming. We did very well though including one rainy day when we put way over 200 walleyes in the boat. Trophy pike were caught as well.As expected Slate Fall's cabin on Miniss was fantastic. Verne is a notch above most Ontario outfitters.I'll have a detailed write up done on the Miniss trip probably within a week or so."

The walleyes are fat, healthy and full of fight! From what Mike Bolger has written you can't go wrong with either outfitter! Life has such tough decisions to make!"

St Joe is probably a great option but look like to much open water for our groups liking. We have used both Vern and Hidden Bay Lodge at Miniss. Both do a great job. One year with Guardian Eagle, would not do that again. Go with the other 2. We went this summer with Hidden Bay again. Their hospitality is outstanding and we really enjoy their food included plan they offer. Just arrive at their base in Sioux Lookout and select the food options with their staff to be sent to the cabin with you. No hassles of going food shopping for the group. Just one stop to pick up the duty free beer and booze at the border. Does not get easier than that! You will have great fishing with either one you choose! Rob"
