1975810,fosterthedog,2013-07-23 16:18:00,51,"Got back about a week ago works been hectic so a little late in posting this report.Group of 4,2 return guys,1 new to Canada, and 1 new to fishing. Travel up went well Clova road was in good shape, little washboarded between Parent and Clova but did the 160 miles in 3 hrs same on the way out. Flew to Hebert the following morning were greeted by west winds 10-15mph. Got unpacked and readied fishing gear, had good luck on the first stop got 8 fish for supper, released 4 from 21-25"" and a 45""pike(Chris, new guy to fishing), great start. Headed back to camp for fish fry and cocktails. Back out in the evening to our night spot,got anchored in12' of water, fishing just got better through the nite. We were using lighted slip bobbers and jigging under the boat had at least one going the whole time. Doc my boat partner commented back at camp he caught more walleyes in 5 hrs. than in his entire life, hes 75 years young. Wind was a factor every day never the same direction but always windy,nights it was calm. Fished the windy side of any rock pile, island or shoal with good results, attempts to hide from the wind yielded some decent fish but the action wasn't as hot. One day was stormy, heavy rain and lightning, played pitch and drank all day weather calmed around 6pm went out and had our limit in a couple of hours. For the trip 1000+ eyes and a few pike. As Octanehi5 said this is a trip to put on your list if you live in the northeast(got to meet him for a short time but he was in a hurry to leave, right Ron), only 10 hr drive from Syracuse to Clova. We did set a new record for this trip 430 lbs overwieght, we go for vacation and a good time not to worry about money( an extra $80 dollars a man). Took a small generator, coffee maker, toaster, deep fryer,sattelite radio, 8-40packs beer and 6 handles of booze. Great trip,as always Air Tamarac is a great outfitter, if I can help make your trip to Hebert better post or PM me. Steve aka fosterthedog."
1975834,Pikeslayer8,2013-07-23 16:37:00,1460,Sounds like one heck of a pitch game. Pitch is also our game for such occasions. Spectacular trip and great report. What was the biggest?
1975866,fosterthedog,2013-07-23 17:00:00,51,"I won the pot with a 25 1/2"", vast majority of fish were in th 15 -20"" slot, probably 75-100 fish 21-25""s, plenty of smalls for next year. On the pitch game guy under the gun bids 2 with A,10/ I pass with K,J and a low my partner has the Q with low and another trump. We set them and bidder goes on a 10 minute rant about how we were sandbagging, god did we laugh."
1975970,5 of Diamonds,2013-07-23 17:49:00,151,fosterthedog:Nice trip report. Thanks for taking the time to post. Amen on the overload flight. Those extras make a difference.
1976042,Mike Borger,2013-07-23 18:08:00,1554,Sounds like a great trip and I agree whole heartedly about paying extra for overweight. When it's possible that's what I've always done.Hebert sounds like a heckuva lake.
1976833,octanehi5,2013-07-24 05:52:00,1104,"Steve, I'm glad you guys had a great time,Sorry about being in a hurry to leave but the plane was 30 mins. early.All of our guys set personal bests for walleye's.Only 430 lbs over is not bad, we had camps 25 &26 10 guys were 1200lbs over,on a trip like this its worth every penny, The Saturday you got to the lake was the roughest day on the lake but the best fishing.I will be working the Harrisburg show the first weekend in Feb.stop by air Tam's booth.Like I said before If you have never fished with Air Tamarac ,you need to put it on your bucket list Ron aka octanehi5"
1991985,octanehi5,2013-07-30 06:29:00,1104,"One of our guys that was on the first week of July trip Is going back up this Saturday,It will be interesting to find out what kind of bite they will have.He now knows the lake very well. The lac never warmed up as to normal temps,It will be a differant fish experiance the month of august, Fall looks like it setteling in early,with continueing temps below normal, The lac produced more fish in July than June,totally opposite of a normal yr."
5163442,potsie225,2016-10-22 09:57:00,41,"Hi Steve my name is Doug and I live in Rochester<NY I have sent you several emails but internet has been crazy last 2 days. I have followed your reports.

5163706,octanehi5,2016-10-22 16:32:00,1104,"Doug we fly in two days earlier than last yr giving us 9days on the lac,If someone has to leave early I always will take the extra days, This is not good news for your group,gives me 2 extra days fishing. I'm glad to hear everyone who fished the lac had a great time.2017 will be my 15th yr. in a row on this lac"
