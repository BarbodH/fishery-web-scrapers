By all accounts Dave was a really nice little lake and camp with some pretty good fishing!http://www.canadafishingguide.net/da...a-country-gem/I have two more lengthy stories to write on my most recent adventures - Miniss Lake with Slate Falls Outposts and Echoing Lake Camp in far NW Ontario (furthest north operating camp in the province).Both were great trips, and I now have roughly 3000 photos and 280 GB's of video to edit along with the writing."
