No preference Action We prefer action lakes with op for big pile. But walleye is preferred species. Our favourite lake had lots of 14- 17 inchers w the occasional plus 20 fish Boats: need to have swivel seats, power/size to match the lake ( re don't want to fish a huge lake in. 14 footer w a 9.9Cabins. Prefer an indoor toilet and shower w electricity (generator is fine)Think that's it lol. Thanks in advance for any replies Cheers Gordy"

The camp has boat rental using either 16 or 17 foot boats with a 40 hp Yamaha on the back. The lake is very easy to fish. The cabins are clean, ample bunks, showers, TV, complete kitchen set-up. The fish house and docks have been completely redone."
