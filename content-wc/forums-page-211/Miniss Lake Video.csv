5155346,v-bay gord,2016-10-16 09:07:00,3168,Great photography Mike. I believe I was at that location years ago when Barney Ogilvie owned it. Great coloration on the pike and walleye. Looks like a great destination ..........thanks!

5156058,elway12,2016-10-16 22:03:00,335,Another awesome video and destination Mike! A quick question: How many lodges/cabins are on that lake? Slate Falls has two? and Hidden Bay has one? Are there any others? Thanks.

I'd bet the guests don't venture into Miniss often though.There's also an outpost camp on Arc Lake, which is upstream of Miniss. I am not sure if Miniss is accessible from Arc, but it looks like it could be if someone really wanted to make the effort - there's definitely one good stretch of rapids you'd have to get through."
