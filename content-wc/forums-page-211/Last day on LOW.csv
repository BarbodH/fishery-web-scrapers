Saturday will be my last day of walleye hunting for this year. Hopefully the sun shines as forecast and the wind stays down. They have been on fire the past few weeks so I expect it will be good again. Only thing I can see that might stop another good bite is that my brother in law will be with me and he seems to be bad luck! Maybe it's time to change that!I am already counting the days till next spring and return to Lake of the Woods.

5158602,deadhead1,2016-10-18 07:37:00,193,My last day turned out to be a bit windy but still able to find a hot spot to get out of the wind and caught a lot of walleye. Kept a limit for the freezer for the first time this summer as we usually just keep what we are going to eat that day. Will taste good about December.
