5155866,Pooch,2016-10-16 18:56:00,4619,"Every year on our Canada trips we set the last evening trying to figure out who contributed what to the trip and how to fairly repay each member for their expenses incurred on behalf of the group.Our last trip of this past season I put together a simple Excel spreadsheet that was a work in progress, but now appears to be functioning for next years trip.Any thoughts for improvements? Anyone want a copy of it?Pooch"
5155946,phishfearme,2016-10-16 19:48:00,1242,"pooch - in our early trips, we did something very similar to what you are doing. it got INCREDIBLY frustrating and made for more acrimony and caused more problems than it solved. we actually have one ex-fisherman who will still not talk to some of the group. solution - find some single fool who will do everything - set the menu, buy the food, collect all money, buy everything en route (motels, food, etc.) - and on and on. then that one fool will summarize everything and balance out the money he collected. if you buy something for the group outside of the agreed to scope, it is something that you are contributing and will not be compensated for it - unless the other guys want to on their own. for our group that fool has been me - but in spite of the time it consumes, I think it's been worth it as there has been minimal if any problems since I started this. I don't relish the job but the thought of doing something else shakes me to the core. phish"
5156026,johnboat,2016-10-16 21:05:00,2014,"X2 Phish.10 - 12 in our group. I get a couple hundred per head and have a kitty. Out of that I send in deposits, buy groceries/ supplies, pay for hotel rooms, and pay for the gas. If need something or I forgot something someone runs to town with kitty money and makes purchase.Everyone is responsible for their own booze and mix. Or any other snack or whatever they can't do without. One guy goes no where with out a stash of pink strawberry waffers. Lol.End of week we get camp bill, I inspect it to make sure deposits were recorded properly divide total by numbers of guys..............done. Takes about 1 minute. Even Steven.........for everybody.We did the "" add up receipt thing"" once. Was one time to many. Conversions, wrinkled up receipts, lost receipts, ""oh here's another one I found"" (after lengthy process was over). Nice sheet tho. It might be ok for a 4 man group, but for larger groups in my experience, it's a nightmare."
5156042,grizzley,2016-10-16 21:20:00,2518,"We did exactly the same thing as jonboat when a bunch of us went on hunting trips. We had a kitty and we didn't feed it all at once, we put enough in to get started and added to it along the way. At the end of the trip whatever was left in the kitty got divied up between the guys. Never heard anyone complain about it, so it must have been considered fair."
5156074,Lmbkiller,2016-10-16 22:19:00,639,"I will say u guys pay waaaay too much for minnows. Buy them bulk in the states and salt them. We spent $28 on a half gallon of minnows, 6 of us used them every day, caught around 1400 fish for the week (no not every fish was on minnows) $260 is too much imo"
5156145,btyreprich,2016-10-17 03:57:00,1067,"For our group, I'm the fool that handles the hotel reservations and purchase off groceries. Have been doing this ever since we starting on housekeeping plan. About 60 or so days before we leave for our trip, I collect $150 per person for food. Every person on our trip supplies their own soda or beer. Whatever is left over from groceries goes into the gas fund. I myself don't mind doing the shopping and rather enjoy watching for sales & coming up with the menu. Our group likes to eat ""well"" on the trip. Having one person handle this task is a lot easier if you have a detailed grocery list and check off items as you buy them. Prevents the situation of thinking the other person will buy an item but does not."
5156282,Bstar,2016-10-17 06:07:00,564,"I am the ""Fool"" in our group! Everybody in the group pay for their share of the deposit upfront. I take care of everything else; food,bait, hotels, beer and booze, duty, meals,gas etc. and put it on my Cabela's card. After the trip I total everything up and divide it by the number in the group and everyone is fine with that. The only thing the guys need to pay for during the week is the balance to the camp/outfitter and any personal purchases. We used to do the kitty thing but that is a pain in the *ss. You have to carry a lot of cash with you, and it's harder to keep track. The guys like the current system and I don't mind doing it. That's why they call me the ""Camp Director""! Lol"
5156530,Twodogs,2016-10-17 09:27:00,115,"With our group of 6 to 8 guys, everyone contributes $ 50 for breakfast and extras for our fish fry which we have at lunch. Breakfast is usually eggs.... bacon... sausage... biscuits n gravy..and I'll buy oil.. breading... potatoes... beans.. taco shells cheese etc for lunch. We all bring our own boats up and each vehicle is responsible for their own gas up and back as well as motel rooms up and back. Everyone buys their own beer and booze. We split the lodge bill evenly between us allowing ice as the only extra item to be put on the bill. If someone wants to charge drinks at Lodge or use minnows that's on them. Each boat group is responsible for one dinner meal. Some guys smoke a shoulder and have pull pork sandwiches, other guys will make deer or duck wraps or chili. Been doing it this way for over 20 years and works great."
5156674,Bill Krejca,2016-10-17 10:37:00,6107,"As the title of the country song indicates, ""I'm Fool Number One"", or something like that. Few, if any ""committee purchases"". I buy, supply credit card on way up and back, roughly figure out total prior to splitting up at end of trip, collect fair share, and wait for the credit card statement. Left over $ get put back into kitty for next year. I buy most of food before trip, ask for $45 each several months before trip for food ( I look for sales, we still eat very well, but no prime rib, sirloin, etc, we like to eat fish each meal, along with a supplemental meat dish). Fresh grocery purchases day of arrival are included on credit card. Cabin expenses are individually paid, as are all ""personal needs/wants"" . Bill"

5157650,Pooch,2016-10-17 17:33:00,4619,"Those were ""made up"" numbers on my example spreadsheet, but last fall we did spend a huge amount on live minnows (and they were nice minnows). NOT worth it compared to how well the frozen minnows worked and will probably be the last time we buy so many ""live"" minnows.At least you are paying attention!!Pooch"
5158114,Golden Eagle,2016-10-17 21:34:00,2642,"Don't be bothered by your low number of trips. As you age you'll be able to build it up. I was sitting on that number myself, about 15 years ago. How do you handle catheters? Take a couple for the whole party or make each fisherman responsible only for his own? Actually my urologist convinced me to pack one and a tube of lubricant. So far we haven't had a need for it and when it happens I hope it's not for me."

You could always go visit Skywagon if you really miss the cold... He probably needs someone to split wood for him or should I say his wife does. He's probably out sneaking and peeking around trees looking for a moose while his poor wife is home splitting wood for the winter.Pooch"

It's been several years since. Maybe if Golden Eagle wasn't so far away he could come, too? One more and a deck of cards and we could really waste the day.Pooch"
5158794,Golden Eagle,2016-10-18 08:35:00,2642,"I typed two, pretty long, responses and lost both. Doubt if you missed much. Check Facebook page of Dave Clark, known as Trolldhl on WC. He's a guide on Dale Hollow Lake, that's about a 40 mile ride from my house. When you open his Facebook page, click on his name (Dave Clark) (Dale Hollow Dave) until you reach the page with a guy holding a nice musky at the top of the page. Scroll back all the way to September to view his catches of walleyes, catfish, and sm. He's had an impressive September and half of October. Dale Hollow Lake holds fish and Dave Clark finds them by trolling lots of lines at various depths. I need to take time away from planning Canada trips, traveling roundtrip to Red Lake and hunting walleyes & pike so I can learn to fish Dale Hollow Lake. Yesterday I put together a party of 6 for the May 20, 2017 Ontario walleye opener. Three of us will arrive a few days early for pike fishing and might even butcher a couple of 26"" pike."

5159602,Golden Eagle,2016-10-18 20:09:00,2642,"Would really like meeting the two of you, but it would be a pretty good drive on this end."
5157610,Pooch,2016-10-17 17:15:00,4619,"Over the years we have used some variation of all the above suggestions. Depends on the group and how they want to do things.To me, the best is to let one guy make a menu and after everyone agrees he will do all the supply buying for the group. Our group usually has a couple guys who have a favorite meal that everyone looks forward to and that will be factored into the menu in advance.Since one of our Lac Seul trips involves three boats with two guys in each boat and all from a different locations around Illinois meeting up at the hotel in Canada the night before we arrive at camp I decided to try to split the ""group"" costs fairly so no one is left ""holding the bag"" when the trip is over. Some guys have access to a great locker for meats while others have a bait shop that will work with them on larger quantities or multiple trip customers thus the sharing of costs needs to be split up. Thus a spreadsheet to make keeping track easier. Get a deal on something the group can split? Turn it in and get reimbursed fairly.Remember the old adage ""that good fences make good neighbors?"". Everyone on the trip getting reimbursed for what they spent makes for a happy bunch of friends.If you look at my worksheet you will see that it is extremely simple, easy to understand and fair to all.There is not ""perfect"" system and most guys, including me, are not counting penny's when fishing with our buddies. I (we) just want to go fishing together. Sharing cost evenly is part of being fair to everyone.When the most pressing question every morning is where are we headed and who has the bait? Then everyone must be happy with how the trip is going. That is always a goal.I hate this time of year (as far as fishing) because it will be a long time until next June arrives and I can once again head north. My next trip will be number sixty two for me. I can remember every one, who I was with and most of the time a few highlights. When I am in Canada with friends I think I am at my most content and at peace with the world. Hope everyone else can say the same.Pooch"
