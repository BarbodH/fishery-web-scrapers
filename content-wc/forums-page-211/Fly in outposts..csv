1637770,stillangling,2013-04-04 20:32:00,149,"I spent some of my younger years living in northeastern Ontario. Sudbury was one of the spots where I lived. Fished as much water as time would allow while I was there. I would be cautious of any recommendation for lakes in that area, especially from someone logged in as a guest and just happens to provide a link. I now live in NW Ontario and can state with confidence that the walleye fisheries in the northeast cannot compare with those in the northwest (on average). The fishing just keeps getting better as you go west. There is a band of walleye water that starts around Nakina and runs west to the Manitoba border that is as good as you can find anywhere. It is not by chance that the vast majority of lakes discussed on this site fall into this area."
5158962,033recon,2016-10-18 10:29:00,21,I will fly out with Lee for as long as he is there. We have really good luck on Fawcett lake. X2 for Pickeral Arm!
5159714,Crackback,2016-10-19 01:08:00,257,"I AGREE WITH YOU 500%. If you are going East of White River, Ontario all the way to Quebec to fish walleye, pike or smallmouth expecting even reasonable success, you are wasting your fishing and recreational dollars. Those waters have been hammered to death for the last 40 years and the chance of it coming back is slim to none. What you have said about fishing the Northwest Ontario and Manitoba region is so spot on even a caveman could understand it. I would say the location band you speak of for exceptional fishing, runs a line north from Thunder Bay to Nakina and goes West all the way to Saskatchewan. If you are fishing East of that line you are catching smaller fish (on average) and in lesser quantities. That Algoma area from Wawa to Timmins has to be the center of the worst fishing in Ontario and the French River area is not far behind. Who is to blame you ask? Access to those lakes previously not accessible has been opened up by unrestricted logging interests. Every Tom, Dick , and Harry and their brothers with a 14 foot boat and 9.9 motor is pounding those lakes without mercy and have been since the early 1980s and late 1970s. You can deny it with the NIBY ( Not in My backyard) attitude and say it hasn't happened to my lake, but the undeniable facts remain. Guys fishing Northwest Ontario are having way more success and catch more and better quality fish than those folks fishing Eastern Ontario and the price, other than driving further, is equal or even less. i wouldn't waste my time fishing Eastern Ontario if the trip costs were free."
5160122,phishfearme,2016-10-19 08:25:00,1242,"crackback and stillangling - as I mentioned in a previous post on this thread, our group spent many years fishing in northeast Ontario and left the area due to the reasons you summarize. we have found wonderful success in the northwest and our worst days in the northwest were better than our best days in the northeast. however, ""fishing success"" is relative - there is a step increase in fishing quality and quantity coming from northeast to northwest Ontario - AND - there is a step increase in quality and quantity going from most all the US States to northeast Ontario. so, I guess it all get's down to your expectations - you can find many very positive reports here in Canada Eh? of people doing trips in the northeast. they all had excellent trips and I guess that's what's most important. phish"
5160378,Crackback,2016-10-19 11:54:00,257,"Not necessarily....I can go to Saginaw Bay, Lake Erie and/or the Detroit Rive and catch more and bigger fish any day of the week and twice on Sunday as compared to North East Ontario. Your comparison between Northeast Ontario and Saginaw Bay, Detroit River and Lake Erie is highly flawed. Have you ever fished those 3 waters lately? IF you are looking for the Northeast Ontario ambiance and Canadian adventure experience, with golf, and all those other non fishing opportunities, then knock yourself and your checkbook out on going there. But if you want the same thing with bigger and more fish of all species..GO WEST YOUNG MAN, GO WEST!!!"

It has been quite a few years since I have been to Sportsman's, I can tell you Bret and his Wife are super people. their attention to detail is second to none. They have been in the resort business a long time. The lake is very nice in size (if I am remembering right just it is over 12000 acres) separated into 2 sections with river inlets and outlets. There is quite a few nice islands and some really nice bays with streams running into or out of the lake. The lake is a dark stained lake with a shallow depth, 15 to 20 ft. if I remember right. Lots of weed beds that are fish magnets! If your after pike numbers this is not the lake to go to. If you want big pike this lake is outstanding! The walleye fishing is fast. My dad and I caught over 350 our first trip there. The average size 16 to 17. I remember the third year we went to LV, dad did catch and release a 30 inch eye. I pulled my map out of the lake the memories return! Mike Borger is right, golden Eagle knows LV so well he could almost call it his own!"

1637730,phishfearme,2013-04-04 20:01:00,1242,my group spent many enjoyable years north of sudbury at ray's camps and other lakes including bisco and indian - from 1972 to 1989. we've flown with sudbury aviation before and they provide excellent service - no problems there. we left the sudury area back in 1989 as the fishing pressure became too much not to mention the increase in access - water skiers with 125hp motors up in cat bay (ramsey lake) did it for us. we now go to flyin lakes in NW ontario and can get a huge lake all to ourselves with no other cabins/lodges and no other access. this just can't be said for the larger lakes north of sudbury. the larger lakes are accessible by roads - legally or otherwise. hardly need a plane to get to bisco lake. so it gets down to what you are looking for - privacy can be achieved at their small lakes but small lakes typically do not produce larger fish and the small lakes may bore you after a few days. hammer handle pike are the norm at these smaller lakes and many do not offer walleye as walleye are not native to the spanish river system. at least they offer multiple lake weeks - a good idea. just my opinion based on experience. phish

There are too many to mention them all but Air Ivanhoe, Hearst Air, are the two that come to mind immediately. Both great options with different specialties. Air Ivanhoe has a ton of lakes with lots of variety in the quality of accomadations, Hearst Air has some phenomenal fishing with an air base that isn't quite as luxurious. I have been to fishing shows where 80% of all of the fly-ins are less than $1000.00 bucks. I've always considered anything more than that to be ""high end""."

Going to one of the best walleye lakes we have ever fished and the price is $1000 and that includes the taxes. So there are still some good trips out there that don't cost an arm and a leg.

I have also fished Sportsmans Lodge on Little Vermillion three times and for big pike and lots of walleye it is a great lake with great people that operate it. It is also under 1000.00 for the week.

1228857,SinOrSwim,2010-08-18 17:50:00,1528,"TO CLARIFY my original post. I didn't say you could NOT find one, but I would be skeptical since we have been going for 14 or 15 years and they were above the $800. price, even back then. However, we have found a comfort zone with the outfitter and the lake we go to and would not change to save a few hundred dollars. Just our opinion. We do have indoor plumbing and showers etc so that could be why ours cost more. I would pay the extra to NOT crap in a mosquito filled hole. Again, just my opinion. That is what is great about this forum. First hand experience from a lot of people and a lot of great information."

There is nothing fancy about the cabins,we are not there to relax in a cabin,we are there to fish,no matter the weather. 10-11hrs on the lake,cook your meals,a drink or 2 and in bed.The operation has been bought by someone from Wisconsin and Chad seemed as conscious about running the same operation as before.

It is a little longer of a drive than than going to Northwest Ontario but in my opinion it was well worth a few extra hours in the car. For us the drive to Flin Flon is about 21 hours which isn't too bad considering it takes me 18hours to get to Red Lake. I've been to a wide range of resorts in Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatchwan and in my opinion you can't beat the quantity and quality of the fish at Kississing, especially for the price."

Just like in other areas, you get what you pay for. Last thing you want to do is go on the cheap and find out nothing works when you get there. It's expensive to fly people in and maintain, boats, motors, solar and gas appliances. We've been going for 14 or 15 years now and would recommend either Slate Falls Outposts or Red Pine Lodge, both out of Sioux Lookout. It will NOT fall into your price range though. However, the cabins and the fishing are top notch. Leaving later this week actually."

If you're looking for five star accom. then they are right, but if you are ok with a newer ownership lodge with good equipment and nice housekeeping accom. and good fishing then it is possible. Check out Brace Lake Outfitters out of Nakina, On. They are a class act. The fishing is very good with 3-lakes to fish. I have no affiliation other than a satisfied customer that can't wait to get back with my 7 other fishing-hunting buddies in 10 days from now.I even had the wife there a few years ago for a separate week and she wants to go again, Kyle and Teri Polesky are sure to make your vacations a memorable one.

1228632,SinOrSwim,2010-08-18 05:39:00,1528,"My bad. I do have a question though. How can you have a housekeeping plan if it's a fly-in? Or is it a drive-in on a very remote lake? Which, if he was looking to have the experience of a float plane would make a difference.Cabins look nice. Wooden boats would be interesting. One thing I forgot to mention which certainly isn't a deal breaker but it's quite nice. We have stayed at cabins that have wooden dock/walkway from the dock to the cabin and we have stayed at places that do not. The amount of cleaning is drastically reduced. You don't have dirt and sand being brought into the cabin or the boats all week. Like I said, not a deal breaker but a nice benefit."
