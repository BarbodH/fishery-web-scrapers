5140137,The tank,2016-10-04 16:00:00,340,I just think if someone is targeting smallmouth only they probly would be disappointed in that area. Your just not going to catch as many as alot of other lakes. Of all the lakes I've fished for walleye and smallmouth that area for smallies is on the bottom and for walleyes it's on the top. That's just what we've found.

5136914,Musky Magic,2016-10-02 08:05:00,3,I'm looking for a different lake/lodge option for smallmouth that is within 100 miles of Kenora - I have my own boat and I've been fishing LOTW and Shoal for years - looking for something different. Any recommendations would be appreciated.

5137681,The tank,2016-10-02 19:39:00,340,If he's wanting smallmouth that end of Lac seul is probly not what hes looking for. I would say that the north west end of rainy lake is about as good as any place for smallies. Labells is a great camp. Or we've done well in the English river and winnipeg river north of kenora. There's good smallmouth fishing at the east end of Lac suel.

5137890,Crackback,2016-10-03 02:19:00,257,"Labelle's is a great place and has TV and internet and you can go into Ft Francis easily. Camp Narrows is good too but it is 5 mile boat in without TV and internet connections, but is 2-3 miles closer to prime fishing spots, but is double the price. If I ever went back to Rainey Lake , I would go to Labelle's. A 2-3 mile run is nothing at 35mph. There is tons of smallmouth, walleye, and BIg northern fishing all over the Northwest arm of Rainey Lake at LaBelles. I had 50 walleye days on Rainey and popped 5 Northerns at at 38-40 inches as we weren't really fishing for them."
5138825,prov1800,2016-10-03 16:29:00,5010,If you want bass and i suggest clarkes norther lughts resort on cedar lake.great population of bass.and since you have your own boat you could pull it out and teailer it overcto cluff lake for a say ir two there.couple of miles from camp.wont be sorry.
