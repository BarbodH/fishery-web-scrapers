5149905,stabbert,2016-10-11 19:09:00,7,Good fishing on Lac Seul! Always wanted to make a trip to Lac Seul Outposts. Have stayed at Country Camping and Moosehorn in the past. Do you see many individuals in that camp coming up there to do much Musky fishing? From my understanding that is at least one section of Lac Seul where there are some monsters.
5150098,Lmbkiller,2016-10-11 23:30:00,639,"1800fish/5 guys=360fish per guy. 360fish per guy/5 days=72fish per guy per day. Obviously it's very good fishing and it is tough to beat lac seul avg size. However, I don't think it's a secret that on some fly in lks those numbers can be doubled. Again, 72 fish per guy per day is still excellent fishing and certainly not easy to accomplish"
5150282,tv4fish,2016-10-12 06:51:00,2694,"OK - I want to know HOW you know that ??? Are you guys weighing each fish and writing that down? Quote: We then each have a bunch of pennies, nickels and dimes. One penny in the jug for an under slot fish, one nickel for a slot fish and one dime for an over the slot fish. Makes record keeping easier and much more accurate. You guys must start out with HEAVY pockets. Our (my) method is mucher simpler - 3 lap counters mounted on the side of the boat - 1 for under slot - 1 for in slot - 1 for over slot. Every time a fish is caught - just a simple matter of tapping the correct counter. At the end of the day, we just write the numbers in our log book - next morning - reset the counters to zero."
5150522,Golden Eagle,2016-10-12 09:07:00,2642,"All numbers are estimates, probably accurate within a ton or so. Closest I've witnessed to a true count was one May as I led my party of 6 through broken ice and up stream in a river, stopping above mild rapids. Three of the six were new to the lake and new to our party. I overheard one guy mention (intended for my ears), ""Let's see how big a liar Golden Eagle is when he suggests we could catch 100 walleyes a day."" An hour later the two had boated over 100 walleyes when they lost count. Several big pike also ate our jigs. We were fishing a point a few years ago, jigging for walleyes and occasionally hooking onto a big pike when 4 guys (2 boats) anchored and began fishing dead bait. Between them they boated a big pike (38""-44"") about every 10 minutes. Their success at catching was greater than their care of the fish as they netted them with a cheap net causing slim to be removed, allowed them to touch the boat floor and kept them out of the water much too long. I haven't weighed a fish in over 40 years. I also have not removed a big pike from the water in several years. Any measuring is done with my marked rod. Pike goes into my huge Frabil net, hook is released while fish is in the net and net is lowered so fish can swim away. Pike is unharmed and happy. I've never been a fish counter. Back in 1979, I took Eddie Watson and Grady Webb, a pair of 74 year old fishing friends to a NW Ontario lake. Eddie has two grandsons, Mack Brown and Watson Brown, who are well known football coaches. Eddie kept a diary of every fish caught. At dinner time Grady would show up and brag about out fishing Eddie 52 - 46 on walleyes. Right behind him Eddie would mentioned that he caught 63 pike to Grady's 51 pike. That diary is probably still around and I'd like to check it. Numbers might have improved if time hadn't been eaten up by recording catches."
5150722,SinOrSwim,2016-10-12 12:15:00,1528,"LOL accurate to within ""a ton or so"". hahahahah That made me laugh. But, 7000lbs of walleye? That is 2333 fish if they average 3lbs. If everyone really catches these numbers........it's becoming very clear I SUCK at fishing. No way I come close to these numbers whether we flew in or not."
5150762,maddogg,2016-10-12 12:49:00,178,Those sound like Trump numbers.
5150866,Golden Eagle,2016-10-12 13:43:00,2642,"Making 32 consecutive walleye openers on the same hot lake has produced great catching success for me, especially when a late spring made walleye fishing legal before the spawn was finished. Tracking walleyes from the spawning site to the main lake is usually productive. Pike find walleyes and I offer pike my JSM and suicks. My ideal walleye opener is spending 3 weeks in camp, including a new moon and a full moon. 2017 walleye opener in NW Ontario is May 22. New moon is May 25. I'll be there. I won't be counting or weighing fish. An early spring could have walleyes already in the lake, on the move, scattered and hard for me to find. I might be working hard to boat a dozen small to medium walleyes a day, but I doubt it."
5147881,milfish,2016-10-10 11:52:00,249,"We just returned from another great trip to Lac Seul Outposts in Chamberlain Narrows. As usual, Ken and Brenda Robbins were terrific hosts and they saw to our every need. Over the years they have become more than just Hosts, and are truly considered to be good friends. Sam and Betty were very pleasant and helpful, and Kirk is one of the best dock hand/helpers we've ever had. He was at the dock when we returned every day, helped carry gear, and had a warm fire going in the cabin every evening when we returned for the days' fishing. Always plenty of ice for our coolers and firewood for our comfort.Saturday, 10-01 was 70 degrees and dead flat with bluebird sunny skies. We found fish from 18 to 26 feet and 3/8 or 1/2 oz. chrome plated strobe jigs tipped with a minnow was the choice that day. Chartreuse and pink also worked but by far most fish came on the Chrome Plated strobe jigs. When the sun went away, we switched to the Gold Plated Strobe jigs and they outfished the silver. Sunday Monday and Tuesday were all about the same weather with a total of about 1200 walleyes for 2 boats and 5 guys. The biggest was 28 3/4 inches with a 27 1/2, 26 1/2, a numerous fish in the 25 inch range. All in all, 1800 total for the trip with 30% in the slot, 30% over the slot and 40% short. Never an issue getting our lunch 16 inchers. Wednesday was windy and rain and a bit tuff fishing the spots we like. And Thursday was decent and by Friday the wet snow arrived and was a bit unpleasant but very fishable.Already counting down next falls trip and also considering a late spring early summer trip if there is an opening in camp.Hope this is helpful.Milfish."
5148769,The tank,2016-10-10 19:56:00,340,Awsome report. Sound like an awsome trip.
5149073,jimirjr,2016-10-11 06:18:00,1149,"My group was there 9/10 - 9/17... Camp was awesome, owners (Ken and Brenda) and staff awesome, Kirk was awesome ! Fishing was, well, awesome, too. Booked for next year !!"
5149097,Guest,2016-10-11 06:54:00,0,So how many did you get 1200 or 1800?
5149449,milfish,2016-10-11 11:08:00,249,"1200 by days end on Tuesday 1797 by days end Friday. Great trip, already making plans for the same week next year. 20 plus years!"
5149537,wooglin,2016-10-11 12:24:00,371,"How on earth did you keep track of those numbers, between 5 guys and 2 boats? I've heard of 100 fish days per boat, but never 1,800 fish in a week. Wow, must have been jumping in your boat!"
5149577,spurs101,2016-10-11 13:29:00,635,Did you need to travel far for good walleye?
5149673,SinOrSwim,2016-10-11 15:26:00,1528,How many hours a day does a person have to fish to catch that many fish? I assume A LOT! Even if you fished 10hr/day for the whole 7 days that is over 5 fish per hour per person.
5149729,milfish,2016-10-11 16:03:00,249,"We are on the water by 9:00 every morning and fish until 1:30, break for shore lunch until 3:00. Back on the water from 3:00 until 6:45 each day. We then each have a bunch of pennies, nickels and dimes. One penny in the jug for an under slot fish, one nickel for a slot fish and one dime for an over the slot fish. Makes record keeping easier and much more accurate. In years past we've had years that we had 500 fish per man per week. That's when we were young and fished from dawn to dusk no break for anything more than a sandwich in the boat and no need to go to shore to answer mother natures calling as often that comes with age. L.O.L.! We also keep pretty good track of wind direction, outdoor and water temps and compare to previous trips. I'm not saying that we're getting good at this but 20 years fishing the same spots the same time of the year does help."
5149889,Golden Eagle,2016-10-11 18:31:00,2642,"In a good week our party of 6 will boat in the neighborhood of 2 1/2 tons of pike and 3 1/2 tons of walleyes. Strong wind might keep us off the water a day or so, which would subtract from our totals. We usually hit the water around 9:00 a.m. and meet at the fish cleaning house at 9:00 p.m. to clean walleyes for our dinner. No shore lunches. Age is beginning to hamper my success."
