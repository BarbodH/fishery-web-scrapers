5118857,Shortline,2016-09-19 18:44:00,234,"First of all, that is a heck of a catch for walleye tackle. I'll bet it was exciting as can be on that light tackle. Congrats, as that is an awesome catch! From my experience with bigger lakers, I have found that most people call a 36"" trout a 20# fish. I have heard it countless times. From the 75+ trout I have had in my boat in the 35-36"" range, I can honestly say I have not verified a true 20 that was under 36"", ever. A 36"" fish usually was in that 17-19lb range. Not to say a 36"" couldn't weight that, but I haven't seen it. I would estimate your trout as somewhere in the 15-18lb range and if I were betting cash on it, I would put money on it being an honest 16-17 lbs - which in real weights is a heck of a nice Ontario fish for a drive to water. Once again - congrats. I wish I could have been there to see the fight! SL"

5137929,Lake Of The Woods,2016-10-03 03:49:00,124,Here's your 40 pounder just for comparison purposes.
5137937,Smoke_N_Finn,2016-10-03 04:01:00,437,"Here is mine not even 30#, I think there is a difference.https://uploads.tapatalk-cdn.com/2016...e816ee1ba7.jpgBut nice fishSent from my XT1254 using Tapatalk"
5116177,NARDA 1,2016-09-18 07:07:00,636,"I caught this on 9/11/16 on Eagle Lake while fishing with great friends Ernie Bruetsch and Scott Staak. We were jigging for Walleye in Portage Bay. I was using my regular spinning rig with 8lb test and a Lindy Rig and minnow. 35 inches, approx 40 lbs."
5116473,Guest,2016-09-18 10:06:00,0,40 lbs?????!!!!!!
5116609,fishinnut 3446,2016-09-18 12:15:00,638,Holy CHIT Terry that's a hog !
5116617,fishinnut 3446,2016-09-18 12:16:00,638,How deep you guy's fishing ?
5117169,Crackback,2016-09-18 22:19:00,257,"I hate to burst your bubble , but that fish isn't even close to 40 pounds...."
5117361,Bill Krejca,2016-09-19 06:42:00,6107,"Regardless of the weight, that is a very nice fish! Bill"
5117369,v-bay gord,2016-09-19 06:42:00,3168,"In Canada we often refer to a 40 ounce bottle of whisky as a ""40 pounder"". Perhaps Narda is referring to this? Agreed though, a very nice fish regardless."
5118113,123chadder,2016-09-19 11:30:00,429,"might not be 40lbs,but shes a bruiser!"
5118545,NARDA 1,2016-09-19 15:47:00,636,"40 lbs was an estimate by the person that was handling the net and has spent 60+ years on Eagle, as we didn't have a scale. I wish we did because I would really like to know what the actual weight was. It was a blast catching it and I was with 2 great friends which makes for a great memory."
5118697,Sportdog,2016-09-19 17:00:00,6735,That is a beautiful laker that would tip the scales at 22-24 pounds. Nice catch and congrats!
