I have heard good things in general but was hoping for a review from 2016 or2015. I know they are known as a good pike destination but has anyone been lately? Thanks, B-"

The cabins and lodge are homey but are heated with toilets, electric and showers. Its a great pike lake. Last year we had sustained high winds all week making fishing and traveling across lake challenging.I managed to get only 1 fish over 40"". We did catch lots 34 and above, but we were looking for masters class pike. The walleye fishing is outstanding. Jerry had a spot in June open up next year so I tried to get a commitment from the guy I went with the last 2 years and tie a Dunlops trip on the back of our annual fly in. Unfortunately my friend has a conflict and by the time I requested a solo trip for that week, it had been filled. PM me if you would like more info. I'm going to miss Lake Waskaiowaka next year!"
