Fall fishing is indeed more than just getting fish, it is the complete fall experience. We hit Cedar last week, staying at Cedar Point, crappies being the main target. We did very well on crappies, finding them in many places, always deep, as they are this time of year. 18- 22 feet seemed to be the depth they preferred, depth sounder helped in finding them. The first 3 days, it rained fairly steadily,but little wind the entire week, finally saw the sun on Friday. With a starting water temp of 60, dropping to about 58 degrees when we left, plastics and a little jig I had created some 40 years ago were the hot baits. We used no live bait the entire week. We did not get a pile of walleyes, being satisfied with those we picked up ""by accident"", fishing crappies. Using my jig,which I had immodestly named ""Krejca's Killer"", folks in my boat also pulled in ""by accident"" a 3lb and 4lb smallmouth, hooked 2 muskies and landed one, a 30 incher, not a monster, but a very beautiful fish, all being released. Largest walleye for the week was a very fat 24 incher. We also picked up a few pike and perch, no monsters of either, but still fun. To reiterate a previous post, crappies, and walleyes, have a tendency to get the bends when brought up from deep water. For crappies, deep water can be 20 feet or more. I discovered many moons ago, a method to safely return almost all of them from whence they come. It requires a sort of strange procedure, not exactly sure why it works, but I'll repeat for those interested. If the fish is released by gently placing back in the water, deep water hooked fish will probably float, the bladder having been pushed up toward the mouth. The secret is to actually throw them into the water, an achieved height of perhaps 6 feet or so usually seems required. It seems rather disrespectful, but believe it or else, it works. They hit the water with a splash, and with a quick flip of their tail shoot back down, almost a work of art just seeing it. Try it, you'll love it! I brought up my GMG smoker, and smoked some fat back crappies, brown sugar/salt, 8/1, 2 hours at 180 degrees. They came out very good, and traded our next door neighbors smoked fish for home made bread, everyone wins! Several items come to mind which I always bring up, and which I don't believe I mentioned on other threads, and which should be considered, no matter where you stay, so I'll share while I'm thinking of it: extra light bulbs, a clamp-on light for the stove top, inside extension cords- heavy for cooking utensils - lighter for other stuff, a variety of different electrical plugs for multiple plug-ins. Getting back to the trip report - all in all, it was a much fun time, my son saying it was the best trip yet (and he's been on many). Great companions, great hosts, great eating, beautiful scenery of yellow and gold and red and green, clean air, abundant wild life - partridge, fox, ducks, geese, pileated woodpeckers, otters, loons, pine squirrels, beaver, deer, colored clouds, I am the luckiest guy in the world! And the fishing wasn't all that bad, either! )) Bill"

Thanks for the report....had me again wishing I was back up on the water at Cedar, and exchanging some excellent Ohio cheese and Trail Bologna (it's a regional favorite in this area) for some of your smoked fish (ha).

5143730,prov1800,2016-10-06 18:36:00,5010,Totally agree breezy.ive always put posts on here when fish start going deep.ive seen some floating but a lot stay down.i never fish deeper than 25'.makes me feel better.walleyes will go down healthy in that depth.but i have noticed over tge last 10 years that the crappues we have in canada are not very durable.when i fish for them i just keep them.when i have my limit ill go fish for something else.not going to kill a bunch of fish.
5143882,Bill Krejca,2016-10-06 20:46:00,6107,"We know the result when the lake is covered with floating fish which never made it down. I'd be interested in any data collected on the mortality of the fish released as I indicated. I would think the area would be covered by carcasses in a day or two, too numerous for the eagles to devour. If they really later die (due to release), I'd have to rethink my thesis.This would truly be a great study by an enterprising biologist to dig into. Thanks for the comments, something to think about. How about it, biologists? Bill"
5143898,prov1800,2016-10-06 21:08:00,5010,I know a biologist (retired)in the kenora district.Gord Pyzer.i have talked to him on a number of occasions.he does agree about the mortality.i have seen fish floating personally.especially in the summer when i see guys fishing at 40 ft.have seen it on cedar to.but i have thrown the crappues back as you described and yes somecrakevoff.some instantly lay on there side.they all slowly die in my big livewell to.walleyes survive.i dont need to fish deep to catch fish so i make a point of never doing it.just makes me feel better.and i just catch and keep crappies as we get them.during july they seemed even more vulnerable to a release and they were atvthe same depth as they are now.in the winter when we catch them through the ice They really seem to take off real healthy but we just mainly keep what ever comes up.the spots i fish on cedar in winter are 18-20 ft.lors of them but i know all the deep spirs to but just dont go to them much.but ifcwe do its a catch and keep deal.they have spread everywhere buf not much further west yet.to bad we didnt meet up.was close.maybe next year.
5144202,Bill Krejca,2016-10-07 06:50:00,6107,"Hi again, John. Not to keep beating a dead horse (crappie?), but the reason I shared my release plan was to help, not to recommend killing more fish. I don't fish deep for walleyes, so this isn't an issue for me. In other previous posts over the years,, I shared what I thought was an unsafe depth for crappies to be returned, observing that 22-23 ft or deeper seemed to be a fairly normal not returnable depth. I believe it depends on the day, and the barometric pressure (just a guess, not being either a weatherman nor a biologist) You can tell before landing if the fish will make it by their faint struggle on the way up from that. or deeper depth, also the fish will attain a still appearance in its eye, fairly easy to spot. These fish need to be kept. To get a video appearance of what I am talking about, check out any of several ice-fishing you tubes showing deep caught crappies for the camera (before release), these were destined to die. Again, I am not a biologist, just an ol' line wetter(not bed wetter..yet) who had observed some stuff during my 78 years. Have a great year, perhaps we'll meet up next year. Bill"
