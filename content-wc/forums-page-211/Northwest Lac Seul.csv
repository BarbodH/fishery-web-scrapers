5061233,fishingMN4eyes,2016-08-15 14:50:00,108,"Came home Saturday after four full days of fishing and an evening on Monday.Dealt with wind most everyday. Not enough wind to blow us off the lake, but enough to make boat control a bit of an adventure at times. Rained a little bit on Tuesday and late in the afternoon on Friday just as we were starting to call it quits, but the rain didn't seem to affect the fishing. There was really no magical depth for us. We caught fish as shallow as 8' and as deep as 28'. It really depended on the spot we were at. We used mostly 3/8oz jigs and minnows were noticeably more productive than crawlers most days. Again, there really wasn't a magical jig color, either. Earlier in the week it seemed like darker colored jigs were working and by the end it was lighter colors. My brother had a lot of luck fishing Smile Blades on a couple spots, caught some real quality size on those things too.We made two runs down to McKenzie and stayed closer to home the other two days fishing around camp and Steamboat. Overall I'd say the quality/size of the fish was better in McKenzie than up north closer to camp but we still caught fish just about everywhere we went. Lots of slot fish and plenty of overs were caught. I caught a 27"" on the last day(last spot even) and that was the big walleye in our group."
5140833,fishmanric,2016-10-05 06:50:00,219,Wow! Great reports but sounds like boat traffic could be a problem. Booked with Lac Seul Floating lodges for July 2nd - 9th next year. This will be my first experience fishing Lac Seul. I myself if encroached upon will move and find another spot. Who wants to fish in Canada like back in the states. Looking at my Navionics chip there seems to be a million spots to fish in this huge body of water.
5140849,pjshorthorn,2016-10-05 06:54:00,5654,Send me a PM if you would like some info. on areas to try in the NE section of the lake. How far up the lake do you plan on taking the HB? PjShorthorn
5034105,fishingMN4eyes,2016-08-02 08:03:00,108,Heading up net week. Any reports or updates to share? Thanks in advance!
5034665,rather-be-fishin,2016-08-02 12:18:00,429,"We just returned from Lac Seul on July 30 fishing mostly McKenzie Bay, Bay of Islands, and south of Manitoba point. The fishing for walleyes was good to excellent! The walleyes were mostly in 20 to 27 feet of water. We fished off of island points and reefs. Still fishing with jigs or trolling. Mostly used jigs and minnows and some spinners. Jigs in a light yellow or chartreuse color seem to work the best 1/4 to 3/8 ounce. We caught many Walleye ranging from 15 inches up to 2 - 28 inchers. Many Walleye in the 22-25 inch range. We had several fresh walleye dinners while there and had no problem filling out our limits of walleye freezer fish. It was good to see a large amount of walleyes from 15 to 18 inch class. We did not target northerns. Our largest northern was 30 inches. This was our 13th year fishing Lac Seul. We did, however, experience the worst time of other multiple boats moving in and fishing right next to you and anchoring right in your trolling path. Or dropping an anchor within 10 yards of your boat. I have heard about this happening on the lake, but never have seen it or experienced it to this extreme. It was just like fishing in Minnesota. The other boaters did not care even if you said something to them they had no intentions of moving. So we just gave up and kept fishing. Sad that you travel hundreds of miles to fish in the wilderness on a lake 150 miles long and people can't find their own spot to fish. The weather was great and we had a fantastic time with family and friends and the countdown is on for our return trip next year. RBF"
5034729,fishingMN4eyes,2016-08-02 13:59:00,108,"Thanks for the report! We make lots of runs to McKenzie when we are there. Sorry to hear about the boats moving in on you. We've had some of those kind in our years on Lac Seul as well, very frustrating!"
5035241,Lmbkiller,2016-08-02 19:32:00,639,"After a boat with mn registration came within 15yds of us idling for 200yds after coming from who knows where, I asked them, ""hey, we're having lunch, wanna join us?"" It was 3:30pm. As far as I'm concerned it was inconsiderate at the very best. What a bunch of ****. The lk is 140mi long, go figure out your own game. Hope that wasn't u rbf. I agree that this was the worst I've seen with boats encroaching. Come on people, go find your own fish"
5035457,Guest,2016-08-02 20:39:00,0,"Was fishing LS 7/24-7/30 Water temps 68-72 degrees Fished McKenzie, Bay of Islands, Ghost Narrows and Manatoba Point areas. Caught walleye 8'-24' with the most productive depths of 18-22' Used spinners on bottom bouncers for walleye with minnows. Reefs seemed to produce the most fish. Biggest walleye was 24"" and northern 36"" 2 times had boats ""join"" me and was frustrating when they would fish a different way and interfere in my trolling of spinners. GO AWAY! Freaking lake is HUGE and many places to fish. Guess it's time to start chunking LARGE SPOONS when they show up.... Enjoy the great fishing... I'll be back in Sept"
5035601,Lmbkiller,2016-08-02 21:37:00,639,I was down that way....never saw a boat fish ghost all week. Sometimes saw as many as 8 boats fish small island in Mckenzie west of ghost (all at once). 2 different times had 1 or more boats come from as far as eye could see and pull up rite on our ****......I guess everyone is having the same problem
5035737,rather-be-fishin,2016-08-02 22:55:00,429,"Lmbkiller - It wasn't me who moved in on you or anyone else .... I would never do that! We get up early to get to our favorite spots before others. We were the first ones to this spot. The boats that moved in on us were from MN, Iowa & Wisconsin. I have a bright fluorescent yellow shirt that has HUGE print on it that says ""If you can read my shirt, your fishing too close"". I put it on & they didn't care! This one boat was from Duluth & motored to this spot every day from Evergreen resort & fished in the same spot all day and all week! We had a group of 4 boats & sometimes we all fished together. Then another day 2 of our 4 group boats were anchored & the other 2 were trolling a point off an island. A boat came an anchored right next to our 2 other boats were anchored right in our trolling path. So our group boat that was trolling, kept trolling the same path close by the boat that moved in on us. That boat then pitched jigs right at our groups boat. No fishing etiquette or courtesy at all. Our group of 4 also fished that small island West of Ghost Narrows. I guess they see 4 boats together so think it's a free for all?!?!?!"
5035809,btyreprich,2016-08-03 04:13:00,1067,"Had a buddy whose dad would cast a large spoon / Daredevele at boats which were getting too close to his boat. More than once the lure would bounce off the side of the ""intruder"" . That's all it took to drive that person away. Funny to think about - sad that it has to take place on a lake as large as Lac Seul."
5036209,fishingMN4eyes,2016-08-03 08:12:00,108,"Right, just because there are multiple boats on a spot doesn't mean you can/should invite yourself in. We always go up with a 2 boat group. Sometimes we fish together and other times we split up. I often wonder if people see us fishing together and assume it's all good to just barge on in."
5040778,fishingMN4eyes,2016-08-05 07:41:00,108,Bump. Leaving Monday.
