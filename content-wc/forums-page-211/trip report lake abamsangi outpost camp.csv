Very basic setup that meets your needs with the potential for a few minor snags. I think a lot even prefer that type of arrangement.As for the Hot'nTot, that's a fast action lure. Best suited for warmer temps. One my go-to lures for trolling, along with the Thinfin. I probably own at least 100 Hot'nTots.Still wonder about the rest of their outposts though."
5142098,Rich B,2016-10-05 20:07:00,1081,"Wolf, Thanks for the report....sounds like you and your friends had a good week (all in all). Hopefully one never gets too old to appreciate the beauty of the far north and the Canadian outdoors....kudo's to you and your buds for ""doing the doing"" and going to this outpost camp. Too bad the week of fishing wasn't better, though no doubt it beat any fishing back home in Illinois (ha). Rich B"
5142418,Mike Borger,2016-10-06 06:19:00,1554,"Interesting report. I was at Miniss the same week and can attest to September pike being a tough nut to crack. We got some big ones but it was a grind.Too bad about the outboards not running well. The 15's that Howard has are usually an advantage on that lake.The better fishing at that camp is most definitely on the main body of the lake though. Lots of fish in the long narrow arm the camp is in, no doubt about it, but the main lake basins especially in mid Sept are key spots.I debated about whether I should post this or not. I fished the same camp with Howard a few summers ago and in fact still have a trip report up on my website. We accessed the lake the very same way you did and I took photos and wrote about it.Guess what? I caught flack from several different people for that. The MNR in Geraldton, other outfitters and Howard himself. (Howard wanted me to edit my story so I didn't show how he brought us in).It's illegal! Unless you are native you CANNOT access that lake using motorized vehicle. Howard is fine, he's native, but his guests could be charged. This was straight from an enforcement officer.I was naturally upset at Howard that he put me in that position (I didn't know) and refused to edit my story. I obviously wasn't charged, but as the MNR officer pointed out, he could have if he'd wanted to after seeing my story. Thank goodness he was a cool guy!He told me they put signs up on Howard's road every year and every year he takes them down. Was also told that sometimes they watch the road so it's very possible that a completely unknown and innocent guest could get in trouble which is very uncool!The ONLY way a non native can legally access Aba beyond flying in is boating down the river into the lake. Howard takes his guests in that way too when the water is high enough.Anyhow, I enjoyed fishing that lake and the camp was nice, but I thought this was worth mentioning."
5144042,Guest,2016-10-07 03:59:00,0,thanks mike and the other fellows for replying to my post;mike when we got off the atv and went in the boat I remember the fellow saying this is the river that leads into the lake and that we are actually on the other side of the lake across from our camp(could this be the legal way to come you described when the water is high) how is fishing at the main camp on lake o'sullivan we went to the other camp on the west end of lake o'sullivan the same time frame year last but struggled all week difficult fishing;would consider fishing out of main camp next year if you think its worth it;the price is right and cabins looked fine jim wolf Chicago boys
5144106,Mike Borger,2016-10-07 05:12:00,1554,"Short answer no. Fishing on O'Sullivan by all accounts is fantastic, I wouldn't hesitate to fish it. Personally I thought Howards camp was pretty gross and dumpy but I do know his prices are super cheap. That might sway some people I guess. Bear in mind his camp is also on the river leading into O'Sullivan so you have a bit of a boat ride to get down into the lake.This is the camp I would stay at if I was fishing O'Sullivanhttp://www.osullivansrainbow.com/"
5148961,Guest,2016-10-11 04:12:00,0,"mike we stayed at o'sullivan rainbow lake resort last September and had a very difficult time fishing (our first time there) the owner even took us out for a half day free of charge and still nothing special;3 fishermen for a week about 75 walleyes and few northerns do not want to go back ;I would like a few suggestions from you for next September price range $600-700/week we housekeep like to have our own schedule and using camp boats ;drive from Chicago all retired but in excellent health would not be adverse to another outpost situation (if fishing is great) our fishing pattern is 75% walleye jigging and 25% northern casting and trolling would like a chance a some nice notherns 35-40"" fish appreciate a few recommendations jim wolf Chicago boys we value your opinion and experience"
