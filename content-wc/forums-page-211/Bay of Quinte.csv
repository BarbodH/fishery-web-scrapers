5162282,iBigmacius,2016-10-21 05:30:00,334,"We have two types of licenses. Conservation license means u can keep 2 walleye and only one can be larger than 24.8""Sportsman license means u can keep 4 walleye with only one being over 24.8"""
5162297,Shellback,2016-10-21 06:38:00,8083,A days limit is also the possession limit. So 1 days catch is the most fish you can have in your possession at any time.
