Other than the lodges in the area, i think Bobby's is one of the most successful businesses in Vbay"
5147553,SinOrSwim,2016-10-10 09:14:00,1528,"Well, I bought a lure there earlier this year and did NOT catch a fish with it. I knew it was a matter of time before they went out of business selling garbage. We stop there each year. Best of luck to the new owners.....""ethnic"" or not. LOL"
5148537,NP4ME,2016-10-10 18:33:00,378,"Depends on who you would ask about my age and naivety. I just know that in my lifetime I can't think of a previous time where hoards of rioters and protesters called for the assassination of police officers (and then some having followed through with those calls for killing). I don't remember too many other times where people screamed to attack ""white people"" as they innocently drove down the wrong street. I can't recall too many times were an Islamic extremist walked into a gay bar and shot the $hit out of everybody because they were gay. So, maybe I just am young and dumb. As for painting a broad brush, I went back and re-read post #6. I'm not saying I agree, but as another poster pointed out, YOU would be the one to be naive to not see the truth in some of it. How many minorities have jumped on the Trump train? You have the other candidate calling Trump supporters ""deplorable, irredeemable, racist,"" and whatever derogatory terms she can come up with, all the while some of her supporters have acted out to points beyond imagine. Broad brush? I think that brush is stroking both ways."

If a business were to change hands (as opposed to going out of business) I wouldn't give 2 @@@#$. That it changed hands and you then felt you needed to let us know about an ethnic presence in the transaction is sophomoric. I must have missed the big thread about Figure-8 baits in Kenora going out of business. Or Bison Fire protection moving. The DVD rental place has expanded. Come to think of it the mall has been razed. And there is a new tackle shop (with bait, headlines here) that opened recently. The new owners could be Russian hackers going after the US election with terrorist ties. As long as they continue to provide a solid, honest service to their clients I could care less. -FT"

5150354,Obabikon,2016-10-12 07:15:00,2370,"It's a phrase that learned in college. It could be looked at as redundant. However, it does make sense if you look at the term ""prejudice"" as being ""unreasonable feelings, opinions, or attitudes, especially of a hostile nature, regarding an ethnic, racial, social, or religious group."" The term ""prejudice"" can be preconceived or not. Basically... you can know someone/something and be prejudice after knowing them. You are right that many times (maybe even most times)... the term prejudice refers to opinions drawn prior to meeting."

The question is not the nationality of the ""new owners"",Imo the question is the future direction of the business .Will they keep the well stocked tackle shop that turns a $ for 3-4 months or decide to replace it with something that returns 12 months of the year?

5145298,Guest,2016-10-08 07:17:00,0,If it is the same group that bought the gas stations in Prada tbat is dissapointing. Those places used to be very well run and clean. Now i don't want to touch anything as i use the restroom. The potential loss of a business selling musky tackle on that scale is the bigger issue though. There is literally not a single business in Canada that stocks as much musky tackle. It is deceiving how much he stocks because everything was taken out of packages and tightly packed on hangers. Personally i will really miss the place because there is no way it will keep going in the current format.
5145426,Obabikon,2016-10-08 09:16:00,2370,"wow... very sneaky. He changed his ""guest"" name, and posted more disparaging remarks about someone he has never met.... But he's ETHNIC... (gasp). Obviously he doesn't know how to run a successful business. All successful people start by not being ethnic. He and his partners only own several companies. I'm sure all those others are so horrible, that they just like to buy businesses... run them into the ground... and then waste thousands (if not millions) of dollars with their bad investments."

If anyone believes that there isn't some truth to that statement, I've got a bridge to sell you. Do you think everyone in NW Ontario is so pure they can't have a wee bit of discrimination in them? Some locals are very against new folks, be it in the states or Canada. I have seen it first hand in Canada with locals having strong opinions about US owners of Canadian property. You folks need to get your panties out of a bunch, and realize the fellow might have been making a statement with a lot of truth to it. Maybe some of you are as much haters as what you believe the OP is. I don't think it's right for folks to have predetermined opinions of new folks, but it's sometimes human nature."

Overt racism is on the decline in our societies in large part because civilized people have marginalized the pathetic scum who practice it. Continuing to marginalize them on a public forum like this one is right and good. Only societal pressure can wipe out the scourge of racism which has rung up incalculable costs to society over the centuries and continues to cost us today. Lately, it seems that racists have been emboldened to spew their poison. Those of us who recognize that they are stupid, pathetic failures who have no value to society need to be sure to remind them of it and drive them back to the sad little rocks where they have been hiding. And while the charge of racism is sometimes leveled too easily, in this case a follow up post made it crystal clear that race was at the center of this issue."

You mean because of all the activity going on up there like New schools, housing developments, new Malls? Oh, that's right........I heard there was a ""lunch trailer"" parked by the side of the road. Mr ""Banker""........When you have to build, one uses building materials. When you buy those up there (if you can) they cost more, much more. Long story short......generally you want to not spend more money. Plus Winnipeg population vs Vermillion Population? Go ahead and ""run those numbers""!! Its probably best there is no OSHA there, that way in the future there can be another ""fire"". At least they will be able to cash in on that like the pervious owner did."

I hope this one works out well and I hope that customers and prospective customers judge the store on the basis of how it is run and the services and wares that it sells. And on nothing else.Now if I were a betting man and wanted a Canadian business now might be just the time to get an American dollar bank loan and invest it in a venture which generated Canadian cash. A ten or fifteen percent increase in the value of the Loonie vs the $US might be in order and would make for a nice loan payment."
5142778,LOW1,2016-10-06 08:49:00,2828,I could never figure out the Canadian building material cost difference situation. It seems like basic materials are not that much different in price. But manufactured things like windows and hardware can be exorbinant. (It was about half the cost to buy Manitoba made JeldWen windows at Menards in Iowa than it was in Canada) In any event the exchange rate has greatly improved the cost of building supplies. And the Menards in Ifalls will deliver across the border as far as Red Lake.

I talked to one of the outside help and management inside, similar stories from each about the transfer of ownership. It sounds like one of the new owners is ""ethnic"", a transplanted former Pakistani surgeon that has a practice in Manitoba, not a suicide bomber, non-working ""ethnic"", or person of color living off the government, like we have so many of in both Canada and the US. From what I understand, Bobby's will be business as usual, with the gal from the tackle side taking over management of the whole store, no new faces from outside the community."

5140809,martinbns,2016-10-05 06:25:00,1520,"Well I don't know about the millions, if the math doesn't work that's an issue unrelated to ethnicity. I live in Winnipeg and every fishing store is full of Asian immigrants buying tackle etc. I have had conversations with Chinese, Philipino and Korean fisherman just this summer. Fishing and eating fish is a far bigger part of life in Asia than it is in North America. New immigrants to Canada often buy business's in small towns because it's easier to have your permits approved than in a big city. Most of the time, they are pretty good at running these stores etc. Often they invest lots of money that the older owners have stopped doing and they become a big part of the community. Canada is a different place than the US and in most cases these purchases work out just fine for all involved."
