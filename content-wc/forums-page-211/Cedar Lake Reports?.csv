5120762,Bill Krejca,2016-09-20 20:47:00,6107,"Thanks, Rich Bill"
5120770,prov1800,2016-09-20 21:14:00,5010,Will do.
5123562,prov1800,2016-09-22 18:25:00,5010,Got out on cedar today.didnt go far from clarkes.very tough bite still.worse than last week.lots of bass though.boat gas gauge blinking so i stayed close.but normally all good spots i fished.hopefully it will improve for you next week.
5135569,Rich B,2016-09-30 20:46:00,1081,"Bill....be sure to post a report upon your return....wishing I was up on the Cedar chain this week as well....nothing like fishing north of the border, anytime the water ain't frozen (ha - but that's just me). Rich"
5136138,Riverkeg,2016-10-01 13:17:00,134,"My party tried Cedar Lake and Clarks Resort for opening week this year and we had a great time. We are booked to return next year. Thanks to Prov1800 and others for some tips. I would like to know if anyone has good luck on the west side and where. We caught fish on that side but did not try any further north than the tubes. The fishing was much better on the east side and our best fishing was in Peephole lake. We prefer staying at Clarks, but that is a long boat ride when the lake gets rough."
5137761,prov1800,2016-10-02 20:54:00,5010,Definetly on the opener there is better fishing on the east end.time sqaure area and east bay are also very good and towards burned out bridge .nelson lake would be another good place.not really that far to the east end.and myself fishing lac seul and eagle a lot.cedar is not rough in my book ever.lol.west end has some good fishing to.cant expect to fish the lake everywhere on your first trip and really know how to fish the spots.sawmill and hatfeild hold lots of walleyes.all very close to camp.
5138449,Riverkeg,2016-10-03 11:54:00,134,"Thanks again prov1800. Agreed that it's not very rough by most standards but my ProV is only a 1660 and we fish 3 out of it lol. Not finding all the spots and learning to fish them is part of the fun of returning. We used to go to Clay, but the north arm is really the only place we ever found fish opening week and it got kind of boring just hitting the same spots everyday for a week. I have no idea where sawmill and hatfield are but I will ask for sure."
5138817,prov1800,2016-10-03 16:24:00,5010,"Sawmill is when you go left out of camp and hatfeikd bay is kinda straight out and to the right.its within site of the camp.was on cedar today.muskie fishing.got two around 36"".saw a couple more.crappie fishingvwas insane further east as it has been.walleye fishingvalso right now is very good. Have fished and guided on clay lake for many years.there is more than just the north arm the lake is 28 mi long and has fanrastic fishing for walleye,as well as one of the best pike lakes around and good numbers of huge bass."
5139561,Riverkeg,2016-10-04 09:00:00,134,"Agreed and I have been on most of the lake in July. My neighbor is a veteran of that lake and used to join us on it but both he and the folks at North Star told us to just stick to the north arm during the spring. The only time that changed was a couple of years ago the water was high enough to get into One Mile and we did really well in there. Yes, we've caught loads of pike and some really nice bass. I do like Cedar better since it offers the occasional musky for fun and some really nice crappie. We did get a few nice smallies but less pike and we were okay with that."
5139881,Bill Krejca,2016-10-04 13:00:00,6107,I'll post a trip report when I get a chance. Left thumb is healing from removing fish. Bill
5114914,Bill Krejca,2016-09-17 07:52:00,6107,"Will be heading to Cedar north of Verm. Bay. Any current reports, especially crappie, also walleye? Thanks. Bill"
5114946,Golden Eagle,2016-09-17 08:13:00,2642,I knew you wouldn't be easing up.
5116049,Bill Krejca,2016-09-18 06:02:00,6107,Still breathing=Still casting. Bill
5117377,Bill Krejca,2016-09-19 06:43:00,6107,"No reply's, guess we'll have the lake to ourselves. Bill"
5117417,Golden Eagle,2016-09-19 06:58:00,2642,I checked it out and it sounds good. You'll enjoy your stay. When will you be fishing the lake? There's a 50/50 chance I'll be in the area around October 5 or 6.
5119146,Bill Krejca,2016-09-20 06:54:00,6107,"Be there (Cedar Point) next week, going a week later than last year, going mainly for the crappies. Bill"
5120362,prov1800,2016-09-20 16:56:00,5010,Sorry bill.been having trouble with logging in.fishing on cedar has been pretty good.lots of eaters lately and a little harder finding larger fish.there basically in around 20 ft and shallower.some are deeper but i avoid fishing them that deep.crappies all over the place.lots mixed in with walleyes.i might fish there tomorrow unless i go for trout on cliff. Bring lots of clothing for next week.looking on the cool side.i you see a white ford and white lund there next week it will be me.

5120514,Rich B,2016-09-20 18:09:00,1081,"Have a great week Bill....please tell Ray and Kathi I said ""Hi""....they run a great camp, and the Cedar chain is fun to fish....any time of the year... Safe travels..... Rich B"
5120754,Bill Krejca,2016-09-20 20:46:00,6107,"20' red Lund Alaskan, 115 Yamaha, full crew on board, probably can't miss us on the lake. Stop by if in the vicinity. Bill"
