It used to be peasant season before the population crashed here in southeastern PA. Now I wait for the fall run of stripers and blues on the Jersey coast. Of coarse it's always prime time for planning next years fishing ventures. Here's the last walleye over the gunnel in our southern Ontario fishing trip.

I'm still not ready to call the season and plan to fish a few more days on local lakes in northern MN. It was 31 degrees this morning and yesterday only made it to 42 with a blustery wind. So the open water fishing days are getting down to just a couple more, but I'm not ready to pack in the boat."
