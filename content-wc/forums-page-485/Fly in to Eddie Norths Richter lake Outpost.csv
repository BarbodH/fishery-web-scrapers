1316780,fish1812,2011-06-10 09:23:00,2,"I Usually post on another board as I am not really a walleye fisherman, but after this trip i think ive been converted and a few people from that other board turned me onto this one so i figured id start out with a trip report, I just returned from my yearly fly-in, we usually target big pike and last years trip to Beteau was just legendary. So when the owner of that lodge, Eddie north suggested that we be the first ones to fly-in to his new camp on Richter lake we jumped at the chance, and man were we glad we did. This Lake has been unfished since 1991, and it showed, the second day after lunch we had a contest to see who could be first to 100 fish, it took me 3 hours and 20 minutes, now that was some fast action! heres a few videos from that dayhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNhR4jVT86ghttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7ekT...eature=related Thats pretty much how the fishing was for the entire week. We caught fish on jigs casting into the rocky shores, we caught them on crankbaits casting the flats and we caught them trolling the shorlines as well, heres another video of just how easy it is to troll and catch fish up therehttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3H7T...eature=relatedhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpT1s...eature=related The fish up there are simply not wary of people at all, in fact we often looked into the water and found them swimming around our boat, in the 6 days we were up there we caught between 2000 and 2300 walleye and lots of pike up to 40 inches. The fact that the sun comes out around 4am and stays out till midnight doesn't hurt either, and we took full advantage often putting in 12 hours on the water per day. The place is literally a walleye factory and somewhere I will definitely return to in the near future. heres a few pics from up there just to give you guys an idea what its like http://a1.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphot..._3858656_n.jpghttp://a1.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphot..._3407249_n.jpghttp://a2.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphot..._3527206_n.jpghttp://a6.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphot..._3643990_n.jpghttp://a5.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphot..._7761842_n.jpghttp://a7.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphot..._5200155_n.jpghttp://a5.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphot..._5587766_n.jpghttp://a7.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphot..._1074454_n.jpg"
