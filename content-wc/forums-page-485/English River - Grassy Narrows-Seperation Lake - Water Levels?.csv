He said that he's a real go-getter and he's done a lot of work on the road to the marina (Tommy's Road), which it desperately needed.....should make it much easier to get down there. We leave Tuesday....cannot wait, weather looks decent so far!!"
1317326,Bigstorm,2011-06-12 07:57:00,799,Talked to the lodge we are going thru and they alos said the marina is under new management. They also mentioned that prices for everything at the marina went up too. We leave on Saturday

1308153,kansasity,2011-05-17 14:47:00,80,"Let me know how you do up there, we are heading to Lount in a couple of months, lount flows into separation. Just curious to see how you do. I know they got alot of snow and ice this year so I would think water will be hi. Good luck"

1315240,Bigstorm,2011-06-06 19:27:00,799,"Heading up on 6/18, wondering if anyone has been up in that area yet. I havent heard much on the water levels other than they had a lot of snow over the winter and a lot of rain in the spring"
1315441,Guest,2011-06-07 09:15:00,0,I just got back from guiding 3 days on the English and the water level are a little high..which kept the walleye sitting in 2-4ft of water....but they were going gang busters when I did find them.
1316862,kansasity,2011-06-10 12:54:00,80,"I've been reading about threads on Lount and have read about cabin 14, where is cabin 14???????"
1316905,Bigstorm,2011-06-10 15:28:00,799,Anyone know if Rodney is still running the Marina? The number we had for him doesnt work anymore. Might have to come up with plan B forlive minnows and ice (no idea what plan B is yet though)
1317002,Guest,2011-06-10 22:07:00,0,I'm pretty sure it's someone else running it this year...I can get u the info tomorrow before I leave for Delaney Lake Lodge.
