1317644,wallydave,2011-06-13 07:03:00,2151,"Last week I was in the Ear Falls area of LS. Andrea at Goose Bay Camp said the level was normal for this time of year. It was lower than the last time I was there, but that year it was as high as I have every seen it! The fishing has been tough this year, we caught enough walleye for meals and take home, but not thr usual one after the other! Maybe the weather will settle down!"
