1317598,AROD12,2011-06-12 22:48:00,1,Just came back from there on Saturday. During mid week the water went up 2 to 3 feet. The Dam had all but 2 or 3 sections open throughout the week.
1317629,DanM57,2011-06-13 06:20:00,135,We just got back on Sat also. Water was high. Fishing was good as always. If Mike (camp owner) doesn't start investing some money back into the camp to replace junk motors he is going to start losing customers. Our group has been going to the camp for over 30 years and we are talking about going elsewhere. It is pretty sad.
1317648,jiggster,2011-06-13 07:09:00,183,I hope the motors are worked on before I arrive. How was the fishing and the water level?
1317655,DanM57,2011-06-13 07:31:00,135,I just sent you a PM
