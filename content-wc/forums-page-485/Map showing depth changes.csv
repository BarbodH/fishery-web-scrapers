1313615,55walleyes,2011-06-01 19:05:00,131,Going to Blackstone with Hidden Bay Lodge in July. Is there any where to get a map showing the depth changes in the lake?
1314564,55walleyes,2011-06-04 14:24:00,131,Are these type of maps not available at most fly-in lakes? I know the lake I used to fly-in to had one posted on wall of cabin. Any thoughts would be appreciated.

Although they haven't charted lakes for many, many years, many times they will have the old chart maps on file. Look for the closest MNR office at http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/ContactUs/2ColumnSubPage/STEL02_179002.htmland call them. Ask to speak to a Fisheries Biologist/Tech and they should get you pointed in the right direction.Not likely you'll find these maps on the open market.Good luck. Give me a call if you need help.ThanksChad"

1314606,campchick,2011-06-04 18:21:00,96,Walleye_Guru is correct. If anyone has such a map it would be the MNR (Ministry of Natural Resources) in the area you are visiting. I don't know the reason but they are not as cooperative in sharing these maps as you would think. Not all lakes have been surveyed this way - seems like only the larger ones. Good luck to you. If you don't have any luck get your outfitter working on it.
1314800,mb386,2011-06-05 17:33:00,14,"You will probably get a lake map from your outfitter. It will show elevations and some depths. The best thing about the map you will be getting ""is to show you the road to go home"". You really won't need a ""depth chart"". Easy lake to fish and there are plenty of fish"
1315217,55walleyes,2011-06-06 18:13:00,131,"Contacted the Kenora Office and they gave me a phone number of a place called ""Wilsons"" I believe. Called them and only map was of Blackstone Lake in southern Ontario not the Blackstone Lake in northwest ontario."
1315674,campchick,2011-06-07 18:39:00,96,"Contact the MNR in Sioux Lookout. Blackstone Lake is in their area, not Kenora's. If you don't get anywhere ask your outfitter to try for you. I found I had to beg to get depth maps of where 2 of my cabins are located. MNR would rather see them filed away than shared with an operator that can use them. Never mind that our tax dollars helped pay for the surveys."

1316865,55walleyes,2011-06-10 13:05:00,131,I have tried there already but thanks for info.
