1317769,IMWalleye,2011-06-13 11:54:00,35,"7 players (3 TX, 2 OH, 2 WA) met for our annual trip to Lac Seul Outposts. Fished for 9 days from May 29 thru June 7. Best trip ever for qty and size. We approximate 2,000 fish - majority walleye on jig and minnow. It was non stop, and every location paid off. Fished Scaler, Chamberlain Narrows, Pecker Point, Bear Narrows - didn't much matter where we went as long as we were near current. Biggest walleye was 28 1/4"", with several over 27. Probably 40 or so over the slot. Best NP was 41"", followed by a 40"". Best Smallie was 18 3/4"". Go figure - the big Pike was caught on jig/minnow and the big walleye was caught casting for NP with a jointed 6"" red/white plug. Camp and crew were top shelf as always. Usual mixed bag of weather, but nothing ridiculous."
1317825,Guest,2011-06-13 13:27:00,0,We have similar results every fall. The fishing gets better and better every year. Interesting That jig and a minnow was the best choice that time of year. I thought crawlers or leachs would be the hot bait in the spring. All we ever use in the fall is jig and minnow. Congrats on your great trip
