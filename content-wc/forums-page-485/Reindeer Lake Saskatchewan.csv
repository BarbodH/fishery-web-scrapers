1281626,cdotzenroth,2011-03-12 17:36:00,1,yeah been to Malcolm Island. There is an old plane crash of a dc-3 but it is prime northern pike fishing up there lots of terrain. Malcolm island is kind of towards the south but in the middle.

Also in the creek mouths. Lake trout will probably be up on the surface about that time as well. Len Thompson Five of Diamonds was always about as good as it got for pike, I think the #1 or #2 size. spoon about 3-4 inches long. Good 8-12 inch leaders are a must, 15 lb test should be lots. If you time it right, you will have fun. Weather in that country tends to go in about 6 day cycles, or it did. If you got there at the start of, lets call it poorer weather, it seemed to hang around for about 6 days, and visa versa with the good weather as well. Enjoy yourself"

1316954,orchard frank,2011-06-10 19:06:00,1900,"All of the above, plus Super Shad Rap, killer brought in slow, barely under the surface, and kind of a surprise for us was the #5 Mepps without the tail dressing, just a plain treble. Our guide swore by the plain ones, said the pike hit them harder, have to say we caught a bunch on them including some real whoppers. We also had fun with the sluggos and surface lures."
