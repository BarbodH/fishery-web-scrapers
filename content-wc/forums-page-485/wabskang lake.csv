But the four of us did manage to boat over 650 wlleyes for the week. we also caught several pearch over 10"" and 8 over 12"". the biggest walleye was 23 and we caught 10 that size and several around the 20-21"" range."

1316890,ftfarms,2011-06-10 14:54:00,444,We caught pearch at the keynotes and the hay feild. There had to be rocks there we didnt catch much in the weeds. We used 1/8oz crappies jigs with a worm or minnow under slip bobbers. With the wind blowing every day and every three hours out of a differant direction we found this to be the easiest way to fish.
