We do well on pike and walleye but I was wondering if anyone knows where you can find jumbo perch, we catch perch occasionally while fishing for walleye. What presentation do you use for perch? Some of the perch we have caught on the lake have had worm like specimens in the flesh though if memory serves me correctly last year we didn't much of them though it might be influenced by weather? If anyone has some spots they are willing to share it would be appreciated.Thanks,Kevin"
