Aside from what is in the truck and boat, how much more gas per person can you bring? I have heard both 5 gals and 10 gallons per person. Just want to keep it legal.ThanksSportfisher"

I've taken 50 gallons before and customs didn't blink an eye, sometimes they ask, sometimes they dont. Thinking back over the past thirty years I don't think I've ever had to pay a duty on gas, maybe I'm just lucky."
