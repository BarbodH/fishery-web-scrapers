510146,Guest,2000-10-31 21:29:00,0,Just wondering if the fishing has turned around on Lake Winnepeg. Last reports were not that good. Looking at one more trip before the ice. Any info would be greatly appreciated.Thanks in advanceHarty

Especially in the river where normally we should be catching in all sorts of places.The bay has been producing spotty results. In other words some are still catching but not nearly at all like the wild fishing we had during Sept. before and at the onset of commercial fishing in the bay.Its hard to say why things changed but the biggest suspect are the extensive array of nets on the bay. Pretty much all the flats had a curtain of nets across them leaving just the deep channel open. And its widely believed that the walleye move at night along these flats - they aren't using the deeper (open) channels. So you can draw your own conclusions about the situation.Good news though .... ALL the nets are off of the bay as of couple of days ago. They are required by law to be off by Nov. 1.DanJust let the big ones go, eh?"

Supposedly larger fish can't get into them, but I was absolutely SICK just thinking of that net, it was only one.I hate to take $ out of commercial fishing if that's how a guy makes a living, but...Todd"
