510106,Guest,2000-11-21 18:49:00,0,I also fished at one of John Slater camp. It was extremely disappointing. Next spring I talked to John at our Sports Show and he would not even talk. Just held his head down. There are much better places than Dogskin Lodge.

510107,Dave,2000-11-22 07:38:00,258,"I don't know when you went or any of the details, but I'm surprised that John didn't make it right - they have spent the last five years making their Lodge and outpost a great place to fish.I fish alot here in North Dakota (Missouri River, Lake Sakakawea) and Canada, and have to say that I have never experienced walleye fishing as fast as it was in September up in one of Dogskin's outpost lakes. Most of the fish were 19"" - 24"", and we literally caught and released hundreds of fish in our 3 days of fishing.John and David completely catered to us to make sure we were satisfied - if I were you, I'd contact him with a copy of your previous post and let him know how you feel.Just my $.02 worth.Dave"

We are a boat-in lodge so the remoteness and quality of fishing is like a fly-in without the expense or concern for weather associated with flying. Lots of great places and lodges in NW Ontario, sure you will have a great trip no matter where you go! southbaylodge.com Good luck, Roger"

510105,Dave,2000-11-21 12:15:00,258,"We did a late September fly-in trip to Dogskin Lake Lodge - the fishing and accomodations were out of this world! We've already booked next years' trip back the same time - John and David Slater are exceptional people, and their help is great! The meals served are nothing short of fantastic - I guess I can't imagine going anywhere else. They also have a number of outpost sites. Their website is:www.dogskin.comTheir toll free number is: 1-888-436-4754I can't wait to get back there!Dave NehringBismarck, ND"
