Or are they the actual new regs for Tobin in 2001?Personally , I like the upper end of the slot being higher.Also, I'd like to see the lower end of the slot being shorter, as well. (thereby lengthening the slot in both directions)I know it will make the Tournaments pretty ""strange"", but, I think it will help the fishery.I am looking for no bashing, but would be interested in other fishermen and women's opinions on this. Thanks!"

Speaking on behalf of professional anglers and women anglers (of which I am proud to be both) it is so disheartening to see the number of people who go to Tobin Lake (although it is not alone in this problem) and proudly hold up for pictures dead 12-18 pound beautiful fish.The new slot limits are not, to the best of my knowledge, yet a definite part of the 2001 regs. If I hear otherwise, I will be happy to post that info,"

The fish don't even get a chance to get into the protected slot with the current regs! This way, people could keep some eaters, and let the big ones go!Sleepy"
