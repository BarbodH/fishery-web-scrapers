Current has increased significantly with the opening of all the gates at Lockport and I'm sure the recent rainfalls have not helped. The water is the dirtiest I've ever seen it. Sat for approx. 3 hours and did not see one walleye boated around me. We eventually caught a 5 inch bullhead. The only excitement was the poor fellow who lost his prop as he prepared to speed off! Hope things ""settle"" down on the Red....literally."

The fish are there but trying to figure out where they are is another thing. Still haven't put the boat away in the hopes of another good shot of weather for a last kick at the can, but it looks like I'll be putting it to bed for the season sometime this week.Noticed that the current was up, but the water was smooth, not sure what it was like in the wind. Pretty sure there will be at least 2 more weeks of shore fishing before ice up."
