Next year some relatives would like to go along and a walleye trip. Unfortunately, there are only two choices, either the week of July 4th, or the 1st or 2nd week of August.I would appreciate any info from anyone on a good walleye lake, that you could drive to, pull a boat, with a resort that has housekeeping cabins. However an American plan would not be entirely out of the question.Also, for this time of year, what would you suggest for live bait, minnows, leeches, crawlers, or combinations there of?Does vertical jigging work at this time or is it mostly trolling?Yes, I do plan on hitting the sport shows this spring, but sometimes dates are filled, so if I can make connections ahead of time, I might get the preferred date.Thanks in advance for any advice."
