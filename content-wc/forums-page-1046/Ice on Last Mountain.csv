510176,Guest,2000-11-08 12:06:00,0,Good news for you ice fisherman. The south end of the lake is iced up pretty good. A week or so of the cold weather I'll be trying out my new portable ice shank!!!!Will
510177,Ron,2000-11-08 16:31:00,387,"Just where the heck is ""Last Mountain""? I live in Southern Ontario and it is no where's near enough to ice up here. In fact, I still go out to Rice Lake in my boat, I will be fishing the Bay of Quinte till mid December in the boat."
510178,Guest,2000-11-08 17:54:00,0,"Ron , In about 2 weeks you can ice fish or still run a boat in southern Manitoba on the same day.& P.S. Last Mountian is Located in Sask. 30 miles from Regina and has great walleye fishing. Ron you should get out more."
510179,Guest,2000-11-08 18:01:00,0,"Ron and we still run are boats till mid to late December. Some times we start are boats again in mid to late March , plus ice fish till the end of April. You should move to Manitoba."
510180,Guest,2000-11-09 08:26:00,0,Check out walleye insider from this summer. There is an excellent write-up on Last Mountain.William
510182,Frank from TBay,2000-11-12 16:20:00,312,"Got a little taste of winter today in NW Ontario. We are still a long way off to icefishing. We are still boat fishing and will be for a while yet. Can't wait to go icefishing. It is my favourite time of the year, it doesn't get any better in my eyes. A warm ice shack, good friends, big walleye and good food. Heaven on earth or close to it. Good fishing: Frank"
510181,Guest,2000-11-13 06:21:00,0,"Hey Don, ever try White Mouth in SE. Mb.? Summer or winter? Ive heard the put some new regs. on the lake?? Ted"
510183,Guest,2000-11-14 08:18:00,0,In front of Kannta Valley there is four inches of ice. The only problem is the fishing is real slow until spring here. I checked out Grand View and there is still open water. Another couple of weeks before the good spots are iced over!Will
