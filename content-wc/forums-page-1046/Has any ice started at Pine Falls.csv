Has anyone been around Pine Falls to see if any ice has started forming? I know from my office here I see a lot of ice pieces floating down the Red."

510239,Guest,2000-11-24 09:40:00,0,"Thanks for the update...I think will be heading out tomorrow (Sat) but I hear the forecasted winds are West 30km...this might be enough to keep me off the flats. Always envious of those who live in Pine Falls...I keep telling the wife that when I retire I'm going to look for a place in Powerview/Pine Falls...too bad there is not much ""river"" property available."
