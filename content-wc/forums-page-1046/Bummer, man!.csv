510219,Guest,2000-11-18 16:50:00,0,Same here Chris. Was hoping the weather would break for another trip or 2 but I bit the bullet today and wrapped the boat up for the season. Tomorrow I load the portable ice shack into my truck where it spends the winter. Santa will brig me a Jiffy 10 inch ice-auger so I'll be set to tackle those winter walleys.I hate the time between boat out and iceup..Seems unnatural to have a weekend with no fishing.Tight Lines!!
510220,Guest,2000-11-20 08:56:00,0,"Same feelings...grateful that I got out last Saturday. My boat has now gone to bed for the winter...my partner has his boat stored in a heated garage so if we were to get a dose of ""warm"" weather sometime soon it will be off to Pine Falls for one last one. Last year we got out in the first week of December in the boat.On the other hand I gave my ice shack a fresh coat of ""barn red"" paint so I am kind of anxious to pull it out to Pine Falls. Pine Falls is usually hot for ice walleyes from December till mid January if the ice thickens up enough....the earlier the better.I'am alway wary about getting on that fast water until there is at least 6 inches or more....any other body of water I'd feel comfortable with 4 inches. Last time I was out I did notice they were spilling out a lot of water at the dam. Keep the board posted with ice condition reports."
