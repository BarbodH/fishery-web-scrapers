Heading downstream, there appeared to be no ice in sight until we got near Treaty Point/Sand Cliffs where there was a fair bit of thick ice chunks which we had to circumnavigate on our way to the mouth....a lot of this pieces were clear so they were very hard to see until you were on top of them. It was best to stay away from the main channel as the ice appeared to be following the current down the middle.It appeared the ice was coming off the ""shallow"" shorelines in the areas just downstream from Treaty Point. There also was some ice buildup at the mouth which made me wary of venturing to the flats.Unfortunately for our efforts we were not rewarded to well at the mouth...only caught 2 small ones at the mouth...headed back to the cliffs and caught a 2lber. As a last resort headed to the bottom of Manitou Rapids where we caught a number of ""small"" greenbacks. Couple of other boats were there also and were catching very small greenbacks also."
