510163,Guest,2000-11-07 10:36:00,0,I am planning on making my own lead jigs this winter. Can someone tell me where the best\cheapest place to buy the molds and accessories is? Preferably in Canada but not exclusively.
510164,Guest,2000-11-07 10:53:00,0,I just priced some on 3/11 at the Fishing Hole in Wpg. and I believe they also have a store in Edmonton. They had about 5 different styles and all were priced at $48.99. I thought that was a little pricey. Check Cabelas although they don't have them in their latest catalog you will have to give them a call.
