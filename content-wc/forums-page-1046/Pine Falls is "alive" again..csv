510202,Guest,2000-11-14 09:41:00,0,"Headed out to Pine Falls on Saturday in hopes of one more ""boat ride"". Current was flowing real good and fishing was excellent.Fished the mouth starting at 8:30am and we limited out on 2lbers within a half hour. (3/4 oz. Red jigs and Live Chubs) Fishing was steady there till about 10am and then it slowed down. Headed out to the flats and trolled Firetiger Shad Raps and Deep Junior Thundersticks and we caught about 20 more....all were between 2-5lbs, no giants today.Boat launch was not slippery, but then again there was only 1 other boat trailer there when I arrived. By end of day there were 7 boat trailers at the mill launch.Something odd was the water was a ""coffee"" color...never seen it that shade of brown before.Hopefully the weather will heat up for one more try!"
