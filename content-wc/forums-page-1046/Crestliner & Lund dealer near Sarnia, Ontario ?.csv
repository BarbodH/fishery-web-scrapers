510188,Dave,2000-11-10 09:09:00,258,Anyone know wher dealers are for these boats near Sarnia?Also some comments on which is better Lund 18' Alaskanor Crestliner fishawk 1750?
510189,Brian,2000-11-10 18:27:00,140,The closest Lund dealer to you is Kopreva?? (spelling) located in Bothwell which is close to the 401 and east of Chatham. They are all right to deal with but I have heard they are questionable about boat rigging. If I was buying a Lund I would not hesistate to go there.Brian

510191,Dave,2000-11-11 08:26:00,258,Ranger anyone who would make a comment as ignorant as yours shouldn't question the class of someone else. Just to soothe your simple mind though I will let you know that I own a 21' Pursuit with a 200 H.P. Johnson Oceanrunner on it. This boat is fiberglass and I am selling it.

I THINK he was just joking
510193,Frank from TBay,2000-11-12 16:26:00,312,Get the Lund. They outnumber all other boats in NW Ontario where I am from. We have excellant dealers and the boats are number one. I own two of them. Nothing fancy but I love them. Good fishing: Frank
