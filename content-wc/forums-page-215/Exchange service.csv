2055882,SinOrSwim,2013-08-25 07:39:00,1528,"Ever since the exchange rate is so equal, we never exchange any money anymore. Have never run into anywhere that doesn't take American money. You get Canadian as change then we try to use that so we don't have any left when we come back. Which, never works but we don't stop to exhcange a couple loonies and toonies."

2060354,halfmoon007,2013-08-26 18:09:00,121,at the Canadian casino you get a good exchange but costs you the 400 to 500 hundred you lose on the slots when your just stopping to exchange money. But remember its no big deal your a walleye fisherman paying about 200$ a pound for fresh canadian walleye fillets for the wife and kids when you get home Yuk yuk. She still hasent figured that out yet...thank god........halfmoon

I quit playing the slots a long time ago so it might cost to much at th casino, but the ice site does not mention any fees for exchange.Will let everyone know if we use it and how it works out .Headin to nakina in three weeks.Fall trip hope the water levels are still up."
