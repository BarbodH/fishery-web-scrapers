Just wondering if anyone who has made this trip recently encountered any construction that would add any significant travel time to this trip. We're already driving 14 hours, any help is greatly appreciated!!"

5070233,drew59,2016-08-19 16:47:00,87,I was at Forrest Lodge on Caribou Lake in June. No significant construction on the Armstrong road. Just a couple stretches with very short waits. I think they were just doing some easy stuff so they might not be there now. I'm heading back up in a few weeks. Let us know if there are delays. Have a great trip!
5073417,Fishingfinn,2016-08-21 18:33:00,30,"I just drove from Grand Marais to Thunder Bay. No significant construction or delays, pretty much wide open. A few bridges are down to one lane with lights controlling the traffic, but other than that it's smooth sailing. Right in Thunder Bay its reduced to 1 lane for less than a mile, but no delays."
5076562,psi1229,2016-08-22 21:04:00,7,"I appreciate the info gentlemen!! We make this trip every other year, and two years ago we fell victim to a crazy detour in Minnesota on the way to the border, then had a 45 minute wait just past the border crossing on the way to Thunder Bay. This year I figured I'd do the smart thing and ask people who had already been there!!"

You can then click on whatever icon(s) come up and get a description of what is going on. I use it every June when we head to Ignace. Has helped bypass some issues or at least be prepared for them. Have a great trip."
