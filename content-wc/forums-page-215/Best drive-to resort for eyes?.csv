5084089,WalleyeWally28,2016-08-26 09:24:00,298,I also recommend Whitewing. My Wife and I have been staying there since 2003 and have never had a bad experience. The resort is well maintained and the owners and staff are great.
5085905,Crackback,2016-08-27 11:52:00,257,"The Navionics Map chip for Lac Seul I found to be really accurate for the White Wings Resort area I fished. I did have to adjust the water depth datum to compensate for the shallow water which was about -18 inches. After I did that, it matched up pretty darn good for the area I fished around White Wings."
5085913,Crackback,2016-08-27 11:57:00,257,"If you are mobility handicapped as I am and walk with a cane, White Wings will furnish you a golf cart to enable you to get from your cabin to the boat dock, even though we did bring my Amigo Travelmate scooter. Not many resorts and Lodges will supply you a golf cart that I know about! David actually re-soldered a broken wire on my Amigo's battery charger's plug too."
5086209,Stringbean,2016-08-27 15:07:00,279,You can go to the Navionics website and download a map.Try this link: http://webapp.navionics.com/?lang=en...orarH%7C%7CnsP. You can move around to any section of the lake that you choose.
5070641,DaBirdman,2016-08-19 19:47:00,164,"Looking for recommendations on a great drive-to resort for walleye fishing within 2-3 hours of I'Falls? Only requirements are for affordable accommodations, clean & modern housekeeping cabins along with great walleye fishing. Solidarity is a plus but not a deal breaker."
5070865,pale ryder,2016-08-19 22:18:00,1937,I highly recommend Clark's Norther Lights on Cedar lake and Clark's Camp on the Indian chain.They have reasonable rates on nice modern clean cabins.Either lake offers enough size so you should not get bored yet small enough that wind isn't a big issue.Both also offer really good fishing. But they are not super easy. You have to find them and figure out what they are biting on. I've had days where we put over 100 fish in the boat and could have caught many more. But I have also had tough days.
5071305,martinbns,2016-08-20 07:26:00,1520,"We just got back from Five Lakes Lodge on Gullrock, a bit past the 3 hours limit but great folks with a nice clean camp and great fishing. Ian the lodge owner is also a local Walleye Pro and if you are struggling, he will go out on the lake with you to show you some spots."
5071945,1700SS,2016-08-20 15:41:00,104,Red Wing Lodge in Morson.
5072105,Crackback,2016-08-20 20:01:00,257,White Wings Resort in Ear Falls on LAc Seul. You can catch your limit right off the dock using minnows and leeches!
5072441,fisherdee,2016-08-21 07:01:00,15,Paradise cove in Minaki. Lots of water of all types.
5072721,rather-be-fishin,2016-08-21 10:49:00,429,"I second Lac Seul! That lake is a walleye factory! We go to the NW end Ear Falls area. Several resorts to choose from. In addition to Whitewing, Check these out: Evergreen Golden Eagle Timberlane Gold Pines CherRob Goose Bay Gawley's Lac Seul Lodge Onaway Fisherman's Cove 11 months to go & the countdown is on to our 13th year fishing trip to Lac Seul! RBF"
5073489,DaBirdman,2016-08-21 18:55:00,164,"Thanks for the feedback! Some years ago we did a late September trip to Evergreen and same time frame the next year Minaki. Both were cold, real windy & rained 5-6 days. Didn't catch much of anything. But, those were guy trips & this would be family in early to mid July. I'll look into each suggestion. Thanks again!"
5076618,Crackback,2016-08-22 21:43:00,257,All GOOD PLACES TO stay and FISH ON LAC Seul..... no doubt about it.
5077881,DaBirdman,2016-08-23 13:38:00,164,"When we fished out of Evergreen, I remember that once past the bridge, there were reefs & humps that came up out of nowhere. Not shown on the map we had. Is there a chip for that lake?"
