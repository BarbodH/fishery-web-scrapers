5081569,Dakota Floyd,2016-08-25 06:49:00,62,We were up 10 days ago and fished the central part. We found them in 24' to 35' of water. Seemed to catch most of the fish on minnows and a jig. We averaged a fish every two minutes. Caught over 400 fish for 3 days of fishing. The only trouble we had were boats trying to bump us off our spot. We were anchor locked on a spot and people would troll close enough to us that I could have knocked their hat off with my pole. Made a few comments but they were in their 70's so we just put up with it. Vertical presentation was the way to go. Good luck
