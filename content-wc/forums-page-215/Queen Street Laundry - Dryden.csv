5077073,BornToFish,2016-08-23 07:33:00,1224,"Greetings, I just returned from another trip to NW Ontario. I purchased my bait for this trip at one of the popular sport shops near the border crossing at Int. Falls/Ft. Frances. I was somewhat disappointed with the place of business and the bait purchased. Another guest at the fishing lodge reported that he picked up his bait at Queen Street Laundry in Dryden and was very satisfied with the service and bait purchased. I have heard of this sport shop, but have never been to it. I would like to hear your comments if you have previous experience with Queen Street Laundry in Dryden. I might make the switch to this sport shop in future trips. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5077209,rnnonmt,2016-08-23 08:12:00,992,Only in Ontario can you combine a laundry and bait shop.

5077561,Golden Eagle,2016-08-23 11:07:00,2642,Is it across the street from The Grace L. Ferguson Airline (And Storm Door Co.)?
5077625,BornToFish,2016-08-23 11:29:00,1224,"Greetings, I don't know where Queen Street Laundry is located as I haven't been there. I believe it is somewhere near ""downtown"" Dryden - probably on Queen Street. I will investigate it further if there are enough positive referrals. Good fishing and tight lines!!"

5078745,farmnfish,2016-08-23 19:16:00,130,Bought a half flat there a couple weeks ago. Worms were excellent. Half a block maybe east of the beer store.
5080113,Northpoint,2016-08-24 13:21:00,38,"We try to buy some extra bait every year because I hate driving all the way up there to fish with crappie minnows or keep dead ones on the hook. I know others will disagree with both points. My grandmother used to swear by the dead ones that we ""battle scarred"" and I one caught a 28"" on a dead crappie minnow to the obvious joy of the guide. My mom even put red lipstick on the dead ones. Despite that all I like bigger live minnow and don't mind the extra price. I ordered some bigger minnows at the laundry is advance of a Aug trip and got pretty much what I ordered. I also used another bait shop in Dryden right along the road by the Dairy Queen (KA Sports 807-223-2171) I bought 50 dozen bigger minnows from them also and was happy with the quality and the price was much better. I have used this shop for several years and always call well in advance to place my order."
