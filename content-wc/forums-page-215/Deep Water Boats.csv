Think they setup shop right across from the Lund plant in Steinbach, MB and thought they could give Lund a run. Think they manufactured boats from the early to mid nineties till about 2000, then I think they closed the doors. I have one of these boats, a Deep Water Challenger 1730 DLX with the side console and a 60hp yamaha. Thinking of selling it, trying to find what Nada says its worth. I'm at the office, and the boat is tarped up at home. Think it said it was manufactued by Deep Water Boats Inc on the tag, but I can't find it at the Nada site....am I out to lunch?"

5024457,Guest,2016-07-27 20:46:00,0,"Ok, let's try that again,.. Deep Water and Misty River boats were both manufactured out of Steinbach in 1997/1998. The company I worked for, The Shamray Group (of companies) bought Deep Water and Misty River in 97 or 98...they also bought Century Craft, which was building Silverline and Invader/Raider at the time...that plant was in Winnipeg on Shephard/Inkster. I worked two buildings over and I was in the plant on several occasions. Anyway, The Shamray Group, run by an ******* named Michael Shamray, was a group of about 10 companies...some made money..some did not...oh, and he also embezzled money and hid it in other countries like Jamaica... anyway...October 11th, 1998, the whole thing came tumbling down...everyone was out of a job...they must have sold off Deep Water, Misty River, and Century Craft to ...Genmar? not sure..."

I have a 1997 Deep Water 1680 Classic (tiller) and I needed some misc. parts to do some modifications so I called the factory at Steinbach and talked to a nice man who said,""Just send me a list of what you need and I'll fix you up."" I did so and the letter came back-not deliverable. I called the factory and the phone had been disconnected. I think the company got started when a couple of design engineers jump Lund's fence and went out on their own. I chose my boat over a Lund Rebel because it has better design numbers and is made better. I chose it over the Explorer because it has more storage, can handle a 50 hp motor instead of a 45, and it was $1000 cheaper. I have the original brochure that displays your boat on the cover, but I can't find a way to attach a picture to this post. I haven't been able to find NADA prices anywhere, but your boat is as good as an equivilent Lund model--though some folks may disagree just because it is a ""no name"" boat. Good Luck. Razzer"
