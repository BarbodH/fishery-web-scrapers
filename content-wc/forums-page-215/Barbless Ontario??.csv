5067778,mms3rd,2016-08-18 10:56:00,148,"I'm inclined to go barbless...I just hate damaging fish that are hooked deep. As a half measure for now, I remove the middle treble on cranks with 3 trebles. Or clip off one hook on each treble. My concern is whether the hook weight affects the movement of a lure...I'm thinking especially of smaller husky jerks and top water dog walking. Any experience here?"
5078337,zeebee,2016-08-23 16:47:00,1144,Seems Im interpreting contradictory thoughts....Experienced and proficient fisherman have no excuse to not pinch the barb. Except laziness....yawn.Barbies sell....just ask Ken.

3232617,Bill Krejca,2014-10-09 17:18:00,6107,"As catch and release becomes/has become increasingly practiced, it seems prudent to refrain from negatively affecting released fish. Depending on the study, barbless seems like a logical approach - less/no time out of the water, less serious angler injuries, more fishing time. Almost any old standards die hard, folks may not take to it right away - not keeping the big ones is still in the process of evolving into this mindset. As stated by others, my experience also has been an unnoticeable difference in hooked/brought to the boat fish by using barbless. The next logical step is an industry wide reduction in the number of trebles on crankbaits, spinners, etc. Or replacing trebles with singles. My guess is this could not maybe be as popular with folks fishing for a living/fishing to eat. This is my opinion, please excuse me if I'm mistaken, please let's not start a feud referencing PETA, as did a past similar thread a year or so ago. Bill"

I am getting old and not as handy as I use to be, so in the name of safety I am now pinching down the barbs on my jigs. I have read on WC that it does not seem to reduce your catch rate."
3239217,67ZL1,2014-10-13 10:09:00,277,We use Bait Buttons on all our live bait rigs when fishing barbless. I know other guys just rip off a small piece of a twister tail.

3242305,port1042,2014-10-14 16:48:00,509,"I picked up a paper punch at Walmart for about $2.00. I used it on the plastic from a milk jug and used a utility knife to pre-punch a hole to poke the hook through after baiting. They work great for worms, minnows and leeches."
3242793,drlee,2014-10-14 19:27:00,409,"Just will chime in, though mainly repeat what has been said: I have gone barbless on all jigs, cranks, spinners, etc. for many years. Easy to get fish out of net, easy to get fish off the hook, hence, quicker release and I believe, less damage to the fish. Also, I firmly believe that the safety for the fisherman is a huge advantage in and of itself. I lose very few fish and of course, I don't know what causes the losses since I only fish barbless. Frankly, as I am sure is true for you as well, we catch so many walleyes that we really don't care much when we do lose one. No problem with keeping bait on the hook, though I think the idea of adding a piece of rubber/whatever would resolve that problem anyway. Really like what I have seen in this thread...it is indicative of the positive changes I have seen over the years in terms of fishermans' attitudes toward the fish. Slot sizes, keeping smaller fish to eat, attention to limits, careful release of fish, especially larger females, graphite mounts, etc. That is how we preserve a resource for our children and grandchildren. Give yourselves a pat on the back!"
3245497,billy weaver,2014-10-15 18:51:00,470,What a great idea. I have a hole punch and some plastic lids. What a simple practical way to stock up. Thank you!
3230217,Obabikon,2014-10-08 16:45:00,2370,"Personally... I don't believe it makes a huge difference one way or another. However, as someone who repeatedly takes hooks out of people... it'd be very nice for that purpose."
3230249,forgop,2014-10-08 16:52:00,880,I know that my finger would have greatly appreciated a barbless hook a couple of months ago. I came close to coming home with it. The reason it was cut was because I got tired of the weight of the lure pulling on it and feared getting stuck again with the other hooks while trying to pull it out. This was from a reef runner 700. http://tapatalk.imageshack.com/v2/14...789ddf77c7.jpg
3230313,Juls,2014-10-08 17:26:00,13414,"Our Canadian Fly In this past August was in Ontario, and we squished out barbs down just to make taking the hook out easier. It didn't hurt our catch rate at all, and I would do it again for any catch and release fishing I was doing.Edit: I should mention we fish for Pike when up there. We have all the walleye we need right here on Lake Erie..."
3230489,pan-man,2014-10-08 18:52:00,299,My only concern is for bait fisherman (which I am one). Wouldn't the bait come off much easier?
3230553,lassh,2014-10-08 19:03:00,553,I often pinch down my hooks in Ontario; however I do have issues with the crawlers/leeches/minnows coming off of harnesses when the barbs are down. I do leave barbs on for harnesses in ontario. The fish are usually lip hooked anyway when pulling spinners.
3230689,mrwalleye5,2014-10-08 19:35:00,1922,"I do not seem to,have a problem loosing crawlers off of pinched hooks. I find with live minnows I do have a problem. What I do in this case is have small pre-cut pieces of 3/16 wide rubber band and place this over the hook after hooking the minnow."
3231161,bigwillies,2014-10-09 06:54:00,515,would deffinitely make hook removal from nets a whole lot easier
3231497,AllenW,2014-10-09 09:10:00,11482,"Yes it does, I leave the barbs on all my live bait rigs. I do not bend the barbs on my walleye hardbaits either, the walleyes and such are almost always hooked in the mouth and rarely hooked deep enough to result in damaged/bleeding fish. Musky baits get the barbs bent down for personal protection. Unless your using baits that required long hook setting times or are small enough they get swallowed , I don't see a problem with barbed hooks. Al"
3231593,stjoeguy,2014-10-09 09:44:00,979,"The lake I fish in Ontario has a single, barbless hook rule. Barbless hooks are definitely easier to remove, whether it's from a northern still in the water at the side of the boat, net, clothing, or worse yet, skin. I would have thought that barbless hooks decrease fish mortality, but I'm surprised to read that most studies find the mortality difference between barbed and barbless hooks to be insignificant. It appears that barbless hooks have more benefits for the fisherman than for the fish. Here's a short article from 2011. ""A Literature Review on the Comparison of Hooking Mortality Rates between Barbed and Barbless Hooks"":http://nonprofits.accesscomm.ca/rwf/...strictions.pdf"
3231737,Mike Kansas,2014-10-09 10:14:00,1463,"stjoeguy, Thanks for the information and studies related to barbed/barbless hooks. Looks like that the most significant value to barbless is for the fisherman himself. Have had to remove some hooks from myself and fellow fisherman and it's not fun. Had a 8/0 circle hook in my ear this year and I thank Manitoba for the barbless rule. It came out easy and didn't affect our day or our trip or my ear. Thanks again for the information Mike Kansas"
3229281,Mike Kansas,2014-10-08 09:01:00,1463,"Would love to hear from the WC gang on if they think the Barbless Hook would be a good conservation move for Ontario. I have fished Manitoba which is barbless and it seems that it doesn't affect my boated fish rate but it does allow a lot more non bleeding fish to be returned which I think reduces the kill rate of caught fish. Just fishing for some opnions...not sure mine is correct. Thanks, Mike Kansas"
3229537,mrwalleye5,2014-10-08 10:33:00,1922,Manitoba has been barb-less... for a very long time. I went to Rainy Lake a couple of years ago thinking it would be a treat to fish barbed. After a few fish I ended up pinching the barbs. Just the ease to take out of the fish and net was the reason. I attribute very few lost fish to fishing barbless.
3229761,camp chef,2014-10-08 12:17:00,915,"We have been fishing with pinched down barbs in Ontario for 5 or 6 years. It is much easier on the fish , the hands and the net and hasn't affected our ability to get the fish to the boat."
3229785,BreezyPoint,2014-10-08 12:26:00,1581,"It's pretty hard to tell what the effects of barbless hooks would be. There are studies that show there is little difference and in some cases some increase in mortality. What I have read is rather poorly explained so I don't know how reliable the studies are. I could see some negative affect if the barbless hook was driven deeply into a sensitive area of the fish, but how often does that happen?In my case, I use barbless hooks fishing for northern and musky and find my handling time goes way down and I can release most of them in the water, which has to be a huge benefit to the fish. I also use single siwash hooks as much as possible and this really makes it easy. I see little change in the number of fish I actually bring to the boat, so I am a big fan of the arrangement.So my qualitative analysis is that barbless hooks benefit hard to handle fish, like muskies. But I have no idea of the real impact.With respect to walleyes and smallmouth, I find these fish, even bigger ones easy to handle and release, so my guess is that barbless hooks make little difference.Frank"
3229929,Fisherman Ted,2014-10-08 14:03:00,461,"At our lodge in NW Ontario we have been barbless for many years specifically targeting bass, walleye and pike. On a strong day where you catch maybe 60-100 fish boy does it make it so much easier, especially when dealing with multiple sets of treble hooks. The other HUGE benefit is when hooking yourself! That's worth the change right there. I have noticed the betterment of the fishery. No longer do you have to do minor surgery on a fish which can do a lot of damage even though they swim away and you think all is good. -FT"
3229953,port1042,2014-10-08 14:06:00,509,"I tried barbless fishing in Ontario a couple of years ago. While I suppose I've lost a few fish as a result, ease of hook removal more than makes up for those loses. In fact, I first tried it on treble hook crankbaits -- but now everything is barbless including my panfish hooks at home!"
3229961,BreezyPoint,2014-10-08 14:09:00,1581,"Fisherman Ted - I am curious as to the response you get from guests. Do they protest and do they actually go barbless?

3229969,Fisherman Ted,2014-10-08 14:22:00,461,Never had an issue. As we are 100% catch and release all of our fishermen are always looking out for the fishery. This is just a logical tool for such a practice.

I bent down the barbs on everything we used this year & found it to not create any problems & made the release so much easier on me & the fish. Never thought of the hook in the hand problem but it would certainly make that easier to get out also. Later, Jay"
3230001,BreezyPoint,2014-10-08 14:31:00,1581,"As a testament to hooks in the hand, two times I have gotten big musky hooks in me. Both times it required pushing the barb all the way through and cutting the barb off, so at least for me, this is a major potential benefit.Frank"
