5085337,Bstar,2016-08-27 05:41:00,564,If you go on their website http://freshmarketfoods.ca/ and look at their current flyer their prices don't seem to be too out of line considering where they are.
5085417,Skywagon,2016-08-27 06:28:00,1106,"Good thought Bill, but I have not heard of any food discounts for locals. Some food items are higher, but by the time you factor in the exchange rate, extra transportation costs and the fact that there is probably less quantity sold than stores do in the States, I don't think most food prices are all that out of line. The fact is, everything costs more here for many reasons, but with that said, I have not found a place I would rather live and I don't thank many have found a place that they would rather fish than N/W Ontario."
5086177,forgop,2016-08-27 14:29:00,880,"Nice.big place. The day i drove up, all power was out between Dryden to Sioux Lookout. Everything was closed. I planned to pick up milk, eggs, and a few other things that night before an early flight the next morning. Most everything closed for the night, but they literally opened the doors for maybe an hour once power was restored. This is where I'd go if going through Sioux Outlook.

5086329,jaym,2016-08-27 17:47:00,89,Ate at the Wellington when we were up there end of July. Looked like a new menu and the food was pretty good.
5086577,Fred_G,2016-08-27 20:30:00,908,Came through Sioux Lookout today. Looked like the road construction was complete. Ate at the Pelican Lake Sandwich Company located where the old Robins Donuts was. Second time there and food was excellent both times. And the Pelican Cookies are really good too!
5086601,forgop,2016-08-27 20:43:00,880,"That's nice as t was such a pain going through all the detour. The Pelican sandwich place is next door to Slate Falls Outposts base and their lodge for guests to stay. I don't know if Verne would allow someone to stay that is going elsewhere, but if anyone ever needed a place to stay for the night in the area, that'd be my first choice. 3 BR, full bath, and a living area/deck...much nicer than any motel and the price was pretty good too."
5083721,jimirjr,2016-08-26 07:09:00,1149,"Got to pick up a few perishable items in Sioux Lookout on way Up North... How is ""FRESH MARKET FOODS""....? What is a good restaurant for DINNER? A Good BAR ?"
5083745,tv4fish,2016-08-26 07:19:00,2694,"JIMI: We have found the Fresh Market Foods to be a very good grocery story (try some of their potato salad - good stuff). The Wellington is decent for Dinner (road construction SHOULD be done now?). Depends on what type ""bar"" you're interested in (fancy or workman type) ............"
5083769,Lovetofish,2016-08-26 07:26:00,458,Good grocery store. What we have done the past few years is to eat in Dryden then drive to Sioux Lookout and stay at the Best Western. Have a couple cold ones in the room and hit the hay.
5083801,pjshorthorn,2016-08-26 07:43:00,5654,I'm not sure if Dick and Nellies has reopened or not. They had a kitchen fire if I remember correctly. They had a decent bar food type menu and a fairly large bar with plenty of TVs tuned to sports. Lac Seul Outposts will do your shopping for you and have everything in your cabin when you arrive.......complimentary Send Brenda an email with a list of items. When do you guys leave again ? We should get on the phone and go over fishing spots for you fellas. PjShorthorn.
5083841,mwh624,2016-08-26 07:57:00,183,Dick and Nellis is still closed. Road construction was still ongoing as of two weeks ago. Sent from my SM-G900V using Tapatalk
5084033,bigwalleye1,2016-08-26 08:59:00,2632,"The market is very good, but don't be shocked at some of the prices. I don't know how the locals can afford to eat... Unsure on a restaurant, never ate in town other than Knobby's which burned down several years ago. Re: the road destruction, hey, no point in doing in one summer what you could otherwise do in two... At least a lot of guys can work close to good fishing... Seriously, I've never seen a Canadian road project completed in any way, shape or form of what I'd consider timely...Think about that little two lane bridge coming into Sioux Lookout. That, as I recall, was a two year project. I know the season is short, but geez...."
5084121,tv4fish,2016-08-26 09:35:00,2694,But ---- But -- They're in Canadian - remember the exchange rate (Sorry - just had to do that)
5084297,bigwalleye1,2016-08-26 10:56:00,2632,"Agreed, but the locals still have to suffer. They can't take advantage of exchange rate benefits, they're pretty well hosed....$9 for a can of Crisco even with the exchange rate is a pretty big hit."
5084505,btyreprich,2016-08-26 15:07:00,1067,"My experience has been that groceries get more expensive the closer you get to your destination. This is especially true when you cross the border. When it comes to our perishable, I buy these the day before we leave for our trip and place in one of those extreme coolers. With several ""blue ice"" packs in the cooler, everything arrives in good shape at the lodge. We bought another extremes cooler in early Speing at Costco. The cost of the cooler was covered by not having to buy expensive groceries on the way up to camp. Just my two cents."
5084665,Bill Krejca,2016-08-26 16:42:00,6107,"Re: Prices - They do seem to be higher as you leave the border vicinity. some of the reason could understandably be due to supplier delivery costs. That said, I have often wondered if perhaps the locals may sometimes get some kind of discount off the list price. Just crosses my mind, of course. Bill"
