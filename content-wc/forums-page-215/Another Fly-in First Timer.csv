5082817,mroyle,2016-08-25 16:25:00,74,"Would highly recommend Booi's....fished there twice and fished Cat Island twice. (You can see Cat Island from Booi's) Have been to Trout 3 times in August and this year in June. Much prefer August-bigger fish and better weather. Was disappointed this year in June as fish were several weeks ahead of normal and weren't in their usual shallow bays/fingers. Still caught a lot of Walleyes but fishing was a little tougher. Always take crawlers, especially in August. One problem with August....we had a tough time catching under 18's for dinner. Cat Island is a nice lodge as well but only provides American Plan. Never do that but this June went with guys that didn't wanna cook. Nice change though. Wouldn't ever drink un-boiled lake water. Giardia is no picnic!"
5034937,NAV165,2016-08-02 15:55:00,412,"I stayed at Booi's in early June of 2015. The walleyes were easy to catch in 4-6 feet of water jigging with gulp alive or just about any other plastic. The ""guided"" fishing trips with the daily shore lunch are great. Trout Lake is huge and it's nice to be able to follow someone for a couple of days to get oriented. The cabins are very nice as are the hosts. The camp is not remote because you share the island with others but it's really not a bother. If you want a meal served to you that's possible too which is really nice. The cabins, boats and docks are nice. If you come in around 4 or 5 Jim will clean your fish with his Bowie knife and feed the resident fish off the dock. Lake Trout fishing is very good too. Yes, the wardens do visit Trout Lake. It's not very far from Red Lake and I'n not positive if they fly or boat in. We had beer in our boat when checked and while we were advised it's illegal we were not issued a citation."
5035265,tammybrian2,2016-08-02 19:36:00,12,"as for drinking water, i bought one of these a few years ago for a canoe trip, and have been taking it on our fly-ins for the last 3 years or so. you can pump water right from the lake and drink it. no boiling needed. i've not had any problems with this, stomach or otherwise. like i mentioned, no need to boil, so no waiting for water to cool. pump and drink. there are two settings on this. one setting will pass the water through a ceramic filter and then the paper filter, the other setting bypasses the ceramic filter and goes right through the paper filter. because the water is so clear in canada, i always bypass the ceramic filter. these run anywhere from $85-95.https://www.katadyn.com/us/us/405-80...adyn-vario-usa"
5035409,phishfearme,2016-08-02 20:21:00,1242,"in general, live minnows are always better than crawlers - but the cost (almost $0.50 a piece) and difficulty in keeping them rule them out for us. crawlers (less than $0.10 each and you can split them in half) work essentially all season - they are like candy to a walleye - if you find walleye and put a crawler near them they will take it. some on this board swear by salted minnows - do a search and you can find recipes to make your own - I swear at them though - crawlers are better in my opinion. having beer in the boat (except taking it from one place to your cabin) is illegal in Ontario. the MNR does indeed flyin to check groups - it is rare however. we've been checked one time in 30 years or so of trips. it used to be that the MNR had to call the OPP concerning beer in the boat but now they can ticket for this also. just not worth it - keep the beer in the cabin and go back for a cold one. phish"
5036137,DaBirdman,2016-08-03 07:54:00,164,"Yeah, I've never cared to have a beer out in the boat personally. Heck, if I'm not almost forced to, I'll go the whole day without hardly eating or drinking a thing! Takes away from my fishing time. I agree though...fish hard all day long & enjoy a cold one back at the cabin. Been emailing a lot with Hidden Bay. Shaggy has responded so well to all my questions! He's fun to talk to. Also bookmarked MN Bait & Tackle. Looks like you can get loads of frozen bait from them. What's a good way to keep minnows frozen on the drive and the one night stay before flying out the next morning? Just keep them on ice in a cooler? If they accidentally thaw a bit, is that it? Are they no good anymore? Never used frozen bait/minnows before."
5036353,phishfearme,2016-08-03 09:11:00,1242,"frozen minnows is one thing and salted another. salted do not need to be frozen but some of the recipes call for freezing them. I've found that freezing them breaks down the skin, the bellies break open and yuck - repeated freeze/thaw will make things worse. so just salt them the day before you leave and keep them cool and there should be no problem - or buy prepared ones off the shelf in zip bags. like I said though, crawlers (and 3 inch yellow or white twisters on a 1/4oz jig) is all you really need. another WC guy, tooski from Cleveland, and some disabled vets were hosted by the Hidden Bay people. see:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...ght=hidden+bay phish"
5036481,DaBirdman,2016-08-03 09:59:00,164,"Yep! Saw that already! Two years to go and I can't get enough YouTube videos to cure my fix! Haha Wish we were already going next year, but next year we're doing our 40th anniversary trip to Rainy Lake (NW Bay). Would love to go THIS year still, but wife says we gotta do something ""big"" for our 15yr anniversary. Work gets in the way too."
5036505,DaBirdman,2016-08-03 10:06:00,164,"Oh!!! And can someone recommend a good, light weight rod tube for the trip? Most all of our rods are 6' & 6'-6"" rods. Either from Cabelas, or Gander Mt., Sheels, or Mills FF?"
5036834,phishfearme,2016-08-03 12:17:00,1242,unnecessary weight - just tie all the rods into one bundle - they will support each other - no one pieces - and will be placed on top of the gear in the plane. phish
5076114,DaBirdman,2016-08-22 17:26:00,164,"Curious....for those that have fished Miniss in the past....have you ever caught, or heard of lake trout being caught in that lake? I see it has a few deeper holes of 80ft and 100ft plus."
5077865,10lbeye,2016-08-23 13:27:00,61,"DaBirdman: We just returned from a remote fly in upon the recommendation of our outfitter I bought the katadyne base camp pro water filtration bag. It was a BEAST! It weighs ounces and filters a gallon of lake water to pure drinking water in less than 5 minutes. Filter lasts for over 1,000 gallons. best purchase I've made in years! Here is the link:https://www.katadyn.com/us/us/368-80...mp-pro-10l_usa I'm sold on it. No more having to carry loads of bottles of water or boil it."
5032777,DaBirdman,2016-08-01 16:27:00,164,"It's a long ways out yet, but in 2018 I'm organizing a group of family/relatives to go on a fly-in trip. Main reason is to take my dad who at that time will be 70. He did a couple trips some 35 years ago, but none since and it's been a bucket list of mine for many years. We almost lost him last year, so now it's just time to do it. Right now our #1 outfitter is Hidden Bay, but tied at #2 is Booi's and Knobby's. I've got lots of questions which I'm finding answers to as I read through the hundreds of threads here on WC (so helpful!) but a couple ?'s I got are as follows: 1. Drinking water - how many of you are using lake water? I imagine you boil it for a good long while & run it through a filter? We're considering using lake water for our coffee and kool aide. 2. When to go, when to go??? Thinking that mid June might be good for shallow water eyes & pike? But could be cold, or hot, or rainy, or windy, or even snowing? Mid to late August also interests me as weather might be more stable, but then the eyes & pike might be deep??? I can do either/or, but really love pitching jigs to shallow eyes! Can be fast & furious! 3. To bait or not to bait...that is the question! We could bring up a couple flats of crawlers, or spend money on live or frozen minnows. But then we'd be using up weight allowances. Do we really need live bait or are plastics sufficient? I could go on, and probably will at a later time, but that does it for now. Thanks!!!"
5032889,joeflip,2016-08-01 17:18:00,75,Better to have some sort of natural bait available than wish you had. The outfitter can recommend crawlers or shiners. I always have a mix. Good luck and have a safe trip. .
5033017,Carnhzkr,2016-08-01 18:12:00,964,"Ask your outfitter about drinking water. They may have it available at the camp. If not, you're okay to boil water and use it for coffee and kool-aid.Some will say you don't need live bait on a quality fly-in, but if it were me, I'd be taking a flat of crawlers for every 3 people. A flat of crawlers doesn't weigh all that much and can go a long way if you're jigging, since you can cut them in half or even thirds.Time of year is a personal preference and you pretty much summed up the positives and negatives of each. I like July/August, but it can get hot on a calm sunny day on the water, and there's nowhere to escape from the heat."
5033337,wallydave,2016-08-01 19:56:00,2151,"I flew with Hidden Bay last year and again this September, if you buy drinking water from them as part of the food plan, its doesn't count against your weight limit. We used frozen salted minnows, they worked great In September! Shaggy is good to work with, he might even be your pilot! Happy shopping!"
5033353,eyemike,2016-08-01 20:03:00,233,"I took my wife to Booi's in 2013. It was the 2nd week of July. It was a first class trip. Nice 18 ft. boats with 30 h.p. Honda motors. The cabin we stayed in had a loft lounge area, 2 bathrooms, full kitchen with microwave, Fridge, and chest freezer, very nice. If you want bottled water taken in ahead, or anything else, let them know in advance. Fishing was excellent! The walleyes run on the larger side. We averaged 60 walleyes a day. We caught some nice pike (one 44 inches) we didn't catch a lot. We didn't fish hard for them either. People in camp caught bunches of lake trout."
5033425,yoopertrout,2016-08-01 20:36:00,1172,"I did my first fly out two years ago and am going again in a week and a half. Outfitter said that he legally couldn't tell us to drink the running water pumped out of the lake. We did, without filter or boiling - no problem.Salted minnows worked as well as live for us. If your outfitter doesn't have them, Minnesota Bait and Tackle will send them to you salted, frozen and well packed for a reasonable price.We went with Kabeelo, and are going with them again. The fishing was great and the operation was top notch."
5033913,Chevelle38,2016-08-02 06:56:00,5,"Went to Booi's in early June 2016 with my Wife. Great experience...amazing fishery, clean and very nice, spacious cabins. You were able to drink the water out of the tap- they have some sort of filtration system on the island. Hosts were top-notch and the other guest were very friendly and willing to help you out - showing you around the lake. They had minnows for sale at the lodge but we caught most of our fish on plastics or leeches. You get spoiled going to a place like this. Going back next year."
5034081,phishfearme,2016-08-02 07:59:00,1242,"after doing dozens of flyin outpost trips, my thoughts are below: 1. Drinking water - how many of you are using lake water? I imagine you boil it for a good long while & run it through a filter? We're considering using lake water for our coffee and kool aide. if we have to use lake water, we ALWAYS boil it. gastro problems could totally ruin a trip. I have talked two outfitters into flying in water either before hand and/or in a check flight - reason? we tell him we will use lots of your propane to boil all our water - or maybe just fly some in for us - ice also. propane is quite expensive in the bush. 2. When to go, when to go??? Thinking that mid June might be good for shallow water eyes & pike? But could be cold, or hot, or rainy, or windy, or even snowing? Mid to late August also interests me as weather might be more stable, but then the eyes & pike might be deep??? I can do either/or, but really love pitching jigs to shallow eyes! Can be fast & furious! we used to go around memorial day or early June - cold weather is a good bet then and anyone with arthritis (like two of our group) wants warmer more stable weather. we've been going in early July for the last 15 years or so - much warmer and more stable weather - BUT, no matter when you go you could get cold weather. if you go to a good wilderness lake, the catching is there all summer long - the fishing though is nicer with better weather. 3. To bait or not to bait...that is the question! We could bring up a couple flats of crawlers, or spend money on live or frozen minnows. But then we'd be using up weight allowances. Do we really need live bait or are plastics sufficient? ALWAYS take in some nightcrawlers!! they are relatively easy to keep and cheap. we've had them turn a reasonably good trip into an excellent trip - more than once. Right now our #1 outfitter is Hidden Bay, but tied at #2 is Booi's and Knobby's. these are all good options - but throw into your mix kearns lake as they have cold clean well water at the cabin - see this report:https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...ghlight=kearns phish"
5034121,That Minnesota guy,2016-08-02 08:06:00,8293,"My advise is when you get a verbal commitment from people they are going ask them for a down payment. Make sure they understand it's non-refundable unless somebody dies. Nothing worse then working on a trip for a long while and having people back out at the last minute. You have budgeted food, bait, beds,cost per person, everything on a certain number of people. Other then that have a great time with dad!!!"
5034881,DaBirdman,2016-08-02 15:14:00,164,"Thanks for the replies. Are crawlers an effective bait to use earlier in the season when the water is cool/cold? Come opener here in southcentral MN the eye bite is more minnows and as the water warms into the mid 60's it's minnows & leeches and from 65 degrees on up its any live bait and cranks. Also, does the MNR or OPP fly in on these lakes to check you out as well? I never care to have a beer while fishing (unless in a perm ice fishing) but others in our group I'm sure would enjoy a cold one out in the boat if it's legal?"
