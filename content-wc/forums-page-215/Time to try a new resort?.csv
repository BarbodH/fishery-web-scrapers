5077545,BornToFish,2016-08-23 11:05:00,1224,"Greetings, I believe that owners/operators of fishing lodges are like all other humans. Many ""burn out"" after operating their lodge long enough. It's your time and money when you go on vacation. Thus, it might be time to find a new lodge if you believe that your time and money are not being well spent. It could be that the owners/operators are burning out. I second gullrockguy's recommendation of Stormer Lake Lodge. It does not have the muskies and lake trout that you mentioned. The walleye fishing is unbelievable. A guide would be helpful the first few days to help you find spots and learn techniques. After this, you may find the fishing to be straightforward enough to go it alone. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5069945,Northpoint,2016-08-19 14:09:00,38,My wife and I have been staying at the same resort for around 10 years and sometimes I wonder if there are better services available in other places that we should try. My preferences are: 1. The trip must be fully guided. 2. All meals are provided......including shore lunch. 3. Within five hours drive of International Falls Minnesota. 4. Great walleye fishing. Size is important but not a deal breaker. 5. A chance to catch perch and maybe a small muskie would be a bonus. 6. Cabins are clean but don't have to be brand new. 7. Boats should be comfortable and appropriate for the size of the lake. 8. Northern and lake trout fishing add nothing to the equation. Note--I did not list cost as a factor. This does not mean that we have money to burn---but I realize that many times you get what you pay for. Thanks in advance. Bob
5070105,Fishoil,2016-08-19 15:43:00,1277,"Since you didn't list cost as a factor I'll suggest http://shadyroost.com/ I've been there many times as a guest and the place is absolutely top notch. It meets all the criteria you listed and I don't think you'd be disappointed with anything there. The staff is fantastic, food is superb and plentiful, and the level of service is great. As a bonus it's only about one hour from International Falls."
5070345,rather-be-fishin,2016-08-19 17:05:00,429,"Check out silver water wheel lodge on Lac Seul lake. If you haven't already been to this lake, it's a walleye factory and you won't be disappointed.http://www.sww-lodge.com/RBF"
5073001,The tank,2016-08-21 13:20:00,340,I like lake of the woods I wouldn't go with shady roost after last week and there guide etiquette and boating clear to milesbay to fish?? So I would suggest Obabikon or witchbay or grassy narrows all look like great places to stay. I would also suggest separation lake lodge.
5073265,Lake Of The Woods,2016-08-21 16:53:00,124,"Lived and worked in the Kenora area for many years and judging by your description of what you are looking for consider looking into Totem,Yellowbird or Wiley Point Lodges.They are all owned by the same company.Totem and Yellow Bird Lodges are located in Sioux Narrows next to each other with access to LOTW and Wiley Point Lodge is on,well,...Wiley Point situated south of Kenora on the Western Peninsula,Lake of the Woods. The following website link covers all three Lodges or four if you include their French Portage Outpost camp. Totem Resorts - http://totemlodge.totemresorts.com"
5073281,That Minnesota guy,2016-08-21 17:22:00,8293,Do you leave fish to find fish?
5073321,Bill Krejca,2016-08-21 17:36:00,6107,Obabikon would be my recommendation://www.obabikon.com/fishing.html Bill
5077017,Hawker,2016-08-23 06:50:00,3967,"Young's Wilderness Camp (http://www.youngswildernesscamp.com/) fits your requirements to a ""T"" and more! Wife and I have been going there every year for the past 25 years and while we know there are lots of other great lodges/camps we've never seen or been to, we wouldn't dream of looking anywhere else!!"
5077097,gullrockguy,2016-08-23 07:41:00,44,stormer lake lodge checks off all your points. google them or check the add they put on walleye central.
5077513,Northpoint,2016-08-23 10:37:00,38,We have only stayed about six places in the past. SWW is one of the places and I would highly recommend it to anyone. I ask about new places as SWW is tough to get into because it is such high quality and as I get close to retirement I was to be able to go fishing more often each year. Thanks again for all the recommendations so far! Bob
