Can you imagine doing anything that is more Canadian than going on a fishing trip? Especially under these circumstances.As a foreign infidel I must confess that I do not find them to be all that good but they certainly are Canadian.

Their music will be played at the campfire, in the car and in the fishing boat for a long long time in this country... No one but Canadians would understand,, and this band was content with that! Long live THE HIP!!!L"

As an American growing up in Western New York, Gord and the boys were what we listened too and 28 years later I still have them on 75% of the time I'm listening to music. I have seen them 8 times all in the states from Las Vegas, Cleveland, Buffalo and Philadelphia. I have always considered the Hip my band even though I am a so called ""outsider"" in terms of not being a Canadian. I do understand the importance and meaning of Gord's lyrics and the cult following their fans have. At first I didn't know who Tom Thompson, Bill Barilko or Dave Milgaard was when Gord would sing about them in his musically filled history lessons of your country. Now I know who they are and the story behind them. I have a great love for the Hip and my fishing trips in Canada. But with that being said, putting those two things together makes the fishing trips all the more special."
