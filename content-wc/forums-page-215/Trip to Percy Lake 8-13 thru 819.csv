It was a great pick for a second trip as it is only 4 lakes down the the kapikawonga river from our first trip,( also the Little Currant river flows in and out) so to no surprise Percy was holding a lot of nice fat fighting walleyes. Jigging all plastics on 1/4 & 5/16 jigs we caught between 400 and 500 walleyes, almost all in the 16 to 20 inch range. But fat and fighting like a 26 incher. I have never seen such mass amounts of minnows in a lake as we seen there at Percy. Our biggest walleye boated was 24 but i recklessly lost a BIG maybe a 28 at at the side of the boat. (we are no net fisherman to cut fly in bulk). And for a couple of guys jig fishing 100% of the time with 8 lb mono did we land some big pike. A couple of 38 and 36 inchers and more just a tic smaller. Cant help to think if we rigged up and went after them big ole boys in Percy the thrill we we would have gotten. Mark Cassidy has a Beautiful lodge there and for the fist time ever had a recliner to take my afternoon nap. It was a nice second trip and we had a blast. .........2017 season come on, LOL .....

I did some searching and found the Nakina north web site - it shows $650US for a seven day flyin - is that correct?? is something not included?? this would be the biggest bargain around for a housekeeping single cabin lake flyin. will have to look into this for a future trip. thanks, phish"
