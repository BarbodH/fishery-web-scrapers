5059410,Pooch,2016-08-14 19:12:00,4619,Watch where in the fridge you park your worms. Some places in the fridge are much colder than the rest. Seems the middle of the top shelf is many times the coldest.Pooch
5060161,tv4fish,2016-08-15 07:31:00,2694,"Like a few of the other guys, we have never had any major issues keeping our crawlers nice and healthy for a full week of fishing. I buy our flat of crawlers here in Minnesota and they are delivered to me in an insulated box in a bag with a little dirt about 2 days before we leave for Canada. I immediately mix up a batch of Buss Bedding (per the directions). I then try to separate the crawlers from the dirt as best as I can and place the crawlers and the Buss Bedding in a styrofoam cooler that I have used for many years. It is a ""split"" rectangular box that I use ""Duck tape"" as the ""hinge"". It is about 15""x18""x6"" and fits in our camp refrigerator just fine. I keep that box in our refrigerator until we leave for Canada. When we go fishing each day, we take a good supply of crawlers and bedding out of this cooler and put in a small ""beer"" cooler with a handle and flip up lid. We put a layer of folded up moist (not soggy wet) newspaper on top of the crawlers and throw in a small refreezable ice pack on top of that. It's pretty convenient to just flip the lid up and grab a crawler and flip the lid right back down so the crawlers stay cool while we are out fishing. When we get back after a day of fishing, we just transfer any unused crawlers back into the box that has been in the refrigerator, watching for any dead crawlers (very seldom do we have any) and then repeat the process the next day."
5065081,Baseline,2016-08-17 06:07:00,3207,We bought a big cooler for our crawlers. They are placed in the bottom and we use frozen water bottles for cooling so there is no water mess form melting ice. These bottles will cool for 5 days if you have a decent cooler and keep it out of the sun. Our crawlers stay fresh and lively. One thought I had is that the crawlers bought in August may have been stored for a long time and could be starving if the dealer hasn't been tending to them. The crawlers could be reacting to the change of conditions.......and maybe fear.
5081937,Full Moon,2016-08-25 08:38:00,9,"First, thanks for your wisdom and experience. It is obvious keeping healthy worms requires dedicated work. We leave next week, and my buddy is in charge of the worms. He likes worms and will start giving them daily pep talk. The number one item that was most frequently mentioned in keeping worms healthy was temperature. I suspect that is where we have been at fault as we arrive in camp, load the refrigerator to the max, including the flat of worms in paper bedding. Crank down the refrigerator setting, and come Tuesday the refrigerator has good cold beer and the worms have brain freeze. There is a split opinion about bringing worm in from the lake and mixing with the mother ship. Some of you do, some don't. That's points at another one of our problems, as we have not inspected for worms that are in trouble and discard on a daily basis. Feedback summary: 1. Upon purchase immediately check for any dead or sickly looking crawlers. Dead crawlers in bedding is bad. 2. Prior to leaving for Canada, immediately mix up a batch of Buss Bedding (per the directions). I then try to separate the crawlers from the dirt as best as I can and place the crawlers and the Buss Bedding in a styrofoam cooler that I have used for many years. 3. What you take out fishing, do not return to the main flat of crawlers. Bring & use a smaller crawler box for the boat. 4. Make sure there are holes/oxygen vents in the Styrofoam flat. 5. Bring extra/spare bedding & replace mid week. 6. Inspect crawlers in the flat every couple of days for dead ones. 7. Go around some of the trees and grab handfuls of the moss you find and put in with them. Worms on steroids!"
5082321,tv4fish,2016-08-25 10:51:00,2694,"WELLLLL - One HAS to have priorities............Quote: Bring & use a smaller crawler box for the boat. Also make sure to put something in that cooler to keep them cool - ice pack, etc.AND Best of luck on ""another"" trip."
5056417,Full Moon,2016-08-12 15:49:00,9,"I am perplexed in keeping nightcrawlers healthy, and am looking for assistance. Have been purchasing them in Minneapolis, in paper bedding, and placing in the refrigerator upon arrival at our camp in Sioux Lookout. Same day. By the end of the week they are sickly and foul. The Minneapolis supplier packages them for transit in a styrofoam container with blue ice. Before someone high jacks the thread, and says purchase in Ontario. I have done that and have been more disappointed. Any tips for keeping them healthy during our trip would be greatly appreciated!"
5056473,@Lunker,2016-08-12 16:25:00,835,Maybe immediately upon purchase transfer them to fresh bedding? You don't say how far it is between your house and where you buy the crawlers. But mix up the bedding and get it chilled before you leave home and then transfer before you leave the bait shop. Assuming they're kept at a fairly constant cool temp on your trip and in the fridge at camp.
5056489,DaBirdman,2016-08-12 16:29:00,164,"I can't offer up too much except for a tip or two which you may already know... 1. Upon purchase immediately check for any dead or sickly looking crawlers. Dead crawlers in bedding are bad. 2. What you take out fishing, I wouldn't return to the main flat of crawlers. Bring & use a smaller crawler box for the boat. 3. Make sure there are holes/oxygen vents in the styrofoam flat. 4. Bring extra/spare bedding & replace mid week. 5. Inspect crawlers in the flat every couple of days for dead ones. Other than that, there isn't much else I can offer up. Good luck!"
5056633,Carnhzkr,2016-08-12 18:49:00,964,"Could the refrigerator you're putting them in be too cold? I've never had a problem keeping crawlers and I've used both bedding from the US and crawlers in dirt purchased in Canada with equal success. The only time I had an issue was the one time I thought it'd be a good idea to keep the cooler of crawlers in the refrigerator and they froze. Since then, I always transfer them into a styrofoam cooler and keep fresh ice on them, changing the ice twice per day. I understand the concern, but I always put my unused crawlers back into the main cooler after the end of the day. Never been an issue for me. In fact, this spring I bought a flat in Canada in dirt and brought the unused crawlers back to the US and kept them in the same dirt in my beer fridge. The only thing I did was add some coffee grounds and corn meal in the dirt. I transferred those into bedding for my next trip about 5 weeks later and they stayed healthy and fat until we used the last one."
5056649,Muskiemaniac,2016-08-12 18:55:00,4,"We are headed up to Sioux Lookout next Friday. We pick our worms up in Superior, Wisconsin. Usually get a flat of worms and they will keep for months. We of course use the artificial bedding and dump everything in a styrofoam cooler. We keep our cooler outside in the shade while we are at camp. We freeze .5 gallon milk jugs and every morning put a fresh frozen jug in the cooler with newspaper under it. We also replace the newspaper every couple days so the bedding does not become soggy. We take the worms out on the lake in a smaller bait box and also keep that in a cooler while on the water. When we are done for the day we dump worms back into big cooler. Have never seem to have a problem. Have been doing this for over 20 years. Another good tip is to make sure that there is a latch on your cooler or bring some duct tape with you. Worms are great escape artists and it's no fun being a worm wrangler in the bed of your truck when you get to camp when you just want to get on the water."
5056938,octanehi5,2016-08-13 05:42:00,1104,"One of the problems is crossing into Canada you have to have your worms in bedding, We have substituted peat moss once we get to the lake,Keep them moist as well as cold,in the boat as well as storage.Worm glo is a great food for them it turns them chartruse color,leaves a sent trail in the water works great"
5057042,lassh,2016-08-13 07:34:00,553,I'm with Carnhzkr- the fridge is probable freezing some of them and they die and contaminate the others.
5057202,hoppy63,2016-08-13 11:00:00,367,"When you get to camp go around some of the trees and grab some handfuls of the moss you find and put in with them. Im going only on my fourth trip, so not all that experienced but my partner has been on 30+ trips and swears by it. And I have seen it. Like worms on steroids!"
5057794,Pooch,2016-08-13 19:25:00,4619,"Worms keep well in a fifty degree (F) refrigerator. Beer does not.....When traveling and in camp we keep our crawlers in an insulated cooler stored inside of a larger cooler with big chunks of ice. They seem to do real well as the cooler they are in tempers any changes in temperature while the larger cooler with ice is good for soda or beer. I keep a small thermometer in the worms and it stays around fifty all the time, while the beer and soda stay cold.Pooch"
5058122,forgop,2016-08-14 01:23:00,880,"I've picked up a flat of crawlers on every single trip and in 4 different fridges, they've all done fine until the last day. The only crawlers in bad shape at all are the ones that have sat in the boat all day long. I just take out a day's worth of crwalers out of the flat, put them in a can, and back in the fridge the flat goes. Repeat every morning. The last day, I take the whole box and then dump the rest on my favorite walleye grounds."
