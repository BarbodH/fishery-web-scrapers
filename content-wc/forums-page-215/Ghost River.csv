5069833,mroyle,2016-08-19 12:53:00,74,"Just returned from Ghost River Camp with son and seven year old Grandson....his first Canadian adventure. The camp, boats, and hosts (Darrell and Tena) were fantastic as well as the cabins and lodge. We definitely found a fishing partner as he was intent on fishing, fishing, and more fishing. At one point during a mid-afternoon lull I asked if he wanted to use the I-Phone for a game. His reply: ""No I just wanna fish!"" He caught the biggest walleye at 23.5 for the week. Only 2 walleyes over 18 inches. Very disappointed in the size and numbers (40-50 day for the boat). He was very excited with those numbers though and quite a few pike so the trip was a huge success. Also were fortunate to see a moose, bear, and a wolf. My first wolf as well after 50 years of Canadian trips. One of my most enjoyable trips with the 3 generations fishing together. When we left his first question: Where are we going next year? P.S. I even enjoyed the shore lunches as w gave those up several years ago in favor of our ""shore lunches"" in the cabin while enjoying a cold one. Mike"
