5079257,pattmit,2016-08-24 06:17:00,36,Is there any place in late September a guy could buy leeches? Prefer it to be in a town in hwy 105 because that's our route to red lake. Thanks in advance.

Many places of business were out of leeches when I arrived in Canada almost three weeks ago. I did find some leeches at the Great Bear on Hwy 11 east of Fort Frances. A buddy found some at Queen Street Laundry in Dryden. You might also want to check Clark's on Cedar Lake. I wouldn't worry too much if I couldn't find leeches at this time of the year. Walleyes in the lakes that I fish often switch to a minnow bite around the middle of August. Crawlers might be your best backup. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
