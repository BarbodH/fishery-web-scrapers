My old man and I are taking our first ever fishing trip/vacation together and we're going to Rays Camp on Ramsey Lake in Ontario. He was referred to the camp through a coworker.Thing is he's not much of a fisherman, more of a deer hunter. I'm the fisherman of the family, but I'm not much of a walleye fisherman. I'm very comfortable with jigs and throwing cranks, but have never seriously trolled or drifted for eyes.Can anyone provide some general tips so we can get some fish in the boat? Better yet, anyone been to Ray's Camp? Are there lake maps or anything I could find online?Thanks in advance folks!Sent from my SM-G900V using Tapatalk"

If you're heading up in the next few weeks, you might want to consider doing some bottom-bouncing during the week. Be sure to post a report on Ray's Camp and Ramsey Lake when you and your Dad get back....hopefully this trip is just the first of many Father-Son fishing trips for you both. Rich B"

I would try jigging usual spots....narrows where you have current, around any points and islands. Anywhere water is flowing in/ out should produce. Just don't ""hide"" from the wind. You will do best where wind is pushing against shore, island, points,as it will be pushing the food there, thus the batfish will be there feeding.....and that will attract your food......walleyes! If you are having trouble locating them you can always troll some plastic and when you find fish, anchor off or drift over them jigging. I like the original floating rapala in black/ gold. Good luck.......look forward to report on your return!"

This year different like all years, they have had constant changing weather, temps up and down plus stormy weather. If weather settles down I THINK THE FISHING WILL PICKUP. Enjoy, very picture perfect lake. BTW we camp on island north of Rays camp. Paul"
5025897,phishfearme,2016-07-28 12:22:00,1242,"welcome to the Canada eh? board - the best place for info on Canadian fishing - ESPECIALLY for north west Ontario - and there's a reason for that. when I started heading north for fishing back in the early 70's, we stumbled onto Rays camps (Ray still ran it and was transferring it to Bill Kearn and Hersh Hite) and we fell in love with the place. being new to Canada our expectations were to catch fish and we caught lots of pike - and only pike as walleye are not native to the Spanish river system (the ones there now were stocked by the MNR). we repeated trips to ray's for 15 years or so and watched the pike fishing crash, the walleye flourish and then the walleye crash - then finally left for greener pastures when we saw water skiers in Cat Bay. (we also watched the water level fluctuate incredibly - from flooding the docks to emptying the bay at the lodge - remember, this is a reservoir not a lake - regulated by Hydro). our last trip there was over 25 years ago. it all gets down to what are your expectation for privacy, quality and quantity - and consistency. when I hear people blame bad fishing on the weather I really worry about the lake first - and that's a key issue, with water levels radically changing, year classes of walleye run from non-existent to great. for privacy, there are lots of roads into the reservoir - both legal and illegal - especially up in the cat bay area. like I said, we moved to northwest Ontario when we encountered water skiers in cat bay. in the NW, you can get a large private lake all to yourselves and the wilderness characteristics of the lake do not seem to be impacted by weather. in bad weather, the ""fishing"" may be uncomfortable but the ""catching"" is sooo much better than in eastern Ontario. look at a map of northern Ontario - note where all the blue is and note where all the roads are not. none the less, it is a bargain price wise, the facilities are excellent and you may do well - others have - but ""doing well"" is in the eye of the beholder - for us, even when the walleye were peaking at Ramsey, the catching just didn't hold a candle to a NW Ontario wilderness lake. go and let us know how you did. I have lots of maps if you want them. phish"

I will do my absolute best to provide an accurate report and experience of our time up there, including a lot of pictures. I've pretty much filled my tackle bag with jigs and plastics. Tons of fish or not, I'm going to enjoy myselfSent from my SM-G900V using Tapatalk"
