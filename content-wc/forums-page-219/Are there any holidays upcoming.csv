I was wondering if there are any Canadian holidays that are being observed this coming weekend. We crossed around the same time last year, and for some reason the grocery stores were all closed in Dryden. Apparently there was some holiday that we were not aware of. We weren't sure if it was a Canadian holiday, or something specific to Ontario."

5023321,kcguy68,2016-07-27 12:14:00,51,"So....I am guessing many stores take the opportunity to take that entire weekend off to take full advantage of this civic holiday. I like that concept. If that's the case, I guess we can count on Wal-Mart to be open. I don't think they know the meaning of the word holiday."
