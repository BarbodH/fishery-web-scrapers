4904609,mms3rd,2016-06-06 11:37:00,148,"A fly in trip is not possible this year. My wife and I are looking for a remote drive in or boat in location or maybe a small camp. We bring up two kayaks...mine for show and hers for go. Prefer to fish for walleye and small mouth...or anything else that bites. We've been lucky to find a couple remote places in the past but I want to try something new. By remote, I mean few cabins in the area...limited boat activity so wife doesn't get swamped with a 50 horse...it would be OK if she had life insurance. Not white water...what we call in Kansas, flat water. This is for post-August. My hobby is reading maps for NW Ontario and surfing every website I can find for lodges, resorts, camp, etc., but thought you might have ideas on what I have missed. Suggestions. Thanks....Mike"
4904649,Thompmd,2016-06-06 11:45:00,320,This is our first trip there but we chose Crow Rock on LOTW. They are a boat in camp and we chose their private island cabin. They have some boat cache lakes that might be really interesting in a kayak. PM if you have more questions. Good Luck

4906401,adempsey,2016-06-06 19:10:00,963,"Sorry, I thought a couple were closer to Sault Ste. Marie than they are. I figured, near Sault Ste. Marie might still be a viable option."
4907585,Steve Ediger,2016-06-07 08:08:00,97,"Mike, I would like to suggest Lac Seul Lodge as a possible destination for you. I know Lac Seul is known as big water lake, but Lac Seul Lodge is located in Rat Bay which is protected from high winds most of the time. Rat Bay is also connected to two other bays and two small lakes that would keep you from going out on the big water. The walleye, pike, and smallmouth fishing in these bays and lakes is very good. The cabins are very nice as are the people that own and work there. I see you are from Kansas. FYI, Lac Seul Lodge is owned and operated by another Kansas couple. Give them a call, I am sure you would enjoy a trip there. Steve"
4957649,LacSeulSam,2016-06-29 22:34:00,9,"Hi Mike, my wife and I have just opened a place on Lost Lake, part of Lac Seul. We are located on the Lac Seul First Nation. Our place is located on the lake and there are a number of places close by that you can launch your kayaks from to really explore and enjoy the area. Sam"
5026473,Lake Of The Woods,2016-07-28 17:04:00,124,"Mike,I posted some information for someone in another thread yesterday who was also inquiring in a similar destination description.Click on the following link and you can read the two replies I sent.https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...e+Woods&page=2 As stated in the first reply I lived in the Kenora for many years and very am familiar with the areas many top fishing and hunting spots. If you want more information than is supplied in the other thread then feel free to PM me and I can give you my phone number if you want to chat about the area or suggested camp that my friends Don & Joan Sauve have owned and operated for 30+ years."
5027505,mms3rd,2016-07-29 09:15:00,148,"Thanks for the info. I have looked at this area quite often. Maybe I could get benefit from all of my Fishing with Gussy Youtubes I've watched. I do need some sheltered areas for my wife to kayak...heavy water gets scary....I bring a kayak but it collects bird poop.A fall trip is starting to look unlikely, so what time in the spring do you recommend? I often have gone the first week in June in Minnesota because the schools aren't out yet....less pressure. Maybe better to wait til summer? Maybe every season is different before end of May and beginning of June. Thanks, Mike (I plan to write a review of all of the camp websites)"
