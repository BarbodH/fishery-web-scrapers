5025753,SinOrSwim,2016-07-28 11:24:00,1528,"I'm not a lodge owner but am a business owner. I agree with the position he needs to let the owner know. Even after the fact by email. Some people aren't comfortable with the face to face stuff in a negative situation. Nothing wrong with an email letting him know he was hoping for a bit of a discount or something to help remedy the situation that happened. If the lodge owner does nothing, fine. But, something should be said. For example if you are at a restaurant and soemthing is wrong with your food. The waitress knows and tries to fix it. But, at the end she asks how it all went. You say nothing. they are going to charge you full price. But, if you say something, maybe they give you a free meal. Point being, they need to know you aren't happy and what specifically you weren't happy with. Then, the owner can choose how they want to handle it. Like Ted said, if he thinks you are satisfied, why should he offer a discount if he doesn't think you were unhappy? Can lose a lot of money that way. Communication goes both ways. And, there are ways to handle these situations without angering anyone."
5025809,Shellback,2016-07-28 11:42:00,8083,"Hmmm? Come to think of it, it's a pretty common occurrence for me to fall through the bottom of a shower at camps I visit. I usually don't bother to tell the lodge owner at check out. I guess I'd better mention it next time in case he wants to give me a discount. I understand communicating with the lodge owner, but in the OP's case, the lodge owner was way off base not being proactive with the guest. Him not being proactive tells me he thinks poor or dangerous cabin conditions are a standard operating procedure."
5025873,bthomas3333,2016-07-28 12:07:00,465,"I have made over 30 trips to Canada Lodges / Outposts. I have seen relatively few issues, but here are a few and what happened.1. Fly-in that had really old nets. Falling apart. I mentioned that I had lost a fish when the fish ripped a hole in the old stringy net. The owner asked what kind of nets I liked to use. I suggested the cabelas pro series. 2 days later the owner had flown in all new nets for all the boats the exact same type of net from Fra-Bil. He probably spent $600 to fix the problem.2. Another Fly-in had rebuilt all the docks. When they did it raised the level of the dock making it tough for our older guys to get in and out of the boat. I asked if we could use the lower floatplane dock just for the older guys to get in and out of the boat. Said yes and the next year he installed beautiful iron handholds on the dock. Problem solved.3. At another lodge we struggled to get the foot control on the trolling motor to work. We mentioned it before dinner and they changed out the entire tolling motor while we ate.Couple of points. It you say something most good lodges are going to work their tail off to make it right. I agree telling them you fell through the floor should've resulted in a reduction in price, but my approach would've gone something like this: (ideally before I am standing their paying)""Hey X, I enjoyed the heck out of the fishery. Still had a good time, but the bathroom not working and the second accident really impacted how I feel about my trip. So, despite making the best of the situation I can't recommend the lodge or book another trip.""That's being honest and giving the owner a fair idea of how you feel. I would expect him/her to say ""hey what can I do to change your feelings about the trip/lodge"". If they say I'm sorry too bad. You gave them a chance to fix it. Then if you post negatives he/she shouldn't be surprised.At the end of the day asking for a discount is not a comfortable situation for most of us. I don't focus on the discount I focus on the problems that make your trip worth less than the advertised price.B-"
5025929,Fisherman Ted,2016-07-28 12:35:00,461,"Good points Brett.Here is a great example that I saw first-hand last year. A guest complained that his mattress sucked. I listened to the feedback and in the back of my mind was thinking wait a minute, we just replaced all of them and began to think this was just a high-maintenance client. Nevertheless I took note and as they were eating breakfast made a quick trip to his cabin to inspect personally.And low and behold I found one mattress that had been missed in the upgrade process. Man was I embarrassed. Not good. When they went fishing for the day we quickly went to town and swapped out a new mattress before happy hour.Had this guest not said something (and honestly, who says anything about a bad mattress I know I don't, I just chalk it up to part of the experience) I never would have known there was an issue. I was GRATEFUL he spoke up when he did. Because if he was not happy I am sure others had the same experience and went away thinking, gee...this Ted guy is a cheapskate when it comes to bedding. I need to know this stuff. We need to hear from you. A short note in an email is fine. Some of my best ideas for improvement come from my guests. Dozens actually.-FT"
5027729,Slushfish,2016-07-29 10:15:00,263,"I didn't throw them under bus because I believe they run a better operation than the one cabin that we experienced. Yesterday, I spoke with the owners and politely but honestly explained our issues. They apologized and offered us a newer cabin and free days if we decide to return next year. They expressed they would welcome our return and are trying to keep our return business. I feel better getting it off my chest and they were glad we gave them honest feedback instead of simply moving elsewhere."
5027793,Obabikon,2016-07-29 10:33:00,2370,Well done Slush... Mike is a very good person. Honesty and communication can resolve most problems!
5027825,bthomas3333,2016-07-29 10:57:00,465,Glad it worked out and most importantly no one got hurt. Falling through a floor naked makes me shudder at the thought.B-
5028713,pjshorthorn,2016-07-30 06:04:00,5654,"Lord Gord, You have about 7 hours left to finish the cabin renovation. We are on our way. I packed a pair of boots so my feet won't get muddy when standing on the ground in the shower. BTW, this is fair warning.......I'm not happy with our cabin and the washroom issues that we had to endure so I will be asking for a very deep discount on our rate for the week. : PjShorthorn."
5029377,v-bay gord,2016-07-30 15:47:00,3168,"Well, they are here. So far they have not noticed the ""Jolly Jumper"" set-up I have installed in the shower. Similar to a bouncing baby, this will support their bulky bodies while showering......keeping them from crashing through the floor. Wish me luck......."
5023833,Fisherman Ted,2016-07-27 15:26:00,461,"Yes I can read thanks. You should also read his note when he checked out. Nothing was said. Not by the owner and certainly not by the guest. The lodge owner said he would get the best cabin etc next year. So he thought all was good. Not very observant owner but that's not the point. If he thinks he made it right by hooking them up next year and the guests thinks otherwise then something needs to be said at checkout. Being silent does little. The lodge owner resolved the situation (he thought) by making sure it doesn't happen again and getting them a great cabin in 2017. His solution. Not ideal, but if you don't tell us we will never know if all is good. In every case if you as a guest do not like the solution to an issue then speak up! In this case the guy lost a new customer and is now getting flamed (albeit discretely) on a web-site. Every case is different. If something was said at check-out and that was STILL his answer (with nothing else to remedy the situation) then you as a customer make that decision to take your business elsewhere. Point being give us a chance to fix something. You would be surprised at the things we hear at the end of a trip that had I known about would have fixed immediately. For example, problems with a trolling motor, a boat seat, torn screen, leaking faucet. Whatever. Many operations are quite large with many moving parts and things get missed. Hey, that's life. Nearly every operator I know wants the best for our customers and if we missed something (law of averages says we will, sorry) a simple note, conversation or whatever will nearly always get it taken care of. -FT"
5024129,Shellback,2016-07-27 18:30:00,8083,"Sorry I don't buy it that the guest needed to speak up. Reading the OP's first post, he spoke of a group, including women using the cabin. They obviously picked a cabin with 2 baths to accommodate them. When they show up only one bath is operational. Strike one. If they advertise a cabin with 2 baths, they better be working. Sure, stuff happens, so if the 2nd bath just went down, tell your guest that you will adjust the price accordingly. Don't wait for him to speak up. Strike 2 was the only remaining bath falling apart. So if the guest is a nice guy, and doesn't complain, it's okay to charge him the regular rate? My opinion, this lodge owner knew exactly of the short comings of the cabin, when the guest said nothing, he figured he could get away with the full price. I had a less than acceptable accommodation last year myself. Paid in advance, drove 1100 miles and was like WTF, when showed my accommodation. I kept my mouth shut, because things would have got ugly, and I wasn't about to turn around and go home. I enjoyed my trip as best I could and left without saying a word. It was obvious in the OP's post, and in my situation, if anybody cleaned or checked out the place before arrival, they would have known of the problems. These weren't issues that just happened and were unknown to the lodge owner because he wasn't told. Offering the best cabin next year? Not a chance on my part. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me."
5024529,farmnfish,2016-07-27 21:09:00,130,"Does that mean if you're that particular lodges best customer, book their best cabin every year, you're going to get bumped if the op decides to come back that week? Humm... Sounds like a hollow promise in lieu of making it right."
5024561,v-bay gord,2016-07-27 21:43:00,3168,"Just remember that in most things, like running a lodge, there is a learning curve. Without feedback most of us will continue to do stupid things. On the bright side I have yet to have someone tell me a story about falling through the floor while having a shower......now, that's almost worth full price just for the stories you can tell when you're old and grey....... PJ.....if I can rig up a trap door in the shower before you arrive you to will have a similar fabulous adventure......."
5024657,pjshorthorn,2016-07-28 04:51:00,5654,"Why not. While you are at it, why don't you just add one of those coin operated gizmos on the shower so that I have to pay to use the toilet and the shower. Better yet, just double the cost of getting into the washroom and save yourself that bit of extra work. I mean, if I'm going to get horked for paying to use a washroom, I might as well get the FULL horked treatment. With the upgrades and up charges for our cabin this week, I assume you will be invoking the little fine print at the bottom of the lodge's rate sheet whereby lodging rates can change at any time without notice and to top it off, you'll be charging us in US funds. I've got two more days to get ""all lathered up"" about the shower thing so I'll just start my list of ""constructive feedback"" now PjShorthorn."
5024777,grizzley,2016-07-28 05:45:00,2518,"I'm wondering about the patch it up and rent it next year post, very possible. We used to stay in a cabin in Maine, the roof leaked a little in the one bedroom, we had to knock the stalagmite down in the outhouse that almost came up to the seat, no running water, one year we didn't have power. Two of the guys went over to pay the fee for 8 of us, it was at the lodge the guy owned and he said you boys want a beer, the one put money on the bar and he took it, the other asked if he paid for his beer, and he said I don't think so, so the other guy put money out and the owner took the price of the beer out of it. This guy couldn't even give the two of them a free beer after they just handed him a pile of money, also this ""rustic"" cabin cost more than some others in the area. We drew the line on staying at that cabin after the owners wife got shot and killed in it, he didn't rent it out for a year or two, but after that we saw other hunters staying there. After the year without power, he said that someone had put the fuses in backwards, I don't think you can put double ended buss fuses in backwards! Talk about greed!"

You stay in a dump and and almost injure yourself because of poor maintenance and you don't want to throw someone under the bus????

5024889,v-bay gord,2016-07-28 06:27:00,3168,"""Crap"" is such a harsh term Al. Just remember that back when all these old cabins were built people were not so tubby. These days when floors are built, they are able to withstand the tonnage. I sometimes cringe when people lower themselves into a chair in the lodge. While the arms on the chair are one axe handle wide, their rear ends are two axe handles. They often leave with the chair stuck to their butts...... More than once I've had to chase down PJ and Gramps to retrieve my lodge furniture."
5024985,Shellback,2016-07-28 06:58:00,8083,"Stuff happens unexpectedly, that's a given. Maybe guests don't mention a problem and the lodge owner never knows. I can understand these things. But in this case, the guest was told the cabin is being torn down at the end of the season! I'd have to think, no according to the OP, it was in a poor and unsafe condition. So report to the lodge owner you had a problem with something he may not be aware of, sure. One bathroom not operational, and falling through the floor of another, and not aware of the condition? Well maybe if the lodge owner was Stevie Wonder."
5025513,Jesse-WI,2016-07-28 09:55:00,534,I run into business people all the time that lack common sense. I also run into business people that do not understand customer service. This is why as a customer you need complain smartly as soon as feel something is wrong. You also need to be reasonable with proposed remedies.

5013081,Obabikon,2016-07-22 21:36:00,2370,"As a lodge owner, I can say that every single one of us is different. Some are great to work with, some are difficult. Some are hands on, some are book keepers. Some are all about the life style, and some are all about financials. Every resort has a ""feel"" to it. Find the one that feels right for you. In this case though, how the owner responds to the situation should tell you all you need to know. You shouldn't even have to ask for a huge discount... it should just be there."
5020737,Freytown,2016-07-26 12:21:00,770,"Looking at your earlier posts, it appears you stayed at Sunset Cove @ LOTW. Did he make good or not. Since you started this thread, you should finish it. Just sayin'."
5023073,Slushfish,2016-07-27 10:18:00,263,"Knowing the negative effects a post like this can have, I've decided against throwing anyone under the bus. To make a long story short, we stayed for the rest of our planned stay, and had a great time. Upon checking out, not a word was said about anything that happened. We were offered our pick of cabins if we come back next year. Had a great time and liked the hosts, just disappointed in the cabin. Not sure I could convince the others to return next year. If so, it certainly wouldn't be in that cabin. I really was hoping this was going to be our new camp... guess I'll keep looking."
5023377,Fisherman Ted,2016-07-27 12:50:00,461,"As a lodge owner you need to speak up and say something. Especially when you have decided not to come back! If the lodge owner does not know of your displeasure, and thinks you will come back nothing will change. Be nice, honest and up-front. This was a specific incident and has a direct result. In this case let them know that you will likely not return etc. The ball is now in their court to make it right. If they think they will lose your business most lodge owners will go to great lengths to make it right. I would want to know any and all problems, especially one of this magnitude. -FT"
5023441,LOW1,2016-07-27 13:24:00,2828,"It seems to me that the resort owner is the one who should be proactive in this situation and should be making it right without the guest having to say anything, especially since the problem was well known to the owner at checkout.I suspect that Slushfish handled the matter with more discretion and class than I would have."
5023513,Fisherman Ted,2016-07-27 13:39:00,461,but he said nothing was said upon checkout and that he will not return. Something needs to be said especially to a lodge owner that appears to be obtuse. We are not all mind readers. He also went on to say that the lodge owner said he would put them in his best cabin so in the owner's eyes all is good when in fact it is just the opposite.

Now, obviously the owner should be making some accommodation..........but, the op seems to be an easy going person, who seemed to have a great trip. Perhaps the owner is thinking this is the case and hopes that an offer of the pick of the cabins for next year is sufficient. There's nothing wrong with saying you had a great trip but.....because of the problems you thought some discount would have been offered, and you are likely not to return.

4998113,brad34,2016-07-18 08:33:00,892,A significant discount without question. The owner has a lot of nerve if he's charging you the same rate as the other cabins to begin with.
4998553,jokerjim,2016-07-18 11:50:00,473,A large discount is in order. If you don't receive one that would be the time to name the resort owner !!

If he won't budge, I'd see if there is a chamber of commerce, and complain to them, and post his name on this site.

5003473,Shellback,2016-07-20 05:34:00,8083,"If you can't come to a reasonable settlement with the lodge owner, I'd check to see if the locality has a building code and inspection agency.

4997881,Slushfish,2016-07-18 07:11:00,263,"Let me start by with some background. For the last eight years, we've stayed at the same cabins but, last year they closed. We searched around and found another camp close by that seemed nice for not too much more money. Booked the last cabin they had for two weeks. Invited my brother and sister in law which they gladly accepted. Upon arrival, we see that the cabins aren't quite as nice as what they looked in the pics. No big deal. You could throw a small kitten through any of the screens. Well, the windows that had screens. Cabin was supposed to have three bedrooms, two baths. One bathroom wasn't functional. No big deal, we are in Canada. At that our host tells us this is the oldest cabin in camp, planning on tearing it down after this season. At the end of week one, the floor of the one functional shower completely fell apart, with me in it, falling 3' down into the crawlspace that the shower has been leaking into for the last 20 years. YUCK! At this point it's all I can do to keep the ladies from packing up and going to another camp. That afternoon, a storm blows through, water leaks through the roof, down the wall, all over the closet floor soaking everything in it. Now we have four days left, hardly worth spending a day moving to another camp, if we could find one. Supposably, a plumber is coming this morning to fix the shower with a floor left. How do I handle this? We were hoping for this to be our new home away from home but, the first impression isn't going so well. Do we hope he'll knock some money off? Tell him it's unacceptable? He doesn't have another cabin to put us in. Any advice on how to handle this much appreciated."
4997905,LLewellin,2016-07-18 07:22:00,1790,"Wait till your done with your stay and then ask him what he thinks that kind of stay is worth? Also go look at a couple of other cabins before you talk to him so you can compare. To me he NEVER should have rented that cabin to anyone unless he for warned you of the problems. If he still wants more than you think its worth ...... tell him how much you are willing to pay take it or leave it! To me it should be absolutely FREE! IMHOSimilar situation happened to me antelope hunting in Montana years ago. We were staying at a motel for a week and had absolutely ""0"" hot water for showers at the end of the day. The owner kept saying that a plumber was coming to fix it. He wanted full price. He was paid 15-20% of the total which was more than he should have IMHO."
4997921,Obabikon,2016-07-18 07:29:00,2370,"That's a tough one. I always take money off when guests experience problems. I've never had someone go through a floor though. Yikes! At the very least, there should be a discount. But, you shouldn't even have to ask for it.... he should just take it off."
4997929,123chadder,2016-07-18 07:35:00,429,"id be asking for a big discount,that is unacceptable,and dangerous....is there electricity in the cabins?"
4997945,v-bay gord,2016-07-18 07:38:00,3168,"Pretty embarrassing. Check out the other cabins and maybe suggest you would be interested in next year. There should be a discount in your future.....hopefully the owner does it and you don't have to ask. There are other places to stay......As a side note and observation, no owner worth his salt would need to hire a plumber to fix the problem you describe. Probably an indication of the skill level he has to perform routine maintenance. Just a consideration."
4997985,LLewellin,2016-07-18 07:49:00,1790,My question would be how bad does he want you for a future customer? Proof will be in the pudding.
4998057,Slushfish,2016-07-18 08:13:00,263,"Yes, there is electricity. Thanks Obabikon, I appreciate the input from another owner. I'm not out to bash anyone. That's why I'm not naming the camp but, we are not too far from you. We stayed in a different cabin the first night and it was nice. Would like to stay here again but, he's going to have to make this trip right to even consider it."
4998073,LOW1,2016-07-18 08:18:00,2828,I'd get whatever discount I could but never go back unless you were absolutely certain that things would be better next year..I suspect that the owner knew or at least should have known a lot more about the problem cabin than he is letting on. Who doesn't know or care about no window screens? The lack of pride the owner shows in the problem cabin is likely to transfer over to his other cabins and services.And he may likely rent the problem cabin next year and tell those renters that he will be tearing it down the year after that.Posting a negative review would be appropriate.There's a reason many resorts go out of business.
4998089,Jimmy Jig,2016-07-18 08:24:00,1905,"My guess is, you will not get any discount................."
