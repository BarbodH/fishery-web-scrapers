5029681,Pooch,2016-07-30 20:08:00,4619,Why do the fish on Lac Seul relate so much to sand and the sand banks?What insect is hatching there at different times of the early summer to attract walleye to those areas?On our late summer trip there is not much reason to fish the sand banks areas. I don't catch fish there except at bottom transition areas and then not numbers. Sometimes smallies though. Just thinking about it. One life long Lac Seul resident once told me that some type of insect (not mayflies) or grub was there and might be the attraction as they hatch or emerge from the bottom.Does anyone have on good authority what goes on there?Pooch

Smelt, emerald shiners, etc congregate there to eat the bugs. Walleyes eat both. Follow the food, u will find the fish. The bug hatch usually slows way down the later u get into summer"
