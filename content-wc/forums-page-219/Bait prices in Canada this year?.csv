4909153,Dakota Floyd,2016-06-07 18:23:00,62,We just got back. Leeches were $ 24.99 per half pound and minnows were $ 5.50 a dozen by Sioux lookout. We are currently looking into cheaper alternatives. Good luck

4909833,Dakota Floyd,2016-06-08 04:53:00,62,We did. Leeches in Fort Francis. The bait shop on the way out of town on the left. Not sure on the name. The minnows we bought were at the gas station at the turn to Hudson. Seems like we get charged a different price each time we go there.
4909921,Timber Edge,2016-06-08 05:41:00,8,Hello Dakota Floyd my prices are the same as last year $42 a pound for leeches and $4 a dozen for minnows I am the owner/operator of Timber Edge Camps about 12 miles south of Sioux Lookout on Minnitaki 3 miles north of Donnely's by highway.
