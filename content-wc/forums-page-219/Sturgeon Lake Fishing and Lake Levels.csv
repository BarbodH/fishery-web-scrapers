Would be great if someone was going by there and returning somewhere near the Twin Cities. Whiskey Jack's is on the NW side of the lake up 599, before White Sands."

Also have some 1 ounce rock-a-roo type hair jigs tipped with a minnow. I have used a 1 ounce blue and silver cast master also , cast it out a ways and let it flutter to the bottom. Usually get hit on the way down. We used to down rig , but jigging is way more fun."
