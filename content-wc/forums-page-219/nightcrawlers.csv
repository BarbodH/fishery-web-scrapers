4983361,Clarence1,2016-07-12 13:35:00,29,"FF, That seems about right for cost. I also can get flats in WI for $60-$80. The problem wasn't getting them in the states, it was the risk of having to dump at the border because of a fleck of dirt in the container. After having to do that once , I decided Canada wins and I will buy in Canada. But now I am crossing border further west in Minnesota and they are very difficult to come by in that area of Canada. If you do find a flat they want $125-$140 CAN. and in poor shape. That's almost 1/4 cost of my total island lodging, and outside my budget. Thanks, FF"
4983497,Carnhzkr,2016-07-12 15:16:00,964,"I haven't called either place to confirm, but from previous posts it appears you can get crawlers and other bait from the Marina or Buena Vista Resort in Morson. I don't know the price, nor have I confirmed availability, but I wouldn't be concerned about crossing the border with a ""Canada Pack"" of crawlers. I've done that many times at I'Falls and have never had any issue. Of course, they've never inspected the bait, just asked if I had any and I'd tell 'em I have crawlers packed in commercial bedding."
4984049,The tank,2016-07-12 19:02:00,340,The worms we got from Steves are packed in bedding if you tell them they're going to Canada. It's just me and my wife here this week so I got a half a flat and it was $37. So I assume it $70 plus tax for a flat. They didn't even ask about bait at the border this year.
4984833,farmnfish,2016-07-13 06:49:00,130,"Does bobby's in vermillion bay sell 1/2 flats, what's the current price?"
5027617,Clarence1,2016-07-29 09:47:00,29,"Thanks for the replies. We ended up finding a 500 count flat of crawlers in town of Rainy across border from Baudette Mn. A fellow by the name of Earl Corey sells them from his home. turn south on 6th street in Rainy (town about a block and a half. Cant miss the sighns. Call ahead if flats required as he doesn't keep a lot around. He has a small bait shop in what used to be his garage. The crawlers were fresh , fat and sassy. Paid a little bit more than the states would have been (around $80.00) US dollar, but didn't have to dump at the border like I have had to in the past. Now that US side is preparing in ""Canada Packs"" I may try US purchase again one more time. Earl also sells minnows by the bag and is generous with his dozen. In other words he scoops instead of counts. Most Canadian minnow sales are counted to the exact dozen. We purchased about 25 dozen and probably got about 30 dozen. I wont fool with minnow again, as we do as well or better with crawlers, but for those that insist on minnows, he does sell them and puts them in bags with oxygen, so they do keep well in refridge if not opened."
4918945,Mr Ranger,2016-06-12 06:29:00,272,Picking ours up in Wausa next week. $74 dollars for a flat of 500 in Canada pack.
4919369,phishfearme,2016-06-12 09:44:00,1242,"does the ""Canada pack"" include that ""Blue ice"" packs to keep em cold?"
4920033,michigan walleye guy,2016-06-12 13:48:00,95,"What about just ordering a flat of crawlers from Cabela's? What is the quality of those crawlers? I, personally, would much rather fish with leeches than crawlers, due to the ""mess"" factor. I did purchase a 1/2 flat of crawlers in Nestor Falls last year, but was less than impressed with the quality. Crawlers were very small and less than healthy. Won't make that mistake again."
4921033,Mr Ranger,2016-06-12 18:39:00,272,"Our canada pack is just in bedding, not the usual black dirt. We add our own ice blocks."
4923977,lawson2343,2016-06-13 15:39:00,459,"We bought a flat of crawlers in Buss bedding for $56. My cousin then rebeds them in Frabill and adds food. I swear the crawlers we had this year could catch the fish for us! They were bruisers. We started doing this so that we could check on the crawlers before it was too late. About 4 years ago the flat we picked up in Canada was full of worms and the crawlers were pathetic. The box started to go bad about the third day of the trip. Had to go through the box and rebed the good ones. One other tip. Read on WC before the trip this year about ""rinsing crawlers"" for use in the boat. We did it and it was fantastic. No mess and the crawlers were still cold late in the afternoon. Search for ""rinsing crawlers""."
4981025,Clarence1,2016-07-11 11:27:00,29,"I am having a hard time finding a flat in Canada with the route I need to take. I'm Crossing at Baudette/Rainy. Would like to buy in Canada to avoid having to dump them(as I was required to do a few years ago) even though I washed them and in put paper bedding. Border agent found what I assume was worm ""droppings"" and decided that was enough dirt to reject them. Anyone know where I could get a flat between Rainy (town) and Morson?"
4981033,fishron,2016-07-11 11:36:00,317,"We cross at the Thousand Island Bridge. It's a tradition to stop at the Thousand Island bait store and pick up crawlers. They sell a tremendous number along with leeches and minnows, and a zillion lures I don't need. I always check the container for quality. Got burned once. That was enough. The're always packed in paper (non soil) bedding"
4981897,The tank,2016-07-11 18:10:00,340,None that I know of. There's a home made sign in rainy river that someone sells bait not sure where. We get them front steves lucky bait in baudette and never had a problem at the boarder.
4982705,Clarence1,2016-07-12 08:09:00,29,"Tank, I was wondering about that Steve's bait place. Does he already have them in (non - dirt) bedding, sort of ""border crossing ready"", or do you clean them and put in your own bedding before crossing? Yesterday, I did find that guy that sells from his garage in Rainy (town) across the border, but it seems a pain to him and to me. He's just not set up for flats. Leaving this Friday, Thanks"
4982865,Fishin Fun,2016-07-12 09:35:00,218,I just ordered a flat from Cabelas and they said $78.
4744290,nancy39,2016-04-17 11:59:00,23,can you take live nightcrawlers to canada in paper bedding?
4744306,greenie,2016-04-17 12:15:00,87,"Yes, but NO dirt."
4744394,SILVER MINNOW BAIT SHOP,2016-04-17 12:51:00,18,"Just out of curiosity...why wouldnt you buy them in Canada? Are they cheaper in the states. Again, just curious. Ps- you can bring them in as long as they are not in soil.Thanks,Josh"
4744458,cruiseforever,2016-04-17 13:13:00,177,They are free on my yard after a rain. I like to be able to monitor the quality of my crawlers.
4744730,SILVER MINNOW BAIT SHOP,2016-04-17 16:14:00,18,Oh ya!! That makes sense...I wasnt even thinking of someone picking their own!Does anyone know how much a flat sells for in the states tho?
4744850,JayM5209,2016-04-17 17:26:00,1050,"In my area, $50-$60 per flat, plus shipping if ordered on line.For trips to NW Ontario I always order ahead by phone and pick them up in Perrault Falls."
4746026,camp chef,2016-04-18 07:40:00,915,Last year we paid $80 a flat in MInnesota on the way in. We boat into Canada through voyagers national park so that is are last place to get bait.
4752066,SILVER MINNOW BAIT SHOP,2016-04-19 14:22:00,18,Ok so with the exchange the price is very similar. Thanks for the info!
4752290,Bstar,2016-04-19 15:25:00,564,"Yes you can as long as they're in bedding but why bother. We used to haul nightcrawlers in from Northwest Indiana but then we got smart and bought them at Rainy Lake Sports in Fort Frances. You can pre order and they are fresh and lively. You don't have to worry about them getting too warm,etc. The cost wasn't that much more than buying them in the states especially if you have a large group."
4918433,Guest,2016-06-11 19:08:00,0,The crawlers we purchased at the lodge were pathetic. I'll be bringing my own next time. Minnows were very small too. Can't do anything about that though.
