Just checking, no big deal we can purchase what we need in Dryden but more convenient for us on the way up to not have to stop and shop on an already very long day. Thanks, Milfish"
5029073,Babamel2,2016-07-30 11:32:00,414,I believe there is still a ban on eggs from Indiana. I suggest checking the Canadian government website on restricted items
