I'm trying to find an outfitter for a group of 4 friends. We are interested in pike and walleye fishing wroth decent accommodations and camp boats. Sent from my SCH-I545 using Tapatalk

That said, I do know the type of water is very similar. The lake may be the most gorgeous body of water I have ever fished, but you better know what you're doing because she can also be very treacherous. The lake is strewn with marked and unmarked reefs. Knowing how to reed a map is very important so as to navigate in the channels. When moving outside the channels do so with extreme caution. Having a lookout in the front of the boat with polarized glasses can help but as the water is tannin stained one can only see a foot or so into the water in some conditions. As for an outfitter you may want to check out Memquisit Lodge. If Frank can't help you he should be able to recommend someone who can. http://www.memquisitlodge.net/"
