We usually fish gullrock so i know the area. So looking to fish that area and red lake area i guess or any other thoughts. We cook ourselves..need boat and motor. Wouldnt mind staying at a place a few days then moving to another location as well. Maybe even a fly in for a few days? Also heard the pickle lake area has some good places but have never been that area. Might be hard to move around but might be able to make it work as well from camp to camp. Thanks in advance."

I had it in my mind I was going to go out on Red to the west end, but never got around to it. I would be a lodge owner could setup just about anything for you. Ian at Five Lakes is a great guy."
5031401,johnboat,2016-07-31 21:09:00,2014,15 years in at Five Lakes Lodge. Group of at least 10. We haul up 20 ft boats so running to Red would be easy. Every year we say we are running to Red Lake to fish it but never have cause there is absolutely no need to leave Gullrock. Ask Ian about his outpost lakes. Might be a nice change for you. Couple nice day trips for fishing and exploring. Gets you out deep in the bush.
