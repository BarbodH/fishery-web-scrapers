The lodge is located about 7 miles out on the lake. I've stayed in the lodge twice. The walleye fishing can range from extraordinary, to cold, to extraordinary all in one day. Separation is part of the English River system and there ares with current and then areas of wide lake with little current. The lake is full of reefs, rock piles and other hazards. There are a couple of areas where the water comes from 100 feet to 2 feet like a cliff. So be careful motoring around. The key good fishing is to find the pinch points where there is a slight current flowing. The lodge will supply you with a well marked map for fish and some of the hazards. There is lots of area to fish. Spend some time hitting the weed beds in the many small bays with cranks. The big walleyes sometimes like those areas. These areas also hold lots of good sized pike. Every now and then a 40 plus incher will hit. I never have thought much of the smallmouth fishing, but they are there.....so they say. There is very little competition for spots form other boats while you are out on the lake. The lodge is nice and well run. It has new owners. I haven't been there since they took over. We are heading up there to stay in the campground Sept. 5th."
