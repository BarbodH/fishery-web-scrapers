5023633,tv4fish,2016-07-27 14:14:00,2694,Thanks for your post:https://satmodo.com/rental/?gclid=CK...FYQAaQodEc4J4Q
5025225,Rlcrouse,2016-07-28 08:15:00,286,"$75 for the phone is cheap. Compare that to the price of what's in your tackle box that you never use for the week. Plus, you're wife will love it when she knows you're dropping $1-2 a min just to hear her voice while you're gone. Lol"
5025913,1K1MOA,2016-07-28 12:26:00,90,"I was doing a solo fly-in last year July for a week and thought ""nah, I want the disconnect"" on bringing a sat phone. 72 hours before departure I ended up in the hospital with a 9MM kidney stone blocking the top of my bladder. It had to be removed surgically. The Urologist, when he heard about my trip plans, said I probably would have been so septic I would not have made it more than 3 days. Yes, solo trips at my age are over and yes, fly-ins will have sat communications (phone or InReach) in the kit going forward. You just never know what could happen."
5027153,falconman,2016-07-29 06:55:00,12,Thanks for all the replies. Im now convinced that a sat phone is the way to go. Just hoping I don't have to use it.
5029241,forgop,2016-07-30 13:59:00,880,"I second Mike's recommendation for an inReach device. This is my 2nd year using one and it's about $80-90/year to pay the annual fee and month of unlimited texting. It also has an SOS option for providing real coordinates for an emergency-something that bulky sat phone isn't going to do. You can also purchase insurance for the need of a medical evacuation or rescue for a nominal fee. For younger people and those not likely to do something dumb, it's an unnecessary expense. Those who are more ""mature"" and have more chronic health conditions, it's probably a nominal expense for a group to share. Easy piece of mind to stay in easy contact with home and family and should you prefer to be more off the grid, you can turn it on/off at your discretion."
5015985,falconman,2016-07-24 09:41:00,12,"Just wondering if anybody takes a satellite phone with them when on a remote fly in? The outfitter Im going with offers one for rent, just wondering what peoples thoughts are on them...for emergencies only."
5016033,pete kraft,2016-07-24 09:55:00,28,Wouldn't go in without one. Cheap insurance in case something goes wrong
5016049,Duflebag,2016-07-24 10:02:00,218,Got back from my remote fly in this week. I would not have gone if i didn't have a satellite phone. We have had too many incidents to not have that insurance with us just in case. Good luck on your trip.
5016113,falconman,2016-07-24 10:18:00,12,"Thanks guys. They want $75 to rent, which isn't bad for peace of mind."
5016273,Mike Borger,2016-07-24 11:15:00,1554,"I bought a Delorme inReach satellite communication device. About the size of a hand held gps, you can send/receive emails and texts anywhere in the world.I'm off the grid way more than most, so my needs may be a little different. I couldn't function without this, it's essential. FAR cheaper than using a sat phone.http://delorme.com/"
5016329,octanehi5,2016-07-24 11:43:00,1104,"Have been renting one every yr for more than 10 yrs. Even had to use it a few times, priceless on that kind of tripo"
5016577,smithcr1981,2016-07-24 14:44:00,42,$75 dollars is a steal. if the outfitter does not have a two way radio then the sat phone is a must. i rented one two years ago for my trip. i think it cost $130 for the week and came with 15 free minutes. the free minutes was kind of cool as we all have young kids and they thought it was cool to talk to us that far away.
5016857,BornToFish,2016-07-24 18:32:00,1224,"Greetings, I have only one experience with a satellite phone. I tried making a telephone call with it. I had to keep walking around the camp's property to find a place where the satellite phone would work, as it didn't work in just any place. Then, the call was repeatedly dropped such that I gave up in frustration. I agree with the previous posts that $75 would be cheap insurance. But, based on my single data point, I encourage you to ask your outfitter if the phone will work wherever it is that you are going. I would be inclined to take the offer if they can assure you that the satellite phone will work should you need to use it. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5016881,Skywagon,2016-07-24 18:51:00,1106,"I have heard horror stories of things that have happened at remote camps, a sat phone could possibly save someone's life. Anything from a broken bone to a heart attack could conceivable happen. This summer a local drive-in resort had one of their clients pass away while at camp. I don't think anyone would want to deal with a situation like that for a week at a remote outpost cabin, waiting days for the plane to come..... I carry an Iridium sat phone with me at all times when in the bush, a Delorme InReach is also a good alternative that works well, I am personally not impressed with the Spot system for our area."
5023561,keek,2016-07-27 13:55:00,1003,I rent from a place down in Florida. $35 a week. Each minute of talking costs $1. Satellite Phone Solutions is the name. Been using them for years. Very happy with them. Phone comes shipped in it's own waterproof Pelican Box.
