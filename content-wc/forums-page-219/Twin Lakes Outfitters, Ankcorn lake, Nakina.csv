Its been since 2011 when the whole family went to Eastern Ontario for our first fishing trip, note that this trip its only one of my sons and I this time. A learning experience for the balance of the family, but one they don't choose to repeat. Obviously, our choice of outfitter this time is moving us further West in Ontario, as Im hoping for better fishing. I cant wait, everything is mapped out and Im hoping we wont forget anything being that its a fly in. Any input from anybody who's fished the area recently would be appreciated. As of now we are stocked up on the usual jigs, spoons and stick baits for walleye and pike."

5015961,onetimedave,2016-07-24 09:34:00,502,No restaurant in Nakina. Closest is Long Lac or Gearldton. Have eaten at Long Lac Pizza which is a full service rest. Behind the pharmacy which is on the South side or main route East/West.

Consider bringing frozen, salted minnows, 10 Doz per person to be legal, and basic jigs; those should cover you on the walleye. Northern baits are spoons and spinners. Our hot rig was inline spinner with 4"" white or bubblegum twister tail. For fun, run a spook or jitterbug on the surface late day, especially if a little wind. They will clobber it on the surface and your heart WILL pound."
