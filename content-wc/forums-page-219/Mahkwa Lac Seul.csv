5022449,Dakota Floyd,2016-07-27 06:18:00,62,Wondering if anyone has stayed there this year. I have a trip coming up in a couple of weeks and will be staying there with my kids. Also wondering if anyone has any spots they wouldn't mind sharing. We typically fish east of there. We have fished as far west as Pine and would like to try some new areas this year. Thanks for the help

5030681,Skiball,2016-07-31 13:53:00,82,"Good Luck. We've been going to Mahkwa for 22 years but we go up in sept. Try the SW end of Windigo in 18 to 35 ft. Best in the am. LaSalle Island, the larger Northerly island has always been a good producer from 20 to 40 ft. Good chances for big fish. Ask at Mahkwa to show you where the Mission is. There is an area that runs from 18 to 100 ft and there are fingers out there you would have to find with your electronics that looks like fingers on a hand and they come up to about 18 ft, depending on water levels and drop on both sides well into the 30's. Its east of Wesley pt in the middle. Wesley Point can be good as well for eaters. If you want to steam out, try Pine Point which is NE of Mahkwa and if you continue from there, there is Bishop's Rock and Pauli Light and you can scope out all those little islands for structure. Its a haul from mahkwa but could be worth it. Remember , we go 2nd week of sept. So check the temps and water levels and don't be afraid to ask. They're great at Mahkwa. Again......GOOD LUCK..................skiball"
