Might have to boil the water, or take a pure water pitcher and a couple of filters. It has worked for us for years now. HEY you gotta rough it a little!!! Have a good trip."

Even if they have a state of the art filter system, I believe they need to have it regularly tested to declare it potable (drinkable). Something I believe is expensive to do. The requirements may even be more stringent, not sure.Seanik stayed there in 2012, maybe he can help.https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...ghlight=kayveeWe always stay in White River. Not sure what's in Hornpayne, I doubt much if anything.Also, we normally pre-fly in our beverages. So, that might be an option if you're concerned about weight."

Fill with water , hang on wall( nail , hook or whatever), place a clean water pitcher in 5 gallon bucket on the floor . We do 3-4 pitchers . Coffee water, drink mixes etc. The reason for placing pitcher in bucket, is that when you get busy in a cabin and forget about it , you won't have water all over the floor."

It is not certified as it is very expensive to have inspections etc. The filter system is one that would be certified if tested. We have used the water for making gatorade and other powdered drinks. Uncle's in Hornepayne is the only restaurant I know of in town. It did not get high marks from the incoming groups that stayed there before their fly-in. They seem to be rented long term to construction workers and then to travelers when the workers are out on the road. Rooms dirty, no clean linens or towels, etc."

4979313,kzoofisher,2016-07-10 16:37:00,5144,We take a gravity filter with us and it works great. Platypus makes one that has its own bag for clean water so we don't need the pots or jars does over 2 gallons in a few minutes. Does not remove 100% of the local flavor but filters all bacteria Etc. We take a few bottles for use around the cabin and in boats.
