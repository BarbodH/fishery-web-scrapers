4958473,pjshorthorn,2016-06-30 10:02:00,5654,"Howdy Folks,I was very fortunate this season to be invited by Breezy Point to make a trip to LOTW and explore the Sabaskong Bay complex on a new Canadian adventure. Breezy has made somewhere around 60 trips to LOTW,with a large portion of those trips spent with Mike and Anne Bartlett at Redwing Lodge out of the Morson area. Of course, that was our destination lodge for this trip!Never having been to LOTW, I really didn't know what to expect. In studying a map of Sabaskong Bay prior to my departure, it was quite apparent that the lake system was a vast fishery with many different opportunities to catch multiple species. Breezy made sure to feed me some interesting facts about the acreage of the lake, miles of shoreline, 14,500 islands to fish ( probably just as many reefs too- hold that thought for now) and some outstanding scenery on a lake averaging 25 -30 fow. After a couple bumpy plane rides from Atlanta to Brained,MN we made tracks for the border on Saturday the 18th. Since we were not in a big hurry, we took a more scenic route from Breezy Point to Baudette through the northern Minnesota woods. Simply put, it is gorgeous land. We did have one small detour on Hwy 72 just outside of Baudette. The detour signage can be a little confusing so if anyone decides to cross there you will have to take a route that goes behind few local businesses and down a residential street to get back to the main road leading to the crossing . I would say it may be an extra 5 -10 minutes of travel via the detour. At the border we encountered the longest line we've ever seen in Baudette with approximately 30 -40 vehicles ahead of us. I would venture to say it took us 30 minutes to get to the officer's booth. The questions were pretty normal covering booze,guns,where ya going,etc. They did ask about bait and we told them we had crawlers in bedding and 215 salted minnows. The officer chuckled, and asked "" You actually counted the minnows ? "". We indicated that we wanted to make sure we were legal on salted minnows and we were on our way in two minutes with a smile from a very polite and professional border agent. I guess this is what you get when an IT guy and an engineer plan a trip together ....After a couple of stops in Rainy River to pick up 4 lbs of Tenderflake lard for momma (homemade pie crusts) and a few extra Canadian beverages we had a short 30 minute drive to Redwing Lodge. As a side note,upon purchasing said beverages, I was informed by a fishing partner who shall remain unnamed , that I may have bought a little too much for one person. The strangest thing happened during the week; we ended up taking home a paltry few........must have been just about the right amount for two fishermen..... Upon arrival, we were quickly greeted by Mike and Anne and I was immediately made to feel as if I had been visiting the lodge for as long as Breezy has. It didn't take us long to get unpacked and ready the boat for launch. While we were getting our act together, I quickly came to understand how important these trips are to Breezy and his desire to show me a good time on his home lake. I got ""the speech"". "" Just so you know Pat, I'm going to pull rank on you here. We are going to a small bay close to camp and pull Hot -n- Tots. I have had good luck there and no one ever fishes that spot. "" Sure, why not.......who am I as a newbie to question that plan? I have to admit, it did change my plans to lash an inflatable sheep to the bow of Breezy''s boat at some point during the trip. I mean,this was serious fishing stuff all of a sudden...... Note to self, don't forget about the sheep thing for future tripsSaturday afternoon/evening could not have been better with a slightly overcast sky, comfortable temps,light winds and 66 degree water temps.We started in the unnamed bay that Breezy wanted to target and we never left it the remainder of the day. We pulled Hot-n- Tots ( 2"" size) in chartruese and metallic blue in 5-7 fow across rock points and weed edges at 2.2-2.4 mph. This is also where I learned what Breezy calls "" pimple fishing"". We trolled over "" pimples"" ( a sharp rising reef that is fairly small in width ) and immediately picked up fish,as well as, rocky points and the weed beds. We arrived at the height of the mayfly hatch and the water was thick with floating mayflies. The hatch didn't impact our ability to catch nice eater walleyes and sauger. We could have brought a limit home in just the few hours we were out that evening.We had some highlights from the outing that included myself catching my first ever smallie , Breezy raised a musky off an exposed reef that had a mouth as big as a small basketball, he landed a 47"" spotted muskie trolling in ""no man's land"" when were ""pimple hopping"", 5 quality northern which included a couple of 33""+ fish and enough walleye to keep a few solid 16-17""walleyes to have for a Father's Day dinner the next evening.Father's Day came with stormy weather in the morning so were were happy to wait out the thunder and rain until the front passed. We had planned on making a trip up to Turtle Lake sometime during the week to fish a few spots offered up by Bill Krejca ,as well as, hang a sign to honor Bill's father Al. For those of you that haven't read Bill's book, "" A North Woods Fisherman Story "", I would highly recommend it. A very nice easy read, chronicling a gentleman's adventures on LOTW. This day turned into an exploratory trip, fishing our way up to Turtle Lake, myself getting a grand tour of Sabaskong Bay and finding a great spot to hang my Little Rascals sign in remembrance of Bill's Dad that had traversed the area on so many trips over the last 80 years. It was a great Father's Day even though fishing slowed down with the weather coming through. We had a wet ride back to the lodge , dodging another thunderstorm , as the winds started to build. Water temps held at 66 degrees and all fish were caught in 7-10 fow.Overnight a good sized cold front blew through and fishing became quite a challenge as winds were 15-25 mph with gusts of 30-35 mph over the next two days. We hid behind islands trying to drift water that had enough lee and wind to bounce floating jigs and crawlers off the bottom. This was where we experienced the only negative aspect of the trip. We had just got set up on a nice drift behind an island ,drifting towards shore, after picking up a couple of fish and around the point comes 5 boats following one another wide open. I looked at Breezy and said ,"" Please tell me they aren't going to try and shoot the gap between us and the island."" Yup,they did. Passing by us about 100 ft. away under full power. In the lead was a Buena Vista Lodge guide boat with guests being followed by another 4 boats of guests. Needless to say, I won't be looking at the lodge for future trips. The guide had an easy alternate path on the opposite side of the island with 1/4- 1/2 mile of distance to decide which way to go. As you can imagine, fishing was done on that spot.On Tuesday we fished behind Rabbit Point to stay out of the wind and had limited success. Since we were pretty close to Obabikon Bay Camp,we decided to run over to see if Jared was around and just say hello. After a wet ride across the open water we made it to Obabikon and pulled up to a dock. A young man greeted us and asked what he could do to help us. I let him know we stopped in to say hello to Jared and asked if he was around. Turns out the young fella was Jared. !!! I introduced myself as PjShorthorn from WC and he chuckled. I'm not sure if that was a compliment ...LOL. Breezy and I had a nice chat with Jared and at one point he excused himself for a moment for what I thought to be where he needed to help a customer in camp. It turns out he went and got a map so that he could mark up fishing spots in the area for us to consider. What a nice gesture and great customer service even though we weren't staying with his lodge. Jared, thank you for your thoughtfulness. It was very apparent that a lot of work has gone into the camp with new docks, cabin upgrades and some very nice looking facilities. I would absolutely consider this lodge for future trips.We caught some nice fish the remainder of Tuesday and Wednesday close to camp and mostly in smaller bays where the wind was blowing into them The water temps held steady at 66 degrees with a slight dip to 64 on our last day. All of our fish were caught in 6-7 fow pulling Hot-n-Tots. The fish remained oriented to shallow structure and weeds. On the last pass of the trip around an island, I was fortunate enough to land a very nice 38"" northern which was a classic way to end a very enjoyable trip to a new lake with a good friend.I do think that Breezy won the contest for parking his boat on reefs. I may have come in a close second .......All things considered, I couldn't have asked for a better experience. I'll have LOTW on my list for future trips.I'll post some pictures separately.PjShorthorn."
4969217,pjshorthorn,2016-07-05 19:30:00,5654,"We have been having ""12 step"" conversations about downsizing his trip gear....including his personal coffee pot. He keeps thinking that the white lines on the coffee pot in the cabin are measured in liters and therefore the coffee tastes like moose piss. I'm trying...... PjShorthorn"
4969473,rnnonmt,2016-07-05 20:52:00,992,"Pat - that 3 FOOT HOLE in the houseboat was strategically placed to minimize the cost on repairs to the outfitter based on prevailing winds, extreme low water conditions, and torrential down pour but mostly on the fact that our guide was too chicken $hit to come and dock it for us. I was trying to make sure the group and I made our connecting flight back to Chi-town."
4962481,pjshorthorn,2016-07-02 04:49:00,5654,You'll have a great time. Breezy mentioned that fall fishing for crappie and walleye can be outstanding. I'm pretty sure I know which cabin you are staying at.PjShorthorn.
4965905,rnnonmt,2016-07-04 07:18:00,992,Thanks for posting your report Pat. I'm always interested in reading them. I can picture your trip happening in my mind from the detail you share depicting the outdoor ambiance with such comical satire. Glad you had a good trip! Thanks for sharing with the less fortunate (me)!
4966105,jimirjr,2016-07-04 10:03:00,1149,"I'll second that ^^^^ AND Brian... Watched Your ""YOU TUBE"" video from last year AGAIN this morn.... If ""that"" makes You feel any better !!"
4966193,pjshorthorn,2016-07-04 10:30:00,5654,Get ready. Second trip is starting in 3 weeks My son and I are planning to portage through three lakes to get back to a remote lake. There is no telling how many stories will come out of that expedition alone PjShorthorn
4966273,rnnonmt,2016-07-04 11:32:00,992,Thanks Jimi! I think youtube removed the music from one of the videos ..... and Pat - Enjoy the next go-round of fishing. I'll be looking forward to the report! Heading outside to get the smoker going! Baby back ribs are on the menu. 6 hours of smoke!! Yum!!! Have a safe 4th guys.
4968577,Guest,2016-07-05 14:30:00,0,"Hey PJ, will you be heading up to the Sabaskong area again? Really enjoyed the summary of your last trip, hope to get the same after your next trip too! Good luck!"
4968633,pjshorthorn,2016-07-05 14:51:00,5654,Well I sure hope I can make another 50 trips to the LOTW lake system.......as long as Breezy Point will allow me to join him and park his boat on a couple of nice reefs ........on occasion Our next trip to Eagle Lake at Vermilion Bay Lodge will be a week long adventure full of fun stuff to report on. Thanks for your reply. PjShorthorn.
4968993,rnnonmt,2016-07-05 17:51:00,992,"Pat - I know you are an educated guy and all that but I just wanted make sure that you are aware that ""portaging"" usually requires you to get out of one boat and into another one on the other side of terra firma - Not jumping it...... Just incase you had any doubt. ok?"
4969129,pjshorthorn,2016-07-05 19:09:00,5654,"Brian, I say Vroom Vroom !!!!! Light em up and let's go creek dredging !!!! Gord has been adding new upgrade boats over the past few years and I bet he wouldn't miss a second 50 hp Yammie motor for one day. Twin 50s will blow us right through from Vermillion Bay into Clearwater Lake and beyond. The Rags on Lac Seul don't have squat on this trip. I did receive a suggestion from V -Bay Gord that I bring some boots. His suggestion seems to me that he may have a few concerns about my boating abilities. I only tore off a transducer last year....it isn't like a tore a 3 ft hole in the side of a houseboat when docking it. BTW, thanks for the foreign language lesson on ""dirt""..... I had to look it up. It would have been a little awkward to ask my wife what it meant PjShorthorn."
4969137,BreezyPoint,2016-07-05 19:10:00,1581,No room for boots in my truck. Have to save space for all of Gramps stuff.Frank
4959985,pjshorthorn,2016-06-30 22:56:00,5654,One more
4960049,wallydave,2016-07-01 04:50:00,2151,"Pat, I know Frank can park a boat,! On Red Lake he showed me how it's done! I could tell he had done that before , he had me move to the transom so the waves could push us clear!"
4960081,pjshorthorn,2016-07-01 05:15:00,5654,"Hmmmmm. Now isn't that just a little historical nugget that has never been mentioned by Breezy. Now he has beaver dam dredging and reef parking on his resume. If he adds stump sitt'in and and sand bar beaching when we are at V-Bay's place, I might be driving the boat 100% of the time. PjShorthorn."
4960233,Bill Krejca,2016-07-01 06:50:00,6107,"Good report, Pat, glad you had a good time, nice fish. Jared is a class guy. Thanks again for Dad's sign. Bill"
4960305,BreezyPoint,2016-07-01 07:09:00,1581,"Ok, I admit the truth. It was really me, not Pat, who parked the boat on a reef.Frank"
4961129,Obabikon,2016-07-01 11:36:00,2370,"Next time, we can try to plan out a shore lunch. Just bring the fish up!We'll see if you like our personal breading."
4961537,pjshorthorn,2016-07-01 15:08:00,5654,Now that is a deal !! Best wishes on the rest of the season. PjShortlhorn.
4961913,wallydave,2016-07-01 17:18:00,2151,Frank the truth will set you free! Glad you and Pat had a good trip!
4961945,johnboat,2016-07-01 17:34:00,2014,"Sounds like a good trip. I will be there in Sept at a private cabin. You were VERY close to it. Continue down the gravel ""road"" just past Red Wing. 1st place on the right. I hope you left me a 30 incher or two!"
4962401,Rich B,2016-07-01 22:06:00,1081,"Excellent report and thanks for sharing.....sounds like a great trip to the camp, and a fun time on the water....especially meeting Jarid and checking out his camp.... Rich B"
4958505,BreezyPoint,2016-06-30 10:11:00,1581,I should note that it was my boat PJ parked on the reef. Said he wanted to anchor us because I didn't have an anchor. I should say it was a pleasure to have PJ drive the boat...this was my very first trip since the 1960s when I didn't drive the boat the entire time!Frank
4958713,prov1800,2016-06-30 10:50:00,5010,Sounds like a great trip
4959225,jimirjr,2016-06-30 15:00:00,1149,"Sounds like a FUN time, PAT and BREEZY !! LOW is truly an IMMENSE system... Full of surprises... and obstacles.. and ROCK REEFS... Gonna get back real soon !"
4959361,pjshorthorn,2016-06-30 15:57:00,5654,I can live with that version of the story PjShorthorn.
4959377,pjshorthorn,2016-06-30 16:08:00,5654,Here are a few pics from the trip.
4959441,emma17,2016-06-30 16:57:00,436,Thanks for taking the time to share your adventure to LOW. Both of you give fisherman a good name.
4959633,Obabikon,2016-06-30 18:40:00,2370,"It was a pleasure meeting you guys! I'm glad you had a good trip, and sorry I had to cut the chat short to cook a shore lunch. However... it was delicious."
4959929,pjshorthorn,2016-06-30 22:13:00,5654,"Yeah, we could smell the shore lunch when we left your place We ate wet bologna sandwiches. on the way back to Redwing. ........ PjShorthorn."
