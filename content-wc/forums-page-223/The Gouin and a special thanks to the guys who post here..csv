Although this is my first post, I have been following the threads for a few years now and this message board is a tremendous source of information. I spend at least one week a year on the Gouin Reservoir (16 years and counting). I fish the NW side of the Gouin through Caesars North Camps. I'm no expert, but will do my best to help anyone looking for information on this great fishery. That being said.....my trip is scheduled for July 20th this year. A little later then I would like, but from what I'm hearing it's turning out to be a good thing. I heard the weather this spring was a little late and fishing has been a little tough. I'm hoping the weather/fishing is starting to stabilize. Has anyone been up there recently? I heard the water was high this year, but that report was from May. I'm really curious to know the water level and any reports you might like to share. Thanks again!"
