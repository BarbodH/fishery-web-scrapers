4979697,396ranger,2016-07-10 19:37:00,105,Just got back from a trip to Eagle lake and it would be nice to have a map chip that is more accurate than what my premium and platinum navionics chip has. The hot spot paper map is good but that only gets you so close and not all the reefs are marked or all the hazards. I've noticed the depths are off also one spot said on the map chip 20ft deep and the depth finder has 65ft.
