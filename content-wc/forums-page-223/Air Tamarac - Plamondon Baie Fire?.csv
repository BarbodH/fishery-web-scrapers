4972609,a3dad,2016-07-07 14:22:00,115,I just saw the Air Tamarac's Facebook post from June 27th regarding the fires near their cabins 40/41 in Plamondon Baie. Does anyone know the extent of the fire or if any of their property were damaged? Looks pretty scary.https://www.facebook.com/Air-Tamarac-1545781175664572/

4973609,Matrix04,2016-07-07 19:31:00,13,We arrived at Plamondon on the 27th. We were not aware of the fire until we saw the SOPFEU helicopter the same day. At that point the fire had been extinguished. The fire was on an island about 1 mile from the camps. From what we could see (burned trees) from the water it was limited to a small area.
