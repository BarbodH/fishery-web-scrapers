4974641,rwl,2016-07-08 09:20:00,1655,"Just wondering where you would stop for a case of beer between the border and Morson? What would you expect to pay. The little general store that has been being built for a year or so, are they open and do they have it?"
4974673,Obabikon,2016-07-08 09:45:00,2370,"You need to stop in Rainy River. Just past the border (maybe 1/2 mile) on hwy 11 there's an LCBO. Should cost around $33 canadian per case. The store in Morson is open, but does not sell beer."
4974689,rwl,2016-07-08 09:49:00,1655,"Thank you, I've seen the LCBO there every trip twice a year but never stopped or knew if it was the only place. Don't drink beer myself. I'll be passing through tomorrow on the way to Gills to launch. How is the little store doing?"
4975033,Carnhzkr,2016-07-08 11:49:00,964,Anybody know if there's a Duty Free store crossing from Baudette into RR?

I'm not sure what the cost differential would have been buying there vs the LCBO in Rainy River. I picked up my ""extra"" beer in Rainy River. There is also a nice grocery store in Rainy River on the right hand side before the LCBO. Got some Tenderflake lard there so my wife could make pie crusts. So far one apple pie has been made since my return üëç. PjShorthorn."
