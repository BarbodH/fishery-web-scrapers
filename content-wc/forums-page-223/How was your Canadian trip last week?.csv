4971793,David Anderson,2016-07-07 08:30:00,2073,"Fished Lac Seul, Chamberlain narrows from June 29 - July 1. Plenty of fish to eat, Wednesday was slow but got chased off by storms 3 times. Thursday was good and Friday was phenomenal. I have a counter in the boat as a 100 fish day is tough even though people claim it all the time, in an 8 hour day that's one fish every 5 minutes, all the time. We got 103 walleyes on Friday including a 30 incher. My take was it turned out to be pretty normal."
4972713,Bill Krejca,2016-07-07 14:53:00,6107,"Young's runs a good camp. Next time you go, fish the narrows 1/2 block from camp. Especially if windy. Bill"
4968457,UKBDM,2016-07-05 13:57:00,178,"We were on Wabaskang last week and the walleye bite was slower than normal. We didn't starve but we didn't have any 50-75 fish days like we normally do. Had some 10-20 fish days. I think there were a couple factors in play ... mayflies were thick across much of the lake and the fish were deeper than we usually find them this time of year. We were slow to adapt to deeper fish and frankly have little experience fishing doing so. We did catch some bigger walleye (22-25"") right before dark in deep water trolling stickbaits Good news though ... smallmouth fishing was unbelievable. Our group of 8 caught 16 of them 17-18.5"" long and didn't spend a lot of time doing it."
4968817,SinOrSwim,2016-07-05 16:01:00,1528,"we were on LOTW, Stevens Bay last week. got back the 29th. Only a 3 day trip and we did not catch very many fish. However, there were several factors. I didn't realize the area close to camp was more suited to northern and musky fishing. Fishign shallow and in weeds is not something I have a great deal experience with. In addition, I had two kids with me so I didn't personally fish much. Hindsight it wasn't a good idea to take a 7yo along from a fishing standpoint. I was trying to balance his dislike of being in the boat with my 11yo want to fish. Still had a great trip though. Even though the 7yo had no interest being in the boat for extended periods of time it was still a ton of fun. Oh and the weather was all over the place. 85 and humid on arrival. Down pouring rains. Next day mid 60's and blowing 20 to 30 with gusts higher. Enjoyed youngs camp a lot. The people, facilities, food etc. was easy to get to the launch to take the kids into town and grab ice cream and a round of mini golf mid-day. I just need to learn how to fish like that better."
4968921,prov1800,2016-07-05 16:55:00,5010,I know a guy.
4969113,rnnonmt,2016-07-05 19:00:00,992,I could consider myself as a really crappy fisherman at times but I think I could be blamed for fowl hooking at least 7 walleye in a trip. Sorry you had such a poor fishing trip. Why the big deal of not saying what lake you were on? I don't care about the knowing the outpost you stayed at because the outpost isn't responsible for guaranteeing how many fish you catch.
4969977,SinOrSwim,2016-07-06 07:36:00,1528,we will be discussing in September. LOL
4970097,jb_wi,2016-07-06 08:35:00,212,"I knew this lake wasn't a big numbers lake as far as walleyes go, but I was hoping for a little better then a group count of 7. The conditions were...deep water lake, solid layer of may flies covering the entire lake, water temp around 66 degrees average. The walleyes we did catch were closer to larger bays of shallower water..and by that I mean average of 28 feet in the bay. Found the 2 bigger fish on a 13 foot rock point off of a weedy bay. The fish were in a transition phase and were not at all yet schooled by any normal structure. Also the water is crystal clear and almost every day was low wind and bright sun. The fact that I didn't know the lake at all, combined with mayflies and the fact that water temp was behind for this time of year all contributed to a bad week of fishing in my opinion . Host was a great guy, and believe it or not, this is a lake I may try in the fall when the fish are in a late summer or fall pattern. I think there really is a chance at a true trophy in this lake. Not going to name the lake because I don't want my lack of knowledge of the lake or my lack of research to affect the business for the camp. Thanks for all of the replies."
4970945,Gouin3,2016-07-06 18:28:00,5,"JB, Hang in there. A bad week of fishing just helps you appreciate the next good week that much more! It may have been bad timing. I have been fishing the same camp for the last 12 years. I have had 500 fish weeks and 50 fish weeks. Sometimes Mother Nature doesn't cooperate. No doubt that lake holds a trophy. Just need the elements to line up. Good luck!"
4971633,SinOrSwim,2016-07-07 07:21:00,1528,"I should add we went to sioux narrows so the boys could minigolf and get ice cream. I stopped at 2 bait shops in town to grab some leeches and asked both what the walleye were biting. Both people.............sort of crinkled their nose and said..........aaaaahhhhhhhh..........weeelllllll.. .........leeches, worms and crawlers but the walleye bite is really tough right now. Both said they were being caught in about 11 to 20 feet and it was a very very light bite. Said the weather and the wind had pretty much scattered them. It can be very disappointing to go up and not do well. MAny of us look forward to these trips all year. Doesn't mean we all fish a lot. I'm not a very experienced fisherman even though I've been going up for such a long time. So, if the basics don't work, my abilities aren't necessarily good enough to really search and figure out the patterns in such a short period of time."
4971689,prov1800,2016-07-07 07:40:00,5010,A true conservationist would not fish that deep.doesnt matter which camp/guide you have.totally unexceptable.those fish you release are turtle bait.any guide/fisherman that fishes that deep needs to to think aboutvwhat there doing.i guided at northshore lodge last week on saw all the boats there on my way to shallower spots.
4971697,worthsr,2016-07-07 07:41:00,52,"We spent last week on Lac Seul. The weather was all over the place and fishing was tough. Our slowest production in the last ten or twenty years. Six guys in three boats caught 500 walleye in 5.5 days. Largest eye was 28 and the largest pike was 40, both fish were thick. A tough week on Lac Seul is a dream week for lots of walleye fishermen."
4967033,LoDo,2016-07-04 21:48:00,721,"You have to fish on the bottom when using a jig and minnow. Half kidding. I have zero idea how you only caught 7 fish. That is borderline unbelievable. I'm 37, fished NW Ontario for 25 years and never have I only had 7 fish in the boat the whole trip."
4967185,Stringbean,2016-07-05 05:01:00,279,"A group of 5 of us fished in Ontario last week. The only slow day was Sunday after that cold front went through. We may have to brush up on tactics to use after a front goes through. The rest of the week was above average for us. The eater size walleyes were at 19 feet on top of underwater humps and the bigger fish were down on the sides around 22-23 feet. I started the week using spinning rigs which worked very well, but by Tuesday I switched over to a jig and minnow and did better. I don't need a fish fry for the next 6 months."
4967217,fishron,2016-07-05 05:45:00,317,"Our group fished much further east, in Quebec last week, and the bite was really on. As usual, we compare notes with other groups coming off the lake and read the log at the cabin we stay at. Without a doubt the early fishing in that area had been a challenge. Temperatures in the twenties and snow had occurred. The group the week before that we met as we took over the cabin had good fishing but in much shallower water nearer to the walleye spawning areas. With warmer weather toward our week the fish really hit some of our familiar spots. Folks coming off the Goin reservoir complained about the slow fishing there. No doubt it was a late season due to colder than normal temperatures. We caught walleye shallow throwing for pike and deep to 30 ft, indicating the warmer weather prior to out trip had spread the fish. We fish a jig and a worm. Need nothing else. Sorry for your slow week. I've got to believe it's not typical."
4967233,Skywagon,2016-07-05 05:51:00,1106,"My Spidy sense tells me that the guy that caught the 31"" wears a funny looking white hat and grey sweatshirt when he fishes (or at least hangs around such a person), obviously the secret combination. I am out the door to do some clothes shopping."
4967345,deadhead1,2016-07-05 06:36:00,193,Generally I would say LOW is slower for walleye than most years and I find we had to move around more than normal. North east part of lake such as Big Stone bay is dead right now. I actually don't mind when fishing is a little tough because then it forces you to move around and you see more of the lake. When fishing is good we tend to go back to same place every time.
4967889,Guest,2016-07-05 10:23:00,0,"You nailed him to a tee. He had both big Walleyes 31. 1/4"" & 28. 3/4"" And to the other gentleman that described The guide as Enrique. You nailed it. What a hoot!!! Learned so much with him that day. And to the other poster who complained about fishing deep Walleyes your complaint is not respectful as there were several different resorts fishing the deep humps that morning all over the Eastern Basin. I counted 15 that I could see about 8:00am. Only two from TB."
4968017,SterlingArcher,2016-07-05 11:12:00,92,"We had a group of 10 on Lake Savant (a ways NE of Lac Seul) from June 25-June 30. The fish were in some unusual spots for this time of year - a few of our regular spots were either empty or held only a few fish - but with a bit of hunting we found both outstanding numbers and size.100 fish days would have been a piece of cake if that had been the goal, but me and the guy I fished with for much of the trip decided to do more pike fishing, so we caught 60-70 fish most days. Best depths for us were 13-18 feet, and we caught quite a few fish from 20-25 FOW. The shallower spots that are usually lights-out when we go (and we always go at this time of year) were no good at all, except for one that held massive quantities of smaller (11-15"") walleyes and lots of pike.It was also a less aggressive bite than we are used to...a lot of times you would lift the rod tip to jig, and feel weight and that was it. There were some that hammered the jig of course, but most bit much lighter. We caught equal numbers drifting and dragging jigs as we did casting. Didn't seem to matter much. Glow-white and pink were the best colors. Minnows outproduced twister tails by at least 30 to 1...probably closer to 50 to 1.I should note that weed growth seems WAYYYY behind normal. A couple of places that usually have great stands of deep cabbage, and reliably kick out good pike and walleyes, had either no cabbage or it was way behind pace. Not sure if this is due to spring weather, water levels, or something else, but it definitely made us fish in some different spots."
4968073,jb_wi,2016-07-05 11:38:00,212,The two walleyes I did catch were nice - one 24 3/4 and the other 25..(slow trolling a spinner in 13' of water). I'll chalk this one up to a bad experience and head somewhere else for the next trip.
4968137,stumcfar,2016-07-05 12:07:00,451,I have to believe the lake you were fishing can not be a very good walleye lake any time. Those are not Ontario walleye lake numbers even on the worst of times. I think I would be looking for other options.
4968313,SterlingArcher,2016-07-05 13:05:00,92,"Head to Cliff and Roma's on Lake Savant. The fishing is unbelievable, and the hosts are terrific."
4966625,jb_wi,2016-07-04 16:50:00,212,"Went to Ontario last week and basically got skunked. Was told from the resort owner that the fish weren't even biting on Lac Seul? I find this hard to believe but I've seen stranger things I guess. We caught 7 walleye between 11 people, and we're not newbs at walleye fishing. How was your trip last week? June 26 - July 3rd or so? -JB"
4966657,Skywagon,2016-07-04 17:40:00,1106,"So we all gotta know, what lake where you fishing on? that may explain part of it. How did others do in your camp? were the camp owners any help, have suggestions of locations, depths, bait? Fishing has been a little more challenging at times, more so than most years at the end of June. On the walleye lakes I have been on this season, the fish seem shallower than I would expect for the date. The mayfly hatch seems to have run it course over the last two weeks, you would have been here for that, but that should not have been the end of the world. Seven fish for eleven people is unacceptable, time to find a new lake and camp, there are plenty of good lakes and great camps, no need to settle for less."
4966681,Guest,2016-07-04 17:50:00,0,"I don't want to make you feel bad but but you asked and we were right near Lac Seul on Eagle Lake so here is what we did. We had an above average year. We could have had 100 fish days but after catching shore lunch we were trophy hunting for big walleyes so we left areas where we found lots of small ones. Catch a few and move, catch a few and move. Never stayed very long unless there were big fish around. Hit one hump 3 times in one day because we would get fish in the slot, over the slot of 23"" and bigger and then it would shut down. We would come back catch big ones and release some more. Had a very busy day on Friday. Here is the message I posted on another website with my additional comments below. Just got back today from 4 day fishing trip by Wisconsin bus to Temple Bay Lodge on Eagle. Fished Walleyes only. Jig and minnow only. 3 persons in our boat for the 4 days, boated a 31"" 1/4"", 28"" 3/4"",26"",25"" numerous 20's to 23"". 50 - 60 fish everyday except Thursday when big storm hit with lightning and rains. Still caught fish but had less time on water due to dangerous conditions. Lost two super size Walleyes one maybe bigger than the 31"" fish we boated. Jig color didn't matter. Northerns caught while jig fishing, largest 30"". Also I will add this. Fished last day with a guide all other days were on our own. Some people new to lake didn't do very good. Those that have been going for many years had no problems. We fished with 9 other guys (4boats total) and I would make a guess that all the boats together might have caught 1000 fish total. The last night one boat went perch fishing and caught 32 jumbo perch and a 30"" northern that was released. They also were catching slot walleyes while perch fishing in the cabbage weeds. BIG Walleyes were deep. We caught them from 27 feet to 35 feet on humps. The guide we had fishes Lac Seul but is helping out at TBL because of the death of their senior guide who left a big slot to fill. Our guide's opinion on what lake has the better chance for a 30"" fish is Eagle. Some guys on the bus trip like to target Jumbo Perch and they took home 167 Perch among 4 guys. ( 50 Perch Limit per person) All areas produced fish. Bays and weeds and deep humps Check out TBL I have been there 12 years and some of the guys I go with have 24 years there. We do use our past experience to find fish and we do use our GPS to find those spots that have worked in the past. In the package deal we get a free one day guide and usually the new folks on the bus do a guide the first day so they can gain a little experience. The mayflies were hatching like crazy while we were there and didn't affect our fishing. Any help I can give let me know. Sorry you didn't do better. Good Luck in the future."
4966737,jb_wi,2016-07-04 18:09:00,212,"We were staying at an outpost so no others there, but from what I heard I think we did as good or better than the guys at the main camp..which is pretty sad. Not going to name the lake or camps until I hear more from other posters."
4966753,jb_wi,2016-07-04 18:19:00,212,We were not too far up the road from Eagle..we drove right past it
4966873,Ver88,2016-07-04 19:36:00,114,"My group had our slowest fishing trip ever to lake of the woods. Still caught fish, but not like we usually do."
4966905,Obabikon,2016-07-04 19:59:00,2370,"Lake of the Woods has been decent. The majority of fish have been coming out of 24-30 feet of water in MUD flats. If you didn't find that pattern... it was going to be extremely difficult. I guided a 30"" fish last week, and I didn't have a single day that we didn't have lunch by 9:30."

4966961,Lmbkiller,2016-07-04 21:00:00,639,"I'll be the guy that says u gentleman should drink less. 7 fish for 11 guys is ridiculous. I don't know how good u guys are at fishing and really, it doesn't matter. 11 blind guys could catch 7 fish in a mud puddle. I'm not ribbing u guys either as I've had plenty of tough times, but that isn't right. I'm baffled to be honest"
4966977,Pooch,2016-07-04 21:21:00,4619,"Guides name wasn't Enrique, was it? If so, he is a hoot. Know him and have fished with him and his friends from Dryden. Usually keeps us entertained most of the day.Pooch"
