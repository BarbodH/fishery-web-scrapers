I'm looking for a lake thats primarily used for fishing, however a little recreation is fine. I prefer a lake where one can drive a boat to town, public doc, grab dinner/drinks/coffee/grocery/shopping/etc.... 1/4 acre+ would be ideal. A nearby golf course is a huge bonus!! I know Leech Lake pretty well and Walker is a great town that offers everything i noted above. Looking for those that have experience with LOTW and Vermillion. Regards,"

4978161,Northwoodswalleye,2016-07-10 08:31:00,262,Vermilion. Not sure where you will be driving from but it's probably 3 hours closer to the twin cities that LOTW. Fortune Bay has a very nice golf course and there is another on the cook end. Decent fishing and easily navigated in most all winds. That's just my opinion and I live on vermilion and have fished it all of my life so maybe I'm a little biased!
4978753,LoDo,2016-07-10 12:15:00,721,"Vermillon is huge! Do you prefer the east of west side of the lake? Which side is more populous? Which side is more attractive for recreation, skiing, etc...."
4979113,Northwoodswalleye,2016-07-10 14:53:00,262,I live on the west end and typically there is less boat traffic here. About 30 miles to tower but very well marked as far as rocks etc. either end is fine for recreation. Golf course on each end and quite a few restaurant/bars to choose from scattered on the whole lake. If you snowmobile at all it is a great place to ride from.
