Is Archie's Landing still operating? If it is still operating, what are the protocols for putting in there and leaving your vehicle parked there? I have some friends going to Lac Seul in a couple of weeks and they were interested in using the ramp if possible. Thanks for any information available!!!"

4925201,CycloneWalleyeHunter,2016-06-14 01:35:00,18,"Pooch, Thanks for the information. I am still hopeful of getting some more informative regarding the landing. I you hear any more or know someone who would know, it will be greatly appreciated. A cold beer and walleye sandwich perhaps. Thanks again,Scott"
