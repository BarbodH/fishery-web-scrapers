4944241,Dakota Floyd,2016-06-22 14:51:00,62,WE stayed there last summer with the kids. Our first trip this year we stayed at Deer Path. This August we will be staying at Mahkwa. How for up did you travel? Thanks
4969553,ScottL,2016-07-05 21:36:00,733,Bumping this to the top hoping for a recent update. We are heading up there on the 14th and are hoping that the Rags is good to go for the houseboat.
4969849,cuamb,2016-07-06 06:44:00,203,We took a 68 ft Houseboat through the rags on June 11th and 17th. We could not take the short cut closer to lost lake. I will be headed back up on the 15th of July and hopefully we can take that shortcut also.
4925769,tv4fish,2016-06-14 07:29:00,2694,SOOOO - Sky - How low is the water at the Deception launch now (when you were up there) ???
4927849,Skywagon,2016-06-14 19:16:00,1106,"No problems at the deception launch. Water is definitely lower, with more concrete pad out of the water than usual, but still plenty of usable dock. This is only a wild guess, but it looks like the lake may be down 1 1/2 to 2 feet from what I usually see through the year. I did notice after going through Manitou rapids heading west, the marker buoy that is on the right side had a lot of rock sticking out of the water by it, not normal to see that. No worries, everything will be fine. We are going to spend a day with Pooch on the other end of the lake (west side) Friday, I am hoping he has all the new rocks on that side marked for us by then."
4928465,Pooch,2016-06-15 05:25:00,4619,"Just slow Henry down a little! Lots of freshly damaged props setting on the work bench of the camp owner here. I've been just driving slower and really, really paying attention. Amazed at all the hazards we have been driving over for the past few years that I can now see sicking out just above the current water line. Oh my...Pooch"
4928777,tv4fish,2016-06-15 07:28:00,2694,Thank you Sky - that info is appreciated. Looks like our first trip up to our favorite spots may be a LOOONGER one this year. C'mon rain......
4928833,eyedrvm,2016-06-15 07:40:00,48,Just got back from lost island lodge. Fished last week. Shane said the water level was close to normal for this time of year. Maybe just 1-1 1/2 feet low. He said not to go through the rags just play it safe n go around. It was our first time on lac suel so that may ave had something to do with it. 2 of the 4 boats in our group hit the same rock in a shallow area before canoe bay. Boat one made it through boat 2 hit I made it through and boat 4 hit. I must have made it by a wisker. @ dinged props and bent shafts!!
4928849,eyedrvm,2016-06-15 07:42:00,48,PS. Fish were mostly scattered. 2-4 fish per spot 6-20 feet of water. Fishing was just fair I would say that week. Have no doubt that depending on the spot and day you could have a better outing. Huge lake to learn!!
4930409,Dakota Floyd,2016-06-15 15:27:00,62,Eye You need to stay close to the shore on the last point which you found out the hard way. If you are following the track on your GPS it will take you right into the rocks. Glad no one was hurt. Were you fishing Canoe? We had excellent fishing in that area
4942473,bigwalleye1,2016-06-21 18:58:00,2632,"Just returned tonight from Lac Suel. I estimate the water at Deception landing to be AT LEAST two feet low from last year, based on the position of the floating dock, the number of concrete ramp pieces out of the water, the rock island on the right headed to Deception light. Saw a couple boats coming down the lake through the rags, but a LOT more coming from Devils Elbow. Fish very scattered, with the storms and weather. We worked hard to put a pattern together but it was about the toughest I've experienced in June in years."
4942561,Pooch,2016-06-21 19:54:00,4619,"Exactly our experience last week on LS. When they were ""on"" they were very ""on"". When they were not, they really had lock jaw. Walleye marked at all depths to thirty feet, but most caught in six to twelve feet.Fixed docks could not be used in camp because of low water. Third year in this camp and by far the lowest water I've seen at this time of year.Not to hijack this thread. Just my observation agreeing with others reports.Pooch"
4943049,Dakota Floyd,2016-06-22 06:17:00,62,Pooch What camp were you at?
4903817,cuamb,2016-06-06 08:51:00,203,Thanks for the update!
4912841,bigwalleye1,2016-06-09 07:12:00,2632,"http://www.lwcb.ca/noticeboard.html Latest notice board announcement today: 1166.7 ft elevation. By my recollection, maps are produced for LS based on an 1167 ft elevation base. By the numbers, we should be getting close to normal depth for launching and for the Rags, but I have found that www.lwcb.ca notice board readings and actual observances at Deception Bay landing and the Rags are often somewhat different. Anyone have up to date info??"
4914993,David Anderson,2016-06-09 22:28:00,2073,"Just an FYI, went through there on May 23rd, Ranger 620 with 250 HO, idled through and didn't kick up any mud. On the return trip blew through on plane with zero issues."
4916377,rnnonmt,2016-06-10 14:24:00,992,"Been through the rags many times in the houseboat. If I can recall correctly the lowest elevation that we have ever passed through there in a HB was at 1168-69 ft recorded on GPS. (yes, the GPS antenna was corrected for height above the water) It has been about 5 years since the last HB trip so my memory might be a bit dusty. Anyone ever put the flag marker back on that stump in the middle of that channel??"
4917385,Skywagon,2016-06-11 05:24:00,1106,"Without an RTK correctional signal, GPS elevation data is nowhere near accurate (I mean way off). If the weather is fit, I plan on traveling through there tomorrow, I'll let you know if any stranded house boats are blocking the path."
4917593,pjshorthorn,2016-06-11 07:46:00,5654,"Brian, With all your minor ""HB"" incidents, I figured one of them would have been taking that stump out with the Mercruiser I/O.......ðŸ˜± PjShorthorn."
4921809,rnnonmt,2016-06-13 05:44:00,992,"LOL - Pat. Just to be clear all of my HB incidents were ""major."" Please don't try and take any of the glory away from my piloting skills."
4923025,tv4fish,2016-06-13 11:10:00,2694,"You, Sir - are entirely correct. Especially when you are dealing with a ""handheld"" or boat mounted receiver. The elevation component of GPS is the LEAST accurate. Even with ""survey grade"" GPS (where we can measure horizontal distances to +/- 0.10 of a foot easily - our elevation data is not nearly that accurate and therefore, NOT very reliable.."
4924321,rnnonmt,2016-06-13 17:22:00,992,Thanks for the input guys on the error of GPS elevation. LOL - it is good enough to keep me from busting class B airspace..... thought it would be good enough on the water.
4925313,Skywagon,2016-06-14 05:25:00,1106,"Despite the fact that the GPS units we use for instrument flight are outrageously expensive, WAAS is still not accurate enough to measure within a few feet of elevation (but plenty good enough for vertical separation in air space). I have never had my Garmin 430 WAAS unit in the boat, I am sure it would do a fine job in the holding pattern waiting in line to get loaded at the boat launch at Deception Bay, but would not put any faith in it to keep me out of the rocks. I ended up going through the rags yesterday, according to my Lowrance HDS sonar units (not certified for instrument flight) the depth ran in the 4-5 foot range. Fishing was OK, but not spectacular, had to work for what we got. The fish seemed to be in the 10-17' range. With the weather finally starting to warm up, I would guess we will find them deeper before long."
4866169,Ranger319,2016-05-24 07:17:00,166,"With all of the talk about water being down a little, has anyone been through the Rags yet? WOndering if it will be a blow thru or an idle thru when we are up there in a few weeks."
4867137,bigwalleye1,2016-05-24 11:38:00,2632,"With all due respect, the tale of the tape will be in a couple weeks. It's all about the precip and runoff. A check on www.lwcb.ca, and click on the ""Notice Board"" will be of some assistance, but a check several days prior to your departure will yield more accurate results. Given recent posts of photos og the Deception Bay landing, at this point, I think you may be going around Devils Elbow if somebody doesn't start doing a rain dance."
4875257,Ranger319,2016-05-27 08:09:00,166,Anyone been through or by this area yet?
4875777,Dakota Floyd,2016-05-27 10:18:00,62,We will be heading up next Wednesday. I can let you know if we take that way. Looking at the levels I think you should be able to motor right thru them
4876937,SeulAreaWalleye,2016-05-28 04:26:00,100,"There is 2 ft of water in there, most people are trimming up and going slow through the rags, I however trim it high and run it like a hovercraft full throttle(I know where the stumps are though)"
4878969,ScottL,2016-05-29 10:52:00,733,So are the houseboats able to go thru there with only 2 feet of water or are they going around Devil's Elbow?
4880313,SeulAreaWalleye,2016-05-30 04:40:00,100,"Houseboats are going the long way, no short cut or rags for them yet....too risky. Water is rising daily with rainfall on Lac Seul though. That being said - watch for floaters."
4886265,Skywagon,2016-05-31 17:07:00,1106,"Be careful with that new boat Colin, saw a picture of it, what a beauty."
4903393,cuamb,2016-06-06 06:47:00,203,Any updates from this weekend? Will be taking houseboat up on Saturday the 10th.
4903457,Dakota Floyd,2016-06-06 07:06:00,62,House boats from what I saw are running through Devils Elbow. Also no shortcut for the houseboats. There is enough water though for small boats at both locations. Excellent fishing. 8' to 12' is where we found them
