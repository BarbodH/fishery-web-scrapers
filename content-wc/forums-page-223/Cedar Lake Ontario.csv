4962585,prov1800,2016-07-02 05:58:00,5010,Besides catching a few bigger fish throughout the day why do you think its LS is better.give me some pros and cons of each lake.id really be interested.
4966321,CatchemwhileUcan,2016-07-04 12:12:00,4,I haven't' seen anybody post any pictures of recently caught large walleye.
4968857,SinOrSwim,2016-07-05 16:11:00,1528,"if you don't want to go, don't. Or, just go and find out? They do a nice job with their facebook. Check that out. Plus, those reports all have pictures. But, you make it seem like we need to prove it to you? All these places are a risk when it comes to how the fishign will be."
4969337,Terwalleye,2016-07-05 20:14:00,166,"Catchem In our boat this past Mid June we boated several fish over 26 inches. Yes, only several. My personal best prior to this year was a 28 and I got 3 that size or bigger this year. But then we were not there for opener and the surface temp was hitting 70 by the time we left. Those big fish will go deep and lay low based on our lack of success finding them daily. But ""dinks?"" If consider cookie cutter 15 inchers dinks; then yes they are everywhere. Next year will be year 8 for us and we cannot wait to go back. Not to mention the musky the smallmouth the crappie yada yada yada"
4958881,CatchemwhileUcan,2016-06-30 11:49:00,4,"I've been fishing in Canada for 40 years mostly Fly-ins, several weeks a year. I've been recently invited to spend six days on Cedarlake off of Highway 105. From my research and what I'm seeing from other fishing media is that this lake is really struggling to produce walleyes. Can anybody enhance or amplify about this question I have. My friends are hoping to have a very successful walleye bite but I am leery about what I've been hearing. Such as the water quality has gone down, hard to find Walleyes and when you do they are mostly dings 10""-12"". The good northern fishing is almost non-existence, and the bass has taken over the lake. On a positive note I hear a couple good things about muskies there but it sounds like same type of Muskie fishing I find a northern Wisconsin. I don't want my friend to be disappointed and waste a bunch of money. Open to up to date information from fisherman not resort owners."
4958905,prov1800,2016-06-30 12:03:00,5010,"You must becreading information about another cedar lake.the lake i fish is totally the opposite of what your hearing.not sure what the muskie fishing is like in wisc.can only go by what i hear, small fish, to many people.youll see other boats but size wise on cedar its up there with some of the top lakes."
4959273,CatchemwhileUcan,2016-06-30 15:13:00,4,"Hey Prov1800I am curious when was the last time you fished cedar lake? I haven't heard of any great bites on the social chatter box. Only a few, but the were not consistence. My friend and the rest of the group are serious walleye fisherman. But we also like to get away for a few days not to work realllllly hard. We understand all the compeonents of fishing and would like to fish not hunt all day for a couple of small eyeballs. Share some of you recent stasis please."
4959353,1jigfish2,2016-06-30 15:55:00,110,"Not sure what lake you are reading about either. We fish the lake for walleye opener and again late in fall for the last 9 years. We catch all size walleye, never fish for anything else. You can catch all you want, 5 of us caught 702 walleye for the week. Our biggest this spring was 26 1/2"" which was smaller than normal. Last fall big was 31 3/8"", last spring 30 1/2"". We do nothing but jig with minnow. I call those trophies in any water."
4959369,prov1800,2016-06-30 16:06:00,5010,I took some guys out Monday staying at cedar point resort.caught a lot of walleyes of all sizes and a bunch of crappies.great day.
4959513,CatchemwhileUcan,2016-06-30 17:55:00,4,Thanks to all who replied it seems like getting some bad information. Thanks a bunch for the good report.

4960473,SinOrSwim,2016-07-01 07:59:00,1528,Here is a link to current fishing reports. Clarks does an amazing job updating their site and their facebook page. Let's hope its accurate since this is where we are going. LOL http://yournorthernconnection.com/ca...ishing-reports
4962561,prov1800,2016-07-02 05:53:00,5010,There report is pretty accurate.by the time your group gets there in sept fishing patterns will have changed.the east end of cedar always fishes faster in the early stages of the season.then by late june mid july thecwest end starts turning on.
