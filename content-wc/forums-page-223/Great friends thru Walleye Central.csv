Did not think I would be able to make the annual trip this year to Lake St Joe due to work commitments. Just a couple of days before the rest of the guys headed up, I caught a break and found a way to salvage 5 days of fishing, but needed a little help to make it work. My very good friends stjoeguy and hewhocookstoomuch sacrificed several hours of fishing to make a 50 mile round trip boat ride to pick me up at the landing. Certainly not something that all folks would have done and I am so grateful to them for what they did and this community that allowed me to meet them in the first place 5 years ago. Thanks again guys!!! Pat"

Most folks are on here for the same reason, we like to fish and chat about it. There is always something to be learned here and guys are willing to share. Some are full of crap, but they are easy to ""filter"" out and there are many ""lurkers"" who never contribute, but scour for information. They are mostly harmless!All the above make for a fantastic site.Pooch"

One of the outstanding attributes of this site is that the vast majority of folks are people with whom most of us would want to be friends. A more helpful, pleasant crowd would be difficult to find out of most any other gathering of like-interest folks. Bill"

He was very letdown when we found out last year our date at St. Joe would be a conflict at his job. Thank goodness it all worked out. Stjoe guy needs all the help he can get to keep me straight. Our banter helps us get through when the bite is slow and the weather is down right miserable. It helps a lot when he bring a good supply of Little Debbie snack cakes. hey, we are half way to a crappy day (20 fish in the boat)"
