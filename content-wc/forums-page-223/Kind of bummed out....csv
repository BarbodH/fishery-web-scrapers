4969001,rnnonmt,2016-07-05 18:05:00,992,Jimi's sheep!
4930553,rnnonmt,2016-06-15 16:08:00,992,"This is the first year in a while I haven't been able to make my annual trip to Lac Seul with my family and friends in many years. My trip is usually a group of 12-18 really great folks that always seem to entertain. I am a bit bummed because I have to sit this years trip out due to work so I need my other family, the WC folks (all 2 of them - Jimi and Pat --- just kidding I have like 3 or 4 maybe LOL) that I enjoy chatting with so much on here to attach all of your big catch pics and funny mishap stories so I can live my trip through yours. I hope that all of you that make it up to the great north country this year have an exceptional memorable trip and catch your personal bests!Be safe - Have fun.... and post your pics!!!Brian"
4931569,Larry S,2016-06-16 08:49:00,665,"Brian, You are Not the only person Bummed Out. Won't be able to go on my annual fly-in trip due to family and work obligations. As the date for the trip (End of June to Early July) arrives I get more antsy because I know that I'm stuck here not pulling in Walleyes and drinking gin& tonics with my fishing friends. I will get through this and next Year Will Appreciate the annual trip a LOT MORE!! So You are Not Alone My Friend Larry S"
4932505,pjshorthorn,2016-06-16 14:26:00,5654,"Oh there will be many stories to be told from my trips alone !!! Some of the stories may actually be ""somewhat "" true Now as far as Jimi's trip, I'm sure that anything is possible but I have a feeling that a blow up goat will somehow be part of the storyline.....just a gut feel. I guess letting you know that I'm leaving for Lake of The Woods tomorrow night won't make you feel any better. Sorry Bro ðŸ˜­ PjShorthorn."
4932569,uv2021,2016-06-16 14:46:00,48,"Due to a mild winter I did not get my week of wilderness ice fishing in.I know how you feel,weird,out of place,missing something. I run my own business,so I have been pissed off lately,not relaxed. So we are doing a shorty 5 day trip to lady evelynn staring this sunday. It's only a six hour drive. I have my tackle spread out all over the living room floor. It won't be easy,but you will survive."
4932769,rnnonmt,2016-06-16 15:46:00,992,Thanks for the words of encouragement guys. Im certain leading up to next years trip will be that more exciting and rewarding too. Pat - I hope you see Gord wearing nothing but a speedo and that image is burned into your memory forever. Have a great trip on LOW. Are you heading to VB again too?
4932889,Mike Borger,2016-06-16 16:29:00,1554,"Sorry to hear fellas, that bites!Larry....I feel your pain."
4933361,pjshorthorn,2016-06-16 21:10:00,5654,"Dude, I just got back from a trip to Vegas to celebrate our son's 21st birthday. I'm still trying to unsee some of the stuff that I passed on the strip while we were there. Gord has nothing on that stuff ; even if his kilt is a little short when bending over to pull weeds around the lodge grounds....ðŸ˜³ Yup, heading back to V-Bay at the end of July with Gramps , Stickman and Breezy. The thing that concerns me a little bit is whether or not I can survive another trip of beaver dam jumping. Apparently , Canadian beavers use the metric system too....... PjShorthorn"
4934321,jimirjr,2016-06-17 12:42:00,1149,"THE ""SHEEP"" goes everywhere with My group.... S--T Brian... You'll need to live vicariously through Pat and I... Till next year, anyway..."
4934785,pjshorthorn,2016-06-17 16:12:00,5654,"I stand corrected.....it is a SHEEP !!!!!! And here I was contemplating making a suggestion that the three of us put together a HB extravaganza one year on Lac Seul. I'm OK with goats.....SHEEP, not so much Come on Jimi , full disclosure, what did you name that SHEEP ???? Brian, when I send you some new lures, do I still need to label the package ""fishing porn"" ? At the airport on the way to LOTW so I'll be sure to write a long trip report so Brian has some reading material in the bathroom . PjShorthorn."
4935201,wallydave,2016-06-17 21:08:00,2151,"I've have been there too. It just plain sucks! Using share a seat has helped in putting a couple of trips together. Hang in there, if Canadian trips are in the cards, you will be able to put a couple of trips together. Good luck!,"
