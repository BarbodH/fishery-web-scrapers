4973081,kzoofisher,2016-07-07 17:35:00,5144,"Good info, guys. I was wondering if you were in cabbage of thicker slop. I always have some jigs with weed guards for coontail, not a lot of cabbage locally. I've got a large flat circled on the map to explore this year and I'll be especially interested to check out cabbage beds there. May even try Texas rigged ring worm."
4973113,prov1800,2016-07-07 17:43:00,5010,Worked the regular cabbage.mostly 7-10 ft stuff.and at times we caught them out from the cabbage in 15 ft. Where are you fishing out of.
4974177,kzoofisher,2016-07-08 03:24:00,5144,"I'll be east of Superior, near Chapleau, on Windermere at the end of August. Third year there there and every year I try to pick out an area to thoroughly explore in the afternoons. We've done OK in shoreline weedbeds at the back of bays but the open water ones in smaller bays have proved pretty thick. I'm thinking this very large flay may have scattered beds that will have easier edges to fish, or get right in the thick of them with weedless plastics and bait dropped into openings. The last two years I focused mostly on finding humps and reefs, time to expand my search and get more options when the weather turns. One thing that has held us back is the fear of rocks but we're planning on packing lunch and doing slow passes with a split screen and the SI set at max distance. I'll mark any beds or rock piles and we'll go back to them, if not that day then the next. The lake has only a paper map so there are a lot of unknowns."

First time i have guided there.have to admit its a great lodge.back to fishing.first trip for me this year.had heard it was slower than normal.reports where right.found it slow.but some snooping and digging around managed to found a couple of spots that worked out.found thecbest and consistent bite in the weed beds.very aggressive bite.kept trying mid lake spots throughout the 4 days and things did not improve.best bite besides weeds was sandbars and mud flats nearvthe island's.today and yesterday found walleyes on points down to 25 ft.but best depth seemed to be 21 ft.lindy rigs out did jigs 10-1.we caught a lot of 25-27"" fish this week.these came from deeper water where the weed walleyes tended to be moreceater sized with some slots mixed in.today we had some incredible fishing early in thd day for a couple of hrs.amazing how many big fish we pulled up.then back to thecweed beds for quick action as we had a 10 year old in the boat. getting back to a old pist concernjng eagle vs lac suel.as much as i love fishing on eagle and j do you will never get the fishing size wisecas you would on lac suel.any body boosting they do on eagle has never fished lac suel."

4971537,prov1800,2016-07-07 06:43:00,5010,Bring them on.i just tell it like it is.haha.
4971601,prov1800,2016-07-07 07:11:00,5010,Hers a couple of good fish from eagle from last weekend when i got out with my wife.
4971769,mwh624,2016-07-07 08:25:00,183,what was the water temp?
4971785,Carnhzkr,2016-07-07 08:29:00,964,"Completely agree with your report on LS. I was up at Fisherman's Cove from 6/25 - 7/1. My impression was that the quality fish, say 24""+, were biting as typical. No problem catching our expected numbers of those. But the eaters just didn't seem active for some reason, so overall numbers were the lowest I've had on 8 trips to LS. I fished a new-to-me area - way down south in the South Inlet. I've fished the sandbanks in the inlet and around Hungry Narrows before, but this was my fist time venturing down south. I really liked that area. It's much more scenic than the large expanse of the main lake, and I hadn't realized there was a nice falls coming in. We found one particular honey hole off an island that we frequented throughout the week. We caught maybe 2 dozen fish in that area and I don't think any of them were under 23"", fishing between 18 - 24'. We have two weed beds that worked for 14 - 16 inchers for dinner, although there were a couple evenings we had to stay longer than planned to fill out our quota for the evening meal. You know how that goes, ""that one's too big, that one's too small..."". The perfect size seems to elude you when you're hungry. I've always used crawlers to equal success as minnows on LS, but that week minnows easily out fished the worms. I found that odd, especially since the mayfly carcasses were littering the water. I always assumed when the hatch was in full swing, that was the time to use crawlers. When I opened fish for filleting, I did notice they were feeding on minnows. Maybe the hatch was coming to its end. Even though numbers were off, we still had a great trip. To paraphrase another poster, Lac Seul is like sex and pizza; even when it's bad, it's still pretty good."
4971945,kzoofisher,2016-07-07 10:12:00,5144,What did you guys use in the weeds?
4972009,tv4fish,2016-07-07 10:52:00,2694,kzoo: When we were up on Lac Seul (6-18 through 6-25) we also found the smaller walleyes in the shallow weed beds off islands. We caught them the same way we do when we were catching the bigger guys in deeper water. We vertical jig with crawlers and leeches. Many times we had doubles and triples. We were fishing weed beds in 6-8 feet of water.
4972105,Carnhzkr,2016-07-07 11:28:00,964,"Like tv4fish said, we fished the same way. I preferred a minnow on an 1/8 oz jig. Plastics worked too. We weren't deep into the weeds, pretty much trolled the edge. I'd toss my jig into the cabbage, but they weren't too thick. Prior to the trip, in anticipation of fishing weed beds, I had purchased a few 1/8 oz jigs with a weed guard. I thought they'd work great to use a plastic such as a ringworm and toss it back into the thickest part of the weed bed, then slowly drag it out, hopping along the bottom. And it worked too, well sort of. I only used one for about 10 minutes and after three hits but no fish in the boat I decided the weed guard was preventing the hookups so I 86'd them."
4972265,prov1800,2016-07-07 12:06:00,5010,Main lake was around 67 f.
