Group of 8 of us heading there June 4 - 11 (3rd consecutive year @ this lake). Only thing I'm hearing is early ice out. Thanks for any information anyone can provide.

No doubt the trip will be great...I hear the water is rich in walleye with lots of current. Spawning is right now so you should hit it in full swing. Enjoy!
