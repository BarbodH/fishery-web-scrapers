After doing a scrub of the internet seems like Lount lake might fit the bill here. Much experience on this lake? I believe there are some drive to camps on the lake but they are far from the outpost that Nestorfalls has, so fishing pressure still not an issue? Would love any experiences on the lake. Not necessarily looking for trophy fish, but would love good numbers and a relatively easy lake to fish (we're KS boys, used to chasing whisker fish not toothy critters)."
