4967561,CamoHunter,2016-07-05 07:56:00,363,"Looks like water level is almost the same as I had last year leading up to our trip, only a few inches lower this year than last year. Don't believe me? Go here: https://wateroffice.ec.gc.ca/google_...ON&doSearch=Go It's a good site to take a look at to see how water levels compare to other years.Canada has numerous stream gauge stations, just like we do in the U.S. There are three stream gauges on Lac Seul which report water levels every 30 minutes. One at Goldpines near Ear Falls, one at Lac Seul Outpost in middle of lake, and one at Hudson at SE part of lake.O5QB001 Station at Lac Seul Outpost (middle of lake):July 5, 2015: 356.169m, 1168.53ftJuly 5, 2016: 356.094m, 1168.29ft"

4964313,grumbler,2016-07-03 10:17:00,10,"will be up there this Saturday the 9th , 25 + years interested in the lake level and how high are the weeds compared to this time of the year"
4964449,greg2648,2016-07-03 12:04:00,80,I would be interested in this info as well. We will be in the NW arm on Saturday 7/9.
4964465,Pooch,2016-07-03 12:17:00,4619,"Was at Lac Seul Lodge two weeks ago and I felt the lake was down nearly two feet. I really doubt it has risen much higher than that, yet. Weeds were sparse compared to past years and that surprised me somewhat. I think they have been getting rain lately so that sure will help. When we left we drove in scattered hard rain untill we hit Fort Francis.Shallow areas that were of little concern in the past were nerve wracking two weeks ago. I know this is fairly outdated information, but I saw no one jumping in to help you. We were there nearly two weeks earlier this year so that may have made the lower water levels more noticeable to me. Hoping everything is back to normal pool for our August trip.Pooch"
4964489,greg2648,2016-07-03 12:29:00,80,We will be staying at Lac Seul Lodge as well.
4964585,Carnhzkr,2016-07-03 13:26:00,964,"Just returned from Fisherman's Cove late last night. Lake was down about 18"" from last year by my guess. We got rained on quite a bit last week. Some really heavy downpours. In fact, one person in the cabin next to ours claimed to have been struck by lightning while on Scout Lake. If so, he was extremely lucky because he was walking around none the worse for it. As Pooch mentioned, weeds did seem more sparse than in previous years. Overall, our fishing success agreed with the previous reports I'd read - pretty slow for what I've become accustomed to on LS. For some reason, the bight hasn't turned on just yet. We did get our share of quality fish, but the 16 - 19 inchers weren't bighting like they typically do."
