4899337,tv4fish,2016-06-04 15:27:00,2694,"If you and your wife want a very nice modern housekeeping cabin - I might suggest the Red Pine Lodge which is just south of Sioux Lookout. Very decent rates - it's right on water that you CAN use to fish Abrams, Minnitaki and even Lac Seul if you want to boat a little ways. They even have a cabin set up for just a couple."
4900481,Sooner fan,2016-06-05 06:36:00,6,Donnelly's Minnitaki Lodge on lake minnitaki south of Sioux Lookout is a great camp. There are may areas close to camp to fish that are out of the wind. I have been going there for years and Darrell and Allan Donnelly are the nicest guys and they are very helpful and they know the lake well.
4901505,pitbull,2016-06-05 13:20:00,45,"You may want to look at Air-Dale Lodge, they have housekeeping cabins, lots of water, very nice hosts. They are located near Hawk Junction, ON At Whitefish Lake."

4957657,LacSeulSam,2016-06-29 22:40:00,9,"Hi,My wife and I have just opened a place on Lac Seul. We have a beautiful place on the lake available. The previous poster is correct in that there are a number of places to fish on Lac Seul that are protected from the bigger part of lake. We are located on the Lac Seul First Nation fifteen minutes from Hudson, ON. We have a three bedroom cottage available. This cottage has all the amenities of home, fridge, stove, furnace, two bathrooms, hot and cold water, pots, pans, dishes, cutlery, deck, outdoor fire place, BBQ, kayak, paddle board.Sam"
4957977,prov1800,2016-06-30 06:32:00,5010,If your looking for a smaller lake i wouldcsuggest checking out cedar lake.easy to navigate and but very fishable on a windier day.has a good crappie population as a bonus.i would recommend looking at clarks northern light resort cedar point resort
4958785,Steeks7882,2016-06-30 11:13:00,9,I would love some information on your place Sam! I sent you a private message
4961657,Ricky Spanish,2016-07-01 15:41:00,1298,"I don't think you are supposed to eat fish out of clay lake, but I might not be remembering correctly. It has been several years."
4898201,ksand774,2016-06-04 08:31:00,51,"I am looking for a drive in fishing camp in Ontario for late July. This would be for my Wife and myself. We live in the Minneapolis area. We like to fish a variety of fish. We also like to eat fish on vacation and bring some home. We are catch and release on any trophy fish. We would like a nice cabin. My wife will not fish in the rough water so I am guessing that will eliminate Lacsuel. Any suggestions would be appreciated. We have fished Wabaskang, Cedar in the past and we are looking for lake with less camps on it. I am considering Camp Quetico, Separation lake camp, a camp on Red Lake. We mainly fish walleye, Smallies, Northern, Trout and crappie. Thank you four help."
4898313,pjshorthorn,2016-06-04 08:55:00,5654,Vermilion Bay Lodge on Eagle Lake would fit all the criteria mentioned. PjShorthorn.
4898337,NARDA 1,2016-06-04 09:02:00,636,Check out Birch Dale Lodge 807-227-5262 owners name is Marcel www.birchdalelodge.com on Eagle Lake. They have a unique American Plan where you order from a menu instead of everyone eating the same thing. They also have 2 cabins with Hot Tubs in them.
4898609,bigwalleye1,2016-06-04 10:06:00,2632,Bringing a boat or do you require one from camp? Don't sell Lac Seul short. The proper camp choice can have you with smaller portions of the lake to fish where the water isn't as huge.
4898625,ksand774,2016-06-04 10:16:00,51,I would like to do a package with a boat and cabin if possible. I have not fished Lacsuel so I have just heard that it can get pretty rough.
4898649,ftfarms,2016-06-04 10:31:00,444,If your wanting a lake with not many camps on it I would suggest clay lake or maybe cliff lake. I do love separation lake for walleye and smallmouth. I don't like the last 27 miles of the drive but if your not taking a boat it's not a big deal. We take our own boat so it almost 2 hours to drive the 27 miles. Trying to prevent rock chips.
4898809,Bstar,2016-06-04 11:24:00,564,"You might want to check out Stormer Lake Lodge north of Red Lake. It's a drive to camp and the only camp on two lakes. The lakes are medium sized and look to be easy to navigate. They have walleye,smallmouth and pike. Very reasonable American plan. Looks like they have nice accomadations and boats. I haven't been there myself but I've been keeping an eye on it for a future trip."
4898897,ksand774,2016-06-04 11:43:00,51,We are looking for a house keeping plan. On vacation I do not like to be on a schedule. A lot of times we will have our big meal at lunch. That frees us up for fishing in the evening. Plus we like to eat fish for several meals.
4898913,Pooch,2016-06-04 11:46:00,4619,"It will be more of a challenge to find an opening at most camps this late. Worth a try though.Not exactly a drive in camp, but close is Wildewood on Lake Savant. Park in their lot and they take you into camp via a trail. Older (but decent) and new cabins. Small camp with really good fishing everywhere on the lake. Housekeeping only. They furnish boats, gas, bait, etc..http://wildewoodonlakesavant.com/One of my favorite lakes. Walleye, Northern, Lake trout lake. No smallies.Just an option.Pooch"
4899017,Bstar,2016-06-04 12:26:00,564,Sorry......it was just a suggestion.
