520124,Guest,2002-05-13 06:19:00,0,"Due to recent layoffs at a local plant, I have openings on a walley fishing trip departing from Omaha on May 24 and returning on June 1, 2002. The cost of the trip is $700.00 and includes transportation to the camp, cabins, boats, motors, minnows and meals at the camp. This is an excellent opportunity for anyone who wants to fish opening week on an excellent walleye lake. I have been going to this particular lake for the last seven years. I have been going annually to Canada for the past 19 years. Prefer groups of two. Please contact Dean Broich at 402-829-0121 if seriously interested and I will either fax or mail you an itinerary. Thanks........Dean Broich"
