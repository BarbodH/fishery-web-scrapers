519959,Mahumba,2002-05-12 11:02:00,345,Just drove through there on Friday. The ice is OUT! What was left took a beating from the wind on that day.Roger Mayer.
519960,Toolman,2002-05-12 14:01:00,2570,Thanks to all for the updates. Is there still any snow left? It looks like from the weather reports that lows are still below 0*C (I know that one!!). I was also wondering what water temperature to expect on Lake Appisibago. It's 35-40 ft deep and what I would call a medium to small lake with little inflow/outflow. Thanks.Tim
519961,Melonbob_ON,2002-05-12 16:12:00,61,"No snow left up here either for that point, but Wawa seems to keep getting some. Don't worry, it doesn't stay....lol! I'd expect water temps to be in the mid to high 40's, depending on how far north this place is..."
519947,Toolman,2002-05-08 09:16:00,2570,"Heading up to a fly-in trip next weekend to a lake north of Wawa, Ontario next weekend. Does anyone know if the ice is gone in that area yet? The base camp at Wawa still had ice as of Monday, i think. ThanksTim"
519948,Wawajake,2002-05-08 09:58:00,413,"Your right, Wawa Lake was still frozen when I drove by May 5th however that same weekend most of the lakes that got the wind the right direction broke up and were ice free May 5th. I have been watching Wawa weather myself and I am confident given weather this week already and rain and temps later this week ,any left should all be gone in next few days. I live across the road from Airdale in Sault Ste Marie where they store their beaver planes they use in summer up north in Hawk Junction and even other northern outfitter companies store their Beaver planes for winter repairs. Well only two of the 20 stored there are left as of yesterday, so that means they went north and landed at their outpost lakes for season starts. jake"
519949,Melonbob_ON,2002-05-08 16:34:00,61,"Talked to my mother in wawa today, all lakes were clear as of Tuesday!!! Happy fishing!!!"
519950,Guest,2002-05-08 19:29:00,0,"Sorry, But it seems to me that one of the above is incorrect!!!Dave"
519951,Melonbob_ON,2002-05-08 19:47:00,61,"Well, I was at Hawk lake on Sunday, it was 3/4 open, I have no doubt believing my mother if she says it's open yesterday. Either way, I guarantee it will be by this weekend....(:"
519952,Toolman,2002-05-09 08:11:00,2570,"Mellonbob,We fly out of Hawk Junction on the 18th. I think it's Hawk Lake? Hope it warms up on the 17th. Look out walleye (and pike)!! The lake we're flying to is about 150-200 miles north (est). I guess that's about 90-120 Km. Is the ice off up there? Thanks for the info everyone.Tim"
519953,Melonbob_ON,2002-05-09 14:01:00,61,"Toolman,Are you flying with Hawk Air or Air Dale? If it's Air Dale, my kid brother will be your dock boy. His name is Neil, tip him well!!!! Lol, Actually, he's pretty excited about his new job, Hawk lake is open now, and I'm sure all will be by the 18th(my birthday). Can't think of a better way to spend it either!! Good luck on your trip!Bob"
519954,Melonbob_ON,2002-05-09 14:04:00,61,"BTW..... 150 miles would be about 240 kilometres, 200 miles would be about 320 kilometres.....ya went the wrong way there!!!"
519955,Toolman,2002-05-10 04:45:00,2570,"Melonbob,Oops. I guess that's why I got that $360 dollar speeding ticket in Sault St. Marie 2 years ago (ouch)! I was never any good at those conversions. We are flying Air-Dale. 6 or 7 years now (my fourth). All really good trips (except for the snow two different years lol). I wish I could remember the name of the lake we are going to. We've been to John's Lake and this one. I have temporary brain lock. I think it's Lake Appisabigo. Thanks for the info. Keep me updated on the weather, if you have time. It sounds like it will be cold, but warming later next week (just in time). Thanks.Tim"
519956,Guest,2002-05-10 08:08:00,0,"Hey ToolMan, we are also going to be flying out of Hawk Lake with Air-dale, we will be flying in the day you are flying out, we are going to Medhurst lake, do you ever remember going to that one?"
