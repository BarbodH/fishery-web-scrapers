I've had pretty good success (in my mind) on catching walleye and pike...but a person can always learn new techniques. I'm expecting 42-45*F water temps (main lake) Slightly higher in the shallow bays. So what's your favorite patterns / techniques for walleye? Pike?Mine are jig/plastic or jig/minnow (deeper) or shallow minnow bait (shallower) for walleye. For pike it would be slow rolled spinnerbait or slow cranked/twitched shallow diving minnow bait. I also like to longline troll cranks for 'eyes. I CAN'T WAIT!! Thanks for the input everyone.Tim"
