520008,Guest,2002-05-09 07:56:00,0,"That may be true, but there is one way to tell that you're clearly misguided...Do you discuss how you nailed your girlfriend in an alley while sitting in church? Do you arrive at an AA meeting drunk with a bottle in your hand? Then why would you stir the pot of national relations on a walleye fishing discussion board? There is a place for everything, and your comments (or attempt at humor) are hopelessly lost. Go back to your MTV and PlayStation2....you're just wasting space on this forum."

520010,Guest,2002-05-09 10:17:00,0,I am proud of our pet Sasquatch though he has developed an appetite for arrogant Americans.....He is getting heavier and this is unhealthy. We are encouraging him to develop an appetite for slim Americans but there doesn't seem to be a lot of those around. I am proud to be Americas attic.....I found all kinds of interesting things up here and we get to make the rules about who comes here. Great fishing Guys LOL

And a third and strictly bonus sign, You walk to the fence of your most trusted neighbour, who has been there through thick and thin, and toss your garbage over it's heights."
