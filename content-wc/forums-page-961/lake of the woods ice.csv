520074,Guest,2002-05-11 11:36:00,0,"Help! Been fishing walleye opener at same resort on LOW since 89. Have only been iced out once, (95) when the ice went out on May 16th. We stay at Spruce Island about 7 miles east of Oak Island. Monday the owner of the resort tried to get there to get the cabins ready for the opener. He couldn't get there from Morson marina on Hanson's Bay. Little Traverse Bay had frozen back over!! I know the ice around the area we fish is open as evidence by the webcam on Flagg Island. (www.yahooey.com) Am concerned that our group may have to make last minute plans for another body of water. Does anyone know if the ice has went out yet, between Morson and Oak Island? Would greatly appreciate any information.Eagerly awaitiog the opener,EYE-OWA from Iowa"
