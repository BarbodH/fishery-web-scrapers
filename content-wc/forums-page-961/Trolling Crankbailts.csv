This guide provides the different lengths of line off the reel required to place individual crankbaits at prescribed depths. For each crankbait tested, they provide a dive curve. According to their web site (www.precisionangling.com), the guide retails for 24.95 USD.Use of the guide will necessitate the purchase of a line counter reel if you don't already have one. Jay"
