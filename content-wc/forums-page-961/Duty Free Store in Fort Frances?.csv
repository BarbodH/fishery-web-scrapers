Wierd, though, you can't carry anything out of the store. after you pay you get back in your vehicle & pickup your purchases just before you enter the drive into the customs checkpoint.Parking was OK last year, can get a little tight Sat AM with all the returning fisherfolk. Also the store is the place you can get a refund on most of the tax you pay to stay at your lodge. 13 days & counting!!"
520071,fishinnut,2002-05-11 05:39:00,642,The reason you can't carry anything out is to insure that the goods leave the country.
