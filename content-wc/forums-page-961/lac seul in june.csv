520025,Guest,2002-05-09 10:52:00,0,I am going to the south part of lac seul in early june and would like to know what the best bait is for this time of year. I am going to be stay at williams lake resort. thanks
520026,lunker99,2002-05-10 11:29:00,236,We fish on lac suel up around ear falls during early june and always do good with jigs and twisters and really good with slip bobbers tipped with leeches or crawlers. Like to find windy points and fish in the 4' to 10' range. Hope this helps.
520027,Guest,2002-05-11 15:36:00,0,"Thanks, Have you ever used night crawler harnesses on lac seul. I read a post that said thats the best way to go on lac seul."
520028,lunker99,2002-05-11 19:43:00,236,"Yes, have used them a few times when playing around. Seem to get a fair share of hammer handles on them along with the walleye, though. Have found whenever we catch walleyes in an area trolling with harnesses, that we can catch more walleyes even quicker (and usually larger) if we go ahead and anchor in that area and switch to the jigs and slip bobbers. In the areas that we usually fish, there will normally be someone trolling around pulling harnesses or cranks and pick up a fish here and there, while we'll sit in one spot and pick up fish almost one after another using the slower finesse tactics."
