520076,tracker,2002-05-11 14:23:00,91,"Well Eric, first thing we need to know is are you a non-resident which I'm quessing you are. In Ontario a non-resident under the age of 18 does not need a fishing license but any fish he catches are part of your catch and possesion limit. For him to keep a limit you have the option of buying him a license."
520077,Eric,2002-05-11 17:52:00,114,Thank you tracker. We are c+r so I guess I can save a few bucks. Can't wait to go with my son. Eric
