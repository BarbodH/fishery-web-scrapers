Fish with light jigs and crappie size twisters for a hint of color, light because the fish will be shallow and on this part of Lac Seul; they will be in muddy bottomed areas with brushy cover chasing shinners that are there to get warm. Fish low, tight to bottom with suttle jigging action; lift a couple times and pause on bottom for the pick up. Fish slow, that pause on the bottom is important for the pick up, fish almost like your ice fishing; it's darn cold down there just at ice out. Still a bit of ice today in lake, should be out by weekend as it's breaking up fast and whats there is real soft."
