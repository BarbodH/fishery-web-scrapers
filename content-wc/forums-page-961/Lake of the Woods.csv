519307,eyeman_1,2002-05-11 06:09:00,690,"I've fished out of Totem's Wiley Point Lodge the last two seasons in late July and the fishing there has been tremendous for eyes, smallies, big pike, and the occaisional muskie! Check the deep reefs near the narrows w/spinners & bouncers and keep moving till you find fish. Not every reef will have fish on them but the better reefs had a stair step drop. If the fish quit keep moving. Another tip, some times the fish quit on the spinners and I'll go back in w/jig and powerbait or leeches and crawlwer, or Lindy no snages and snells. The other thing I'd not overlook is that sometimes the fish on the reefs move off and suspend at the same depth you were catching them on the reefs. Troll cranks at the same depths adjacent to the reefs and see what happens.Better yet contact Totem for a stay at Wiley and tell the I sent you. The owner Eric Brown has a great staff and the head of fisheries Claude has some excellent guides working with him. The ride to Wiley is beautiful and about 40 minutes. It's a way cool place, my wife and I spent our honeymoon there in '00 and went with 16 of our closet friends last year.Good luck and hope this helps.Jim"
519308,Rather Be Lucky,2002-05-11 08:42:00,256,I second the houseboat trip. We use Floating Lodges out of Souix Narrows. We also go around that time of year. Always find lots of 'eyes and crappies. Whats nice is you put your cabin anywhere you want...no running long distances to fish an area for a while. Good Luck with your choice. Swede
