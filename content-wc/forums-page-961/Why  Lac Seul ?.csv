519185,2 DOGS,2002-04-12 07:04:00,361,"Both presentations work. I prefer spinners w/minnow and back trolling others have good success with jig / minnow. Experiment! You can go from 50' to 1' in a heartbeat, get to know the area. Your lodge operator should provide you with a decent map. LOOK AT IT!! Put the big ones back. Good fishin."
519186,Walleye Wacker,2002-04-12 09:06:00,6,"Andy, You might want to try some Leechs in lieu of Minnows. When I first started taking my boys to Lac Seul they were about the same age as yours. The leechs seem to stay on better and when the boys get a bite they may have a little slower reaction in responding to the bite. I think it is easier to hook up on Leechs and if you asked my boys now 32 and 35 they caught a lot of eyes on Lac Seul when they were pups on Leechs (and they still do). I have taken my Grandsons (9&11) the last two years and they enjoy a lot of hook ups on eyes with Leechs on a jig. When useing a jig hook the Leech so his mouth is faceing up...better maovement...Good Luck and enjoy those boys."
519187,Anglin Andy,2002-04-12 10:03:00,100,"Thank you very much for the responses and the information. Both of my boys like to fish and we practice ""CPR"", it should be a fun time. Anglin Andy"
519188,Guest,2002-04-15 05:19:00,0,"Yes I did have to travel up to 20 mi, to get on fish.I go fishing to catch fish not look at trees and birds I do that when I'm not fishing. TV show can be misleading it's amazing what can be in a editing room."
519177,Guest,2002-05-06 09:54:00,0,I tried to find a good topo map w/out any luck. Where can you buy one???
519178,Guest,2002-05-06 18:25:00,0,"We issue a lake hydo/topo map to all our guests when they arrive with major hazards, navigation aids and the current hot spots all marked. I don't have time or maps for everyone, but if you stop in and buy a coffie and share a few stories we may be able to scare one up for you"
519189,Guest,2002-05-11 07:34:00,0,"We go out of Williams Lake Lodge on southwest end and fish that area of the lake. Same program the last 3 years. We stay at an outpost cabin there right across from mouth of Williams crrek that dumps into Williams Bay of LacSeul. We can fish all week and not see many other boats, and walleye success has been tremendous. Have it booked for 7-6 - 7-13 this year. Can accomodate 8 and only have 4 going. Wouldn't mind picking up a couple of guys that like to fish and drink a few beers."
519173,Guest,2002-04-10 06:18:00,0,"I,ve been reading alot of post on Lac Seul and must say you have to travel a long way to catch fish is this right. Also watched tv show on Lac Seul they said there were 3 camp on the whole lake is this true."
519174,Guest,2002-04-10 06:26:00,0,"Not to sure that the talk about only 3 options to stay on Lac Seul, I have only been there once and can think of three off the top of my head and I am sure there are many more. Why Lac Seul for me is because when we go up to fish and stay at an outpost, we will go all week long and pretty much not see any other guys out fishing...Its pretty quiet...not to mention great fishing."
519175,Jigger1,2002-04-10 06:50:00,234,"There are a number of lodges on Lac Seul, a concentration of them are located in the general area of Ear Falls and quite possibly where you hear about the majority of the long commutes to fish. I too originally saw a fishing show on Lac Seul that motivated me to complete some research on the lake, reservoir actually. As a teen I had fished Lake of the Woods and Eagle Lake with my Dad, now as the father of a teen I was going to take my kids fishing.I ended up emailing six lodges on Lac Seul and only heard back from three. One of them, albeit what appeared to be the most expensive, had the most compelling proposition I had ever read. I'm now headed back for my third consecutive year and all of the walleyes over 27Â” landed in my boat have been within 5-15 minutes of the lodge. A handful of them came within sight of the lodge! I fish the central part of the lake at a place called Silver Water Wheel Lodge. I had mentioned that it appeared to be the most expensive, but when you consider there are no additional fees other than tips or your favorite adult beverage you want to bring in, I think it's a steal for the quality of fishing and experience. I also understand there are several lodges located further to the east with similar fishing proximity available to them.Good luck on your search, I'm sold on Lac Seul."
519176,Walleye Wacker,2002-04-10 07:02:00,6,"Lac Seul has numerous options for lodging. Many of the outfitters also have Outposts that will give you seclusion. The lake itself is a delight to fish as long as you avoid striking rockpiles with your boat. This jagged structure is the main reason that Lac Seul is a excellent fishery. It gives the Walleyes a wide variance of structure and promotes a excellent forage base. A GPS is a must if you are going to travel to areas that you are unfamiler with. You can mark ""HOTSPOTS"" and get home without getting lost behind one of Lac Seuls thousands of islands. Every corner on the lake holds the promise of great fishing and the scenery and wildlife will be a bonus. There are great topo maps avaliable and the outfitters are eager to assist putting you on fish.....Good Luck...Catch and Release"
519179,NateW,2002-04-10 10:04:00,96,"I'm not so sure you ""have"" to travel so far or make long commutes to get on fish. We'ce caught fish all over Lac Seul. However, the temptation is just to great give up a bunch of fish to travel to a spot where you'll be on an obscene amount of fish. Besides, if you're only fishing a mile from camp you don't have a reason to shorelunch!We frequently travel more than an hour one-way from camp not because we have to but because we want to. The lake is so big and has so many ""undiscovered"" little reefs and bays the exploration is almost as fun as the fishing! As stated above, relax & enjoy the view."
519180,Big Tim,2002-04-10 12:06:00,63,"Lots more than 3 places to stay. & yes you can travel a long way (At least in the spring) Is an hour ride on a pristine lake such a chore? I've only been there in the spring, but from what I've read the walleye spread out all over the lake later in the year. so maybe you don't have to drive the boat so far. For me. I'll drive that boat an hour one way to be able to boat more than 100 darn good sized walleye in a day. I bet I put a heck of a lot more hours on a boat trying to find that kind of action anywhere else. At least for the price & convience of being able to drive into the cottage. Lac Seul is 120 miles long. Alomost anywhere you stay will have so many secluded bays, inlets & islands I'm sure you could spend all week within a few miles of camp, catch a fair amount of fish & probably not see another boat until you head back to the dock. Any way you cut it Lac Seul has the fish & the scenery to make a wonderful vacation"
519181,2 DOGS,2002-04-11 09:09:00,361,"Rog, somebody has misled you. I stay at Evergreen Lodge, Ear Falls area, and have to tell you I can think of 7-8 camps within 5 miles of Ear Falls. In the spring and fall I can be on all the fish I want within 5 minutes of camp. Mid-summer within 7 minutes. Yes, I do make some longer runs from camp, but not because I have to. This is a beautiful area with lots of wildlife and I enjoy running down the lake, well, just because I can. There are a gazillion good fishing spots and I'd like to try them all. Several years ago, my fishing partners and I realized we were consistently going to the same 5-6 areas and really not experiencing the lake. Now we never go to the same spot 2 days in a row and every Wednesday is the day to try some locations we've never fished before. It is a fantastic lake!"
519182,Anglin Andy,2002-04-11 12:36:00,100,"2 Dogs and any other fisher people that would like to get us started in the right direction. I will be taking my sons (8 and 6) fishing to Lac Seul the first week of July, we will be staying at Little Beaver Lodge near Ear Falls. Could you give us some areas that will be close-- within a 1/2 hour or so of Little Beaver Lodge. Our first choice is to fish for Walleye's and second will be some Northern fishing. Thank you very much. Anglin Andy"
519183,2 DOGS,2002-04-11 14:25:00,361,"Try the islands directly in front of your camp and keep working east. You'll see an island with a monument and flag (Goose island) there are numerous reefs and structure all around that island. Another just to the south of that one with a marker on it (Sand Island) numerous reefs. Be careful, many aren't marked."
519184,Anglin Andy,2002-04-12 05:15:00,100,"2 DOGS--Thank you very much, what type of presentation should a person be using in early July? Spinners and ???? to find them and then jig?Thanks again, Anglin Andy"
