519416,Guest,2002-04-20 12:27:00,0,Hello LoboI was wondering if you are checking the ice conditions--have a friend in Manitouwadge still plenty of ice on the lake in town as you know I am going north of Pickle Lake about 80 miles and I think you are going farther north than that if you get any news I would appreciate hearing from you.[email protected]thanks len at clare
519417,lobo1,2002-04-20 23:03:00,734,"Len,Just been following along the other ""ice out"" thread. You should have plenty of options where you are at - plus the water is moving there - no problem with the ice.We've got the fever pretty bad here. Went out on the Tittabawasee the other day and got a couple nice eyes and a nice small mouth C&R). Had one fish bout steal my rod - darn thing got himself into a snag and I couldn't get him or the snag out. Of coarse we were sucker fishing......... but it took the edge off. Didn't catch any suckers. The suckers are hitting on pieces of sponge sprayed with WD-40 !! Darn if all we brought was crawlers !Steve"
519421,mlost2,2002-04-22 15:01:00,1,"mlost2I have an ice prediction on ice out...I was talking to my employee up there, it seems like about five days on average size lakes. The larger ones 3x3 miles or more ten days. Good luck on the walleye fishing!"
519418,lobo1,2002-05-11 13:06:00,734,"Len, I have to retract my last statement - my guy called today to say there is still a foot and half of ice and I am also on a river system. He said it looks good in the Pickle Lake area but I don't think we want to fly to his camps in that area.good luck,steve"
519419,Guest,2002-05-13 06:18:00,0,Good to hear from you Steve.How far north of the town of Pickle Lake would you be. I think we will be 70-90 miles north.They are talking ice conditions on another canadian fishing forum do you have that one Steve???Maybe I can e-mail it to you.[email protected]
519420,lobo1,2002-05-13 07:00:00,734,we're about 100 miles north and 80 to the east of Pickle. The outfitter will be up there and will be calling with daily updates starting this thursday. They have an airstrip up there at the village they are using for their float plane hub.It will be close - we're 10 days out and we'll need to know something in probably 8 days to make a decision. Don't want to drive to T-Bay and have to change plans at that point. If we don't hear definate yes by next Tuesday we'll probably vote on going in the fall. I think he has an opening on the Pipestone system but we will have to vote on it and I know a couple of the guys are pressed for time. If we go on the Pipestone it will add 3 days to our trip.we'll see....still cold here so I am not all that optimistic.lobo
