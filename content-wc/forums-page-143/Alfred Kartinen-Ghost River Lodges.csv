6245730,wmd,2018-09-17 09:18:00,388,I returned from Ghost River on Friday. Alfred passed away from cancer last week in Sioux Lookout. He and his wife Donna ran the lodge for many years before Darrel and Tena bought it from them. I only met Alfred a couple of times and did not know him well but seemed to me to be a very nice man. Thought those that knew Alfred would like to know. wmd
