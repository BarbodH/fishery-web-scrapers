They are a very professional air service from the weigh in on the ground to the professionalism of the pilots, they are a top notch operation! Let me start by saying that Jason and Sue Booth, the owners of BFO, are two of the most genuine people you will meet. They are a hard working couple that have plans for some nice upgrades to their two ouposts on Melchett and Kayedon Lakes. The day we flew out Jason had flown into Kayedon to install a solar fridge which Sue had informed us was the first one in the Nakina area.They have plans for a new roof, water tank and hot and cold water to the sink at Melchett. They have already done those upgrades at Kayedon as well as new LED solar lighting and new docks at both camps. Melchett Outpost - It is obvious that the previous owner of the camp had not done many improvements for some time. That being said, the camp was adequately comfortable for our stay. The kitchen was well supplied with the necessary pots, pans and utensils. Propane stove and two propane fridges. One worked marginally and the other was too cold but we managed fine. There was a gas grille and fish cooker on the deck outside. The bedroom area is small but functional for our group. I think the camp can support up to six people comfortably. The shower worked fine but could use some improvement. The screened in porch is a great bonus with a great view of the lake. The outhouses were in good shape and clean with little odor. There were no bugs to speak of. The walk up to the cabin from the dock can be a little treacherous for some of us older guys especially when it's wet. I mentioned it to Sue and she said stairs are in the future plans. Boats and Motors - There are 5 boats and motors at the camp. Mercury 2 cycle 9.9hp motors and a mixture of Naden and Lund 14' boats. All of which are pretty tired. The two boats we used did not leak. One of the motors would only run at about half power on our last day and since we were about halfway down the lake when it happened we just stayed out and fished the rest of the day with it. We ended up being towed in by the other boat as it would only do about 6 mph on the way in. Fishing - The fishing was phenomenal. The first day turned into a windy blustery day after we flew in so we fished the bay by the camp and did pretty well considering the conditions. The first fish of the trip was a nice 23"" walleye caught on a bouncer. Most of our big fish were caught near the camp with the exception of a 25""er I caught at the far end of the lake. Bottom bouncers with spinner rigs and crawlers accounted for most of our fish as we had several windy days during our stay although a jig and a Berkley Uncle Rico Ripple Shad accounted for a 26"" walleye, our biggest. An area at the far southwest end of the lake called The Wall accounted for most of our fish. The fish were holding on a break at about 22-25 fow. Backtrolling or drifting with the heavy winds and jockeying the boat from 22-30 fow along the break line produced well. There were areas that we caught fish as shallow as 8' but it was obvious they preferred the deeper water. We had 62-63 degree surface temp throughout the week. All told we caught over 1100 fish for the week with the bigs being 26, 25.5,25, 2-24's 3-23's and many in the 18-21"" range. All year classes were caught from one that was barely 5"" long to the 26""er. Melchett has a very healthy walleye population. Our biggest pike was a 32'er caught by my nephew. I had good intentions to do some serious pike fishing but never did. Pike mybe accounted for 1% of our catch. In conclusion, I would put Melchett Lake as a definite go to lake for numbers of walleye with a good chance at a trophy. The rates are very attractive. I think Boreal Forest Outfitters are going to do their best to do some much needed upgrades to the camps as time and funds permit. As a post script, we stayed at Jason and Sues rental property in Nakina the night before we flew in. It is a three bedroom house with a full kitchen that was very comfortable and at $35 CDN very reasonable. There are very few options in Nakina to stay. BTW, they informed us that the cabin that Nakina Air Service rents out will no longer be available next year. All in all, we had a great trip to Melchett Lake with Boreal Forest Outfitters."

Our best day we boated 270 fish between 2 boats!Quote: Originally Posted by vteye3Bstar glad you had a great trip - I've met Sue & Jason couple times, nice folks and happy to hear about the camp upgrades.vteye, Thanks! Jason and Sue are really nice people. It's good to see that young exuberance in camp owners. And their little girl, Caitlyn, is too cute!"

6245080,Bstar,2018-09-15 12:32:00,564,You're welcome! You're not the Remi that used to own the camp are you?
6245574,chris.brock,2018-09-16 19:49:00,112,"A good report. As for all the minor complaints, you've gotta remember all this stuff is flown in, planes are expensive, there's no caretaker, the nearest Home Depot is isn't down the street. You said the fishing was phenomenal, I'd be more than satisfied."
6245620,Bstar,2018-09-17 04:42:00,564,"Chris, I agree and we were more than satisfied. Just wanted to paint a picture of the camp. We had a great time and Sue and Jason are awesome camp owners. I would not hesitate to go back to Melchett Lake with Boreal Forest Outfitters. Brian"
