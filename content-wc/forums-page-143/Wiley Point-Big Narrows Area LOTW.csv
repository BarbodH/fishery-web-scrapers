6241116,martinbns,2018-09-04 16:53:00,1520,Yep
6241158,patrick,2018-09-04 19:09:00,277,Where do you guys put in at when you go to Wiley's
6241204,martinbns,2018-09-04 22:00:00,1520,Kenora would probably be easiest. Wylie Point probably can arrange parking for your truck and trailer.
6241230,patrick,2018-09-05 05:32:00,277,OK thanks
6241244,eyeman_1,2018-09-05 06:11:00,690,"Patrick,Wiley is part of the Totem Lodges Resorts. They are in Sioux Narrows. I have taken my boat with them several times. They have ample room for trucks and trailers at Totem, where you would launch. It is about a 50 min boat ride to Wiley from Totem.Hope you go, you will enjoy Wiley and the fishing is very good."

We have been down in the spring and fish are usually concentrated along shorelines, so haven't fished much off shore in that area. Looks like there are some nicer humps towards the Barrier islands and looks like the Big Narrows area may be a good place to get out of a stronger North wind? We will be mainly concentrating on Walleye, but will likely throw for a musky and some smallmouth as well. Not sure if there are any concentrations of Fall Crappie down in this part of the lake either. Thanks for any feedback you can give me. Can't wait. MrPike24"
6233388,martinbns,2018-08-14 16:09:00,1520,"We fish that area a lot, tons of humps the walleye congregate on. Lately we have been finding them in 25-30 feet of water. Lots of nice islands to hunt Smallmouth and Musky as well. Where are you staying?"
6233538,mrpike24,2018-08-14 21:09:00,54,Wiley point. Pm sent. Thanks!
6233624,MN_Moose,2018-08-15 06:12:00,964,Mark me down as jealous. Take me with you? Jk I'll send you an email with my spots down that way. Would like to hear your report on staying at WB.
6233680,martinbns,2018-08-15 07:02:00,1520,"Make sure you have a club sandwich while you are there, it's the best one I have ever eaten."
6233758,eyeman_1,2018-08-15 09:15:00,690,"Their shore lunch is pretty good as well, and the food overall is amazing. Oh yeah... the fishing is pretty fair too..."
6234438,AMPHIB206,2018-08-16 21:10:00,191,Oh ya. They're a meal; along with a Wiley Point caesar.
6234486,eyeman_1,2018-08-17 06:11:00,690,Living is good there for sure!
6234512,nicko,2018-08-17 07:44:00,508,"We were at Wiley 8/5-11. Water temps cooled a bit and when we arrived were 68. warmed to low 70-74. Algae bloom hit everywhere S-SE. Big Narrows and everywhere down there was very green. Had no luck down there. We concentrated N-NW/NE and had no trouble getting walleye on mid-lake humps and reefs. Lots of 10-14"" fish but when you find bigger they are there. Biggest of week was 26. We usually had shore lunch caught by 9-9:30. SM were on fire in rocks and boulders. Early evenings after the MONSTER wiley dinner we hit a few local spots and got bit by everything. Boated 2 muskie 40-42 and had several follows. Enjoy......"
