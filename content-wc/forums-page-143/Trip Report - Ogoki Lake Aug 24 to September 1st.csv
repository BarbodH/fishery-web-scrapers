6241342,gordy28,2018-09-05 11:27:00,437,We are not long back from our week on Ogoki Lake After two trips to the Algoma region our group decided to head further North (and west) to try a trip of out Nakina with John and Gloria Ritch at Ogoki Lake Outfittershttp://www.ogokilakeoutfitters.com/ We had an amazing trip - fishing was great even with a major front moving in mid week and battling some really rough water Can't say enough about Ogoki as a body of water and John And Gloria as outfitters and their cabins location and set up Ogoki is certainly one of the first lakes we have fished where we said to a man I would have no problem going back to (Although my gut says we will try a new lake next trip purely because the adventure of a new lake is still really fresh to us with this being our 5th trip) I did a much writer write up here with pictures - no matter what I cannot seem to do a clean cut and paste.https://www.canadafishingguide.net/f...ki-lake/#p4977 Thanks to all of the help from those on this forum - many PM's or answers in my threads during the search were greatly appreciated Cheers Gordy

6241532,wantabigone,2018-09-05 18:38:00,39,"Great write up Gordy, thanks for taking the time. I was eager to see your report as I have not fished the lake in July or August. The water levels looked to be way down from when I have been there.It sounds like you had a great trip. Too bad you didn't get some windless days to allow better boat control and less body hits. Love that lake-so much area to explore. As Brock said-there has to be some huge pike in there. John and Gloria are great owners."
