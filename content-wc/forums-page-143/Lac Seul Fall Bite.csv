Looking at how the fishing has been this year and what I dealt with earlier this year, the low water and weather is definitely effected fishing not bad just different. With the date I would think pressure would be down and the fall feedbags coming on. Just wondering if anyone could give insite as to mid September fishing. I would only be running up for 3 days of fishing which I know is short and puts things at risk with weather but just wanted to get some feedback. Location would be launching in Hudson and fishing lost lake all the way upto bear narrows."

Best advice I can give you is large red tail or rainbow dace chubs, sliver or gold strobe jigs or chartreuse jigs. 18 to 30' structure. Mostly a vertical presentation once we find fish. We always hope to see water temps in the low to mid 50's as the cooler the water, the better the fishing has been our experience. We don't get south of Bear Narrows too often we usually find the fishing better further North. Good Luck! Milfish"
