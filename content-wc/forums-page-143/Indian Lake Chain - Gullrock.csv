6244120,gullrockguy,2018-09-12 20:54:00,44,"i used to troll with spinners all the time and it was always a hard fish in the fall, now i look at my depth finder and if i mark fish i jig . but if i;m working a flat area i will troll if the jig doesnt work."
6244176,Walleye2242,2018-09-13 06:19:00,263,I have always had great luck with fall fishing on gullrock. we usually go late sept. and love it. Usually look for 20-24ft of water of humps and points of course. I have fished gullrock so many times that i have my 5 to 10 spots that are my go too's. I will anchor up and jig are jig while floating with the wind. rarely troll a spinner but will at times. usual stuff.
