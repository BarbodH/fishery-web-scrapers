6236808,skirkpat,2018-08-23 14:57:00,12,"Had a great trip earlier this month. Fished Sabaskong/Miles bay. Walleye fishing seemed good (jig/minnow) but no bigguns. Lots of dinks and plenty of 14-17"" every morning to feed 6 every day at shore lunch. We only kept enough to eat and ensured none went to waste.Miles Bay had a huge algae bloom and was like pea soup. Still caught a few in there when the wind wasn't blowing too hard. Did not go into Obabikon Lake and didn't fish around the infamous Obabikon brush piles (like local guides apparently do....ha). Must say the camp looks absolutely beautiful though.We casted in late afternoon and several evenings. Had a 30"" musky and a couple big northern (35""+). Casted mostly silver minnow weedless spoons or some type of daredevil/jitterbug type spoon. Several questions for those that have fished the area...what is the best way to find numbers for northerns in early August? Decades ago we caught lots of 'snot rockets' but not so much this year. And what is best way to find bigger pike...are they deeper than casting to shorelines/weedy bays and does anyone troll LOTW for them? Second question....I fished LOTW decades ago. My memory is not good.....I was VERY pleased with walleye fishing this year but the size seems smaller (again lots of 14-17"" but nada over 20""). We were primarily catching walleye in 18-26 feet of water on the side of underwater reef humps. Has netting on the LOTW in sabaskong/miles area had an impact on average walleye size over the last ten years? Or more likely, is it my angling skills? Final question: I fished the south and west sides of Horseshoe island in Miles Bay in search of the BIG musky (throwing bucktails and cowgirls). No luck but area looks GREAT. On the east-side of Horseshoe, per map, there is a small channel/opening leading into a lake within island. Looks like it would be larger than a football field (kind of like turtle lake but smaller and smaller entry). I could not find the channel when boating by....does it overgrown with weeds or is it accessible by boat? And anyone ever fish in there?Had a great time and definitely going back as soon as I can!"
6236860,Obabikon,2018-08-23 17:34:00,2370,"Typically... the numbers of pike are in Stoney or Obabikon Lake. However, this July was so incredibly hot, all the pike had moved deep. It was tough to catch more than a handful in the afternoon. I don't think there's a ""trick"" to it, unless you can prevent 8-10 days of 90+ degrees in July."
6236876,BreezyPoint,2018-08-23 17:54:00,1581,"Always found pike fishing more difficult in late summer. They go deep and we have caught nice ones jigging in 20 fow. When it's cloudy they may move up into the shallows. Pike are a cool water fish and don't tolerate warm waters much unless they are feeding. On our July trip, we had a tough time catching eater size walleyes. We caught some hogs (up to 28.5), but walleye fishing overall was difficult.Frank"
6236938,muskyman73,2018-08-23 21:19:00,401,"There is a channel right there at the cat-tails on the island, trim up and use your electric motor and based off water level, you can go right in. That side of the island has the football field full of vw bug sized boulders and reefs. Its usually pretty good for at least a musky or two and tons of smallies. But this year it was not. Burrow Bay tends to hold some nice sized muskies, it's pretty much a given, just gettin them to move is another."
6237074,skirkpat,2018-08-24 09:01:00,12,"Love reading the replies, thanks all. This is such a beautiful area I already want to be back there trying more stuff. Glad to hear the big walleyes are there, Breezy. Had to laugh as it clearly is my fishing skills (which I suspected!) for not landing the bigguns but caught plenty and had a great time doing it. How much fun for you to struggle to catch eater-size because the 20+ inchers (28.5!) end up in your net instead. One things I was wondering....I typically fish Jig/minnow and just use the small version of the minnow (when selecting between small/medium/large at a bait store). Now I will have to bite the bullet and spend more $ to experiment with medium or large minnows to see if that makes any difference on walleye size. Also loved to hear the story of going through the inlet into the Horsehoe island bay. I will definitely have to try it. I didn't get close enough to see as I was leery of the big rocks mentioned around the east side. They showed up on the Navionics app and I wasn't real familiar with this area so opted to be safe. Couple more stories....one fisherman in boat caught a really big crappie jigging for walleye near blueberry island. I think it came out of 25-30 feet and was hooked in the paper-mouth for easy release. Took a quick pic and went to release but he couldn't swim down. I believe the air-sac was ruined much like a scuba diver with the bends. As hopeful as we were an eagle soared down and lunch was served. Are crappie sensitive to air-sac issues when caught? Looking for advice on what to do in this situation (other than not fish that deep although I really thought we were less than 30- feet). Had the eagle not feasted I planned to filet the crappie if he wouldn't revive - although not my optimum solution. We did cast some in Burrow Bay with no luck...but didn't hit it hard. Biggest musky I ever saw (not mine) came out of Stevens Bay @ 53"". I am amazed (and admire) the amount of fisherman that flog musky 24/7. I love doing it but have to take some some jigging 'breaks' in between. Almost becomes an addiction tho, ha. There is so much water to explore and at any point in time, you can look around and think 'that shoreline over there looks like it may have some musky' or 'the map shows a reef over there we should try fishing' etc. Finally - Obabikon - I have never stayed at a boat-in - but your camp looks extremely nice so thought you and others should hear it - and especially because it seems like out every window would be a prime fishing spot! Did I say I was ready to go back?"
6237216,BreezyPoint,2018-08-24 13:43:00,1581,We actually had a tough time for walleyes. Sort of accidentally caught all of the big ones where one would never fish for walleyes! Maybe that is the secret for this year.Frank
6237254,That Minnesota guy,2018-08-24 14:42:00,8293,"I'm far from a Pike expert but I always like to find a underwater point and troll across it. WARNING...this will get expensive. Pulling/bouncing deep running cranks across a rock covered point you are bound to hang up and lose a few. However, if you can bounce over the top and the Pike are there you are almost guaranteed they will smoke your bait on the backside of that point."
6237302,Bill Krejca,2018-08-24 16:01:00,6107,"Skirk - A revisit of the subject - At the risk of again being considered a complete idiot by some, I will respond to your query re: crappie float. Through more than a few years of experiencing a situation where a fish (usually a crappie, in my experience) will not return to deep water, I found that almost all will give a quick tail wave and disappear down if the catcher will just flip the fish about 6 feet into the air during release. This seems to shock them enough that the depth change effects somehow are overcome by the shock of hitting the water. I have even picked up fish which did not achieve quite enough ""altitude"" and then thrown them again, and have them head for the bottom. This does not seem to work, if the stomach is observed as extending almost to the point of coming out of the mouth - these fish should be kept for eating, but does work very well, normally in depths of 18 -24 feet, on most days. For those who are skeptical of this procedure, please give it a try next time you have a chance, rather than reply words to the effect that the bottom is littered with dead crappies. My belief is that crappie caught below 18 feet through the ice should probably all be kept, as they will not make it. There are a number of fish stocking videos with the fish being dropped from moving airplanes, the stock plane being a lot higher than 6 feet off the surface of the water. Bill"
6244580,Hook_settr,2018-09-14 04:25:00,127,We are headed to Mylie's next weekend and I am hoping to get lots of practice with these methods of releasing crappies!
6244602,raiderone,2018-09-14 06:40:00,4,Any reports on the crappie bite at the Elbow? Thanks heading up next week..
6245036,Obabikon,2018-09-15 09:23:00,2370,"One day will be very good, and the next day none existent. However, they are certainly ""in there"". Just depends on the bite."
6245174,Bill Krejca,2018-09-15 17:28:00,6107,"Gotta follow the wind. If they are found, check out the wind, and they many times will be again in the same general area. If they do not bite when found, try either putting the bait a little deeper or shallower. if no wind, they sometimes move deeper. Bill"
6245280,Obabikon,2018-09-16 06:02:00,2370,"I completely agree with everything Bill said. However, there are days when you see the enormous schools, and you do everything you can to catch them... This has been a very strange year for bites. Walleye and crappie both have just flat out refused to cooperate at certain times. Changing techniques is incredibly key though! Have an awesome trip!"
6237466,steve.a,2018-08-25 06:24:00,274,I first saw people spinning crappie by the lower lip at Nestor Falls off the dock when they come from deep water. I thought that they were just amusing themselves but all the fish swam away. Just hold lower lip and flip them about 5 feet up and away. Crappie only (pike hard on thumb)
6244278,Rather Be Lucky,2018-09-13 09:19:00,256,"It has been my experience with deep caught crappies that if caught at <25' the chance of live release is good if I do a few things.. First pull them up slow, I then cradle the fish in my hand under the belly closing the gills and close the mouth with my index finger holding it closed while at the same time give the fish a gentle squeeze for a count of 5.. (the bigger fish takes both hands) You will see a few small bubbles come out as you squeeze.. then flip (a little aggressively) into the water. I do this with all the crappies I want to release in the fall. (they even last longer in the livewell this way) When catching >25', the percentage goes down and if catching 30'+ the fish are YOURS. When releasing the fish and before leaving the area, if any come back up I will net them for supper!!! Some times the eagles get a few.. neat to see but not what I want to do. They can get their own. My son and I started doing this 25 yrs ago when he said ""Dad it looks like they have lock-jaw"" (We did note that most if not all fish were floating with their mouths wide open) We netted and closed the mouths and it worked.. after that we came up with this method and has worked very well. Wife and I have been fishing Nestor Falls for 20+years @Helliars.. (Sadly missed the last 2.. will be back soon.) It really irritates me when I see people just throwing fish back and leaving them floating. That is not catch and release... that is a total disregard for a resource. Have shown this method to many other fisher people and their results have been good. Swede"
