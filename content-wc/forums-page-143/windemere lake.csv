The outpost camp at far end of lake was much better than main camp for all fish, killed walleye there a couple of times a few hundred yards from cabin. The portage behind cabin was very good also for walleye, and we got into a smally feeding frenzy one day. Hope this helps."

I'm booked in early july and hope the smallies are still hungry. thanks again, pinenut"

I will also say they can be caught just about anywhere, including those bruisers, however I think overall the bigger fish seem to be mid lake and west. Caught some super nice fish close to lodge too, but that's just how it goes.Read your post on MLO and Attwood Lake. Spot on. Just returned from there yesterday and spent week before that at HDL. Super great time at both."
6241956,kzoofisher,2018-09-07 03:35:00,5144,"Agree with 3M about the fish getting larger. Was there last week and the 15""-20"" fish were noticeably fatter than in previous years. There was also more weed growth in many areas of the lake and more minnows in the shallows/coughed up by fish; I believe the invasive rusty crayfish explosion has ended and the collapse back to a stable population begun. We caught fewer smallmouth than past years, still quite a few when we targeted them, and they were bigger, too. Mostly cookie cutter fat 15""-16"" with some 17s and 18s thrown in. One 19"" and one 20"" were also caught. Biggest 'eye of the trip was 27"" caught in Nicholson Bay. I don't think you need to go further west than that for fish and a report I got from early August included many, many fish near the lodge. I've always heard that earlier in the season there are more fish east than west. The portage lakes are a nice day trip if you choose to head west. It's about a 40 minute run to the outpost at 15mph, much less in a boat that isn't heavily loaded. Be sure to lay down a good track so you can find your way back if the weather turns. The rental boats don't have sonar that will do that so you'll need some sort of portable gps. Paper maps of the lake are available but not much help if you can't see."
6241964,pinenut,2018-09-07 05:23:00,16,"thanks for the updates, we'll naturally try the lodge end but I think we can make the run to mid or west end of lake early enough in the a.m. to get into the walleye if that's their hangout. we're renting a boat with 25hp, troller, and graph.(not real sure how to use one) I'm comparing my travel time on this lake to wabatongushi lake, its 21mls long and we could cover it fairly easy with a 9.9hp. we traveled end to end on an open day while sight seeing. the fishing was slow, we blamed the mayfly hatch. looking forward to catching smallies, all the fly-in lakes we have fished were too far north for them. thanks again, pinenut"
