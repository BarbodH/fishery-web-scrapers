6240384,Golden Eagle,2018-09-02 14:40:00,2642,"I believe you are going in 9/22, rather than 8/22. Unless you're thinking 2019.The photos on this thread show pike much smaller than the usual catch. If you don't boat nice pike it won't be the fault of the lake. Lake level has been low all season and big pike are easily spooked. Ease up on them and don't bang on the boat. Big fish didn't grow to that size by being dumb. They've learned that being easily spooked has allowed them to live a long, undisturbed life.Count on catching plenty of small to medium walleyes unless you experience severeweather conditions.You'll probably be in camp with bow hunters. Those guys can go mean and nasty ifa fisherman spooks their bull as they're about to fire an arrow. Find out where they'll be each morning and evening, then fish elsewhere. Humps, away from shoreline, will treat you well. Hunters will be mostly in bays. Plenty of room for a couple of bow hunters and a few fishermen.You'll wish you had booked 7 days instead of 5. Not too late to change. If you sit this one out you'll be making a monumental blunder."
6240430,gullrockguy,2018-09-02 18:18:00,44,"gee, Mr Golden Eagle, since you are virtually a resident at this camp, maybe you should mark up a map for the Wolf party and give them your hot spots. Hope you have a great winter Connie, looks like i'm moving to winnipeg and won't be fishing the bug river big girls in the spring. ( at least this is what the wife is telling me) sure hope she's wrong."
6240442,Golden Eagle,2018-09-02 19:02:00,2642,You picked Winnipeg over Tennessee? You'd make a great hillbilly. Come on down. Won't be the same without chair footprints in the sand along the bug at ice out. Sand needs cigar ashes.
6241544,5richards,2018-09-05 19:08:00,131,Golden eagle is an institution at Little Vermilion -- I've fished there several years and it is the very best pike lake for your dollar that you can find. Brett is a great guy and will put you on fish. You will be able to catch all the walleye eaters you want --- you will easily catch you largest pike --- or more. pm me if you want more info
6241546,5richards,2018-09-05 19:10:00,131,It's Rocky -- Hope you are well and all the guys we fished with!
6241712,maddogg,2018-09-06 08:58:00,178,I'm pretty sure it is illegal to use any game-fish in whole or part for bait in Ontario.
6242408,spoonchucker,2018-09-08 10:44:00,82,Thinking about Warrington outpost from this lodge- have 12 guys who are pike fisherman- any thoughts/
6239232,eyemike,2018-08-29 19:57:00,233,"My wife and I spent a week at Sportsman's Lodge Aug. 11 to Aug. 18.Brett and Judy Geary are fantastic host! I have posted on the Sportsman's Lodge in the past and Golden Eagle is a fixture there. We arrived to 90+ degree temps that made it difficult to be in the boat! Even so I managed a pig 44"" pike! Three days of heat and or wind from just about every direction! The temps dropped to 55 degrees! What a drastic change! We had a good week with some great hosts!"
6239310,Whopper,2018-08-30 06:09:00,340,"Some nice pike. I have to agree with you eyemike about Sportsmans, the Geary's are good people and it's a great place to spend the week fishing. Golden Eagle took me under his wing about thirteen years ago and I've made the walleye opener a permanent spot on my calendar since. Thanks for sharing"
6239336,jambi,2018-08-30 06:45:00,504,We did a layover here in 2017 waiting out a thunderstorm on our way back to Showalter's base. Really nice camp. Can't wait to fish here in the future.
6239582,fishin10,2018-08-30 16:43:00,2315,"I was fortunate to be invited by Golden Eagle to be included in his group for opening day up there. The Geary's are great hosts and go out of their way to ensure you have a pleasant stay. All the people I met there were very pleasant. I was fortunate to fish the whole week with Golden Eagle, caught a ton of fish, and learned how to properly handle pike. The ride up from his home in TN was pure joy. Hoping to fish again with him next spring. I would recommend Sportsman's Lodge to everyone."
6239586,fishin10,2018-08-30 16:48:00,2315,A few more
6239588,Golden Eagle,2018-08-30 16:52:00,2642,"Jambi and Eyemike, I hope to be in camp with you guys one of these years. Better hurry though. I'm intending to make a solo this season, but would like a big rain first. Should be a good year for moose hunters due to all the exposed shoreline."
6239626,WallyWarrior,2018-08-30 18:19:00,2488,Tell me about the cut on those walleyes. Never have seen that technique. I cut all of mine but just clip the connection between the gills. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk
6239644,fishin10,2018-08-30 18:35:00,2315,Ask Golden Eagle....I believe it was to bleed them out. He did use a piece of the flesh from the cut on his jig. He out caught me at least 5 to 1 on the Walleyes....3 to 1 on the Pike.
6239702,Pooch,2018-08-31 05:23:00,4618,Golden Eagle? Isn't he that cranky old guy from Tennessee? Pooch
6239712,Bill Krejca,2018-08-31 05:47:00,6107,"Yeah, I noticed the missing flesh also. It is not uncommon to use that piece of a walleye as a sort of pork rind attractant. Affixed to a jig, the meat is extremely tough and will stay on the hook almost a whole day, even after multiple hits/fights. In Saskatchewan, the gullet is (was?)used very regularly as a sort of ""standard super bait"". Bill"
