Boats, motors, and equipment ran flawlessly and fuel was limitless. Weather was different each and every day yet the fish just couldn't keep from 'jumpin' in the boat. Fished all sorts of ways with all sorts of baits and the fish just kept cooperating. Being the only boat on this lake was really special too. Spectacular actually. A special THANKS to Austin Elliot for everything he did. He really hustles and he shared great information without hesitation. A super great guy."
6242590,gordy28,2018-09-09 06:47:00,437,Thanks for the report. Sounds like a great trip. Attwood is on our short list for our next trip. How far did you have to run from camp to find fish? Did you have any really windy days? If so is there fishable water near camp? Weâ€™re the engines 9.9 or 15 hp? If you would rather pm please doCheers Gordy

My nickname is the janitor even though I am not one, I also fished Attwood this past June with MLO and would be willing to share some spots that we had success with. We did stay at Atwood Central though and mainly fished that part of the lake but did venture down to that part of the lake including the Attwood river we did not catch any brook trout but we did catch some northern and walleye. What I wish to find out is what spots were really good around that camp even though that can change the next time around so this is more like a test. I guess my handle is my e-mail? It does state that I am activated. I also want to figure out how to communicate with others through the private message system. I am pretty computer savvy but for some reason cant figure this out. Thanks, janitor"
