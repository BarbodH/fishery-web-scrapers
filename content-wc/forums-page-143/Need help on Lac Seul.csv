6240168,Rodbender351,2018-09-01 18:43:00,8,Normally I fish the central part of lac seul and do very well. Decided to try the north end out of goose bay. Two of us fished 12 hr. caught 5 fish. Is this normal for this part of lac seul? If not what some techniques and depths should we be focusing on? Thanks in advance
6240186,Pooch,2018-09-01 20:13:00,4618,Try running to Steamboat and fish the islands on the north side of that bay towards the east before Shanty area. Did well in that area a month ago. Should still be an area to fish. South or SW wind can make it go.Pooch

Minnow or nightcrawler tipped jigs and spinners with bottom bouncers trolled at .5 mph worked well. Fish seemed to be congregated in some areas, totally absent in other areas where we usually found them. Visiting with other fishermen at the lodge we stayed disclosed a pattern of feast or famine on any given day. Lower water levels and a warmer than normal summer were given as the reason for the fishing conditions we encountered. We fished a lot of spots each day.10-15 minutes, few or no bites, move on. Spent a lot of timr looking for drop-offs and sunken islands."

Fished out of Goosebay for over 20 years and have always caught fish. Talk to Andrea, she will show you where to fish. I've also done well around Cox's island on the north and east side. Also in Steamboat on the south shore. Look for the subtle points and key in on those areas."
