6242700,387loup,2018-09-09 11:59:00,12,We recently fished lakes near Manawaki Quebec for bass and pike. Had a great time with lots of success. Was going to try La Verendrye for a day of walleye and pike but decided against it. We have fished this park many times. I saw that Baskatong was having a walleye tournament on Sept 8. Never fished that water. Any suggestion for pike and walleye there ? Are there free ramps on this reservoir ? The distance seems lots closer from Maniwaki than driving all the way to Le Domaine in La Verendrye park. I welcome any comments/ suggestions.
