I've had more than one go around with a guide and let me say they, the guides, are lower than dirt. They have no self respect and will talk to you like you are a piece of dog crap. I've had a couple offer to meet me on shore to settle the dispute. How can you have 1000's of miles of water and have to go sit on top of another boat!!! You are a guide for goodness sake. Your only job is to find fish, surely you can find fish in unoccupied places. I could care less if they offered me a month longth all expenses paid trip, I would rather stay at home than go to that worthlessly run camp. THe owners have no shame and have been informed about their guides numerous times yet they allow it to continue. Leadership and integrity starts at the top and the folks at Anderson's don't have either."
1901002,Guest,2013-06-26 21:17:00,0,i'm surprised that no one has mention about the quest at aderson's that were stranded in unxpected for two nights before anyone from camp found them on the island......but then again they are only on their 4th manager this season so far.....
1901810,Mike Kansas,2013-06-27 07:36:00,1463,"Are you sure you are talking about Andersons at Manitou Falls, English River or the Andersons that fishs Lac Seul?"
1902082,tomt,2013-06-27 08:38:00,4,"Thanks for all the replies- both good and bad! I'm talking about the Andersons that fishes Lac Seul. Maybe I posted on the wrong thread? I didn't realize there were different Andersons lodges. I realize that everyone's experiences will be different some I'm going with an open mind but also with my eyes open. I've been taking my boys to Canada since they've been 8yrs old (they're now 23, 21 and 16) but this is our first trip back in a few years mainly because my oldest was a combat Marine in the Corps and we've been waiting for him to be discharged. Usually did fly-in trips to northern Saskatchewan for big pike so this is our first drive-in trip. We're from the SW suburbs of Chicago.I've sent an email to Anderson's with a link to this post figuring they would be interested. We'll see what their response is. Nevertheless we're planning on having a great trip and will post a report when we get home"
1903946,Ranger319,2013-06-27 20:32:00,166,"Time to man up, I was wrong. I'm sure that the Anderson's that mike is referring too is a fine opperation. My apologies to them. I am talking about the andersons in sioux lookout. I saw andersons and it struck a nerve. Good luck getting an honest answer from sioux lookout anderson's. IF they come here they will no doubt deny that it happened... Hope ya slay em Mike!!!"
1905034,tomt,2013-06-28 08:46:00,4,Let me just say I pity the guide if he ever acts like that with us. I'm traveling that far and paying that kind of money and then to be treated like crap? He will have one badass Marine to deal with if thats the case. Nuff said.

2340906,Yaktumsqueegie,2014-01-11 03:37:00,17,"Good fishing, bad camp. Was there in 2012. Dirty cabin, bad motor, bad boat. I have heard the motors have improved. the owner is absent and it shows. It appears 2013 was similar to my experience. If you go get ready to clean a cabin when you get there, but take a stringer cause you will need it."
2372161,elkman99,2014-01-21 18:02:00,180,how is the musky fishing on that chain of lakes when staying at Manitou Falls Camp? Is this the only camp/cabins available in the area?
2372289,BreezyPoint,2014-01-21 18:30:00,1581,"I fished that area the last two years. In that time, I saw only one muskie (it was a giant). There are muskies there and some big ones, but I wouldn't go back there to fish them. Too far between fish. I would go some place like Lake of the Woods if I were targeting muskie.I went through a fly-in operator who has an outpost on Unexpected Lake.http://www.canadaoutfitters.comI had a great time both trips...caught great walleyes and northerns and really love the area and would go back in a heartbeat, just not to fish musky (which I worked very hard at). Lake of the Woods is my go to place for my annual musky trip."
1536187,Mike Kansas,2013-02-11 10:27:00,1463,Anybody ever fished here? If so how was fishing?
1536230,jiggster,2013-02-11 12:40:00,183,"I have been fishing out of Andersons for the past 12 years. The English River system is one of the best systems I have fished. You can fish new waters every day if you want. You have 7 lakes of the system. You can fish for walleye, northern, bass, musky, white fish. Send me a P.M. and I could put you on fish immediately. You would not have to waste time looking for the best areas. You can not go wrong with the fishing. When are you thinking of going?"
1536351,Guest,2013-02-11 17:32:00,0,good fishing..... BAD accommodation
1536583,DanM57,2013-02-12 09:21:00,135,Our group has been going to Manitou Falls Camp for close to 40 years. We go the 1st week in June and the fishing is typically outstanding.
1536853,HuskerFrank,2013-02-12 19:05:00,24,"My very experienced group of anglers booked Anderson's for the first time last year. We're never going back, and it's not because of the fishing. That's all I'll say here, but but feel free to PM me if you want specifics."
1899322,tomt,2013-06-26 11:28:00,4,heading up to Anderson's next week (main lodge)for the first time with my three sons. was wondering if anyone had any clues on what the negatives are that are being referenced. PM me if you wish. Thanks!
1899362,Aaron-IN,2013-06-26 11:44:00,500,"The nice thing about this public forum is to share experiances at different outfits/lodges, etc, why take it off line with a PM? Share your experiances and tell us why it sucked."
1899562,tomt,2013-06-26 12:42:00,4,I agree Aaron....they've got me a little worried but other than those couple of posts have read good things about this lodge. Well hopefully everything works out for us!

1899698,jigfisher9,2013-06-26 13:31:00,23,"Tom T., My dad and I have been going to Anderson's Manitou Falls since '94 and we have brought three different groups of guys up there with us over the last 18 years. Each of those 3 groups have since split off from our group ( not because we're jerks, just other circumstances) and they continue to go to Anderson's, just not the same week we go. So it is very common for this camp to see repeat business as you can tell by other posters who have been going for 12 years and 40 years. Fishing is great, the camp boats are adequate, but not high end, the accommodations are adequate, but not great, The docks are adequate but not great. The help is sometimes the wild card, as with any business it comes down to how well they service their customer. We have never had a bad week in camp, some years the help is above average and other years it is just ok.My selling points are: This is a nice camp that you can drive right up to the cabin. the cabins are clean, the beds are Ok, the kitchens are small, the showers are ok, the fish cleaning house is not the prettiest place to clean fish, but this is the North Wood and not the Marriott. The lakes are large enough that you will likely see 1-2 boats all day, if the wind comes up you can still see shoreline so you don't feel like you are in the middle of lake Michigan. The current of the river flows thru each lake which gives you known points and humps to find fish. The weather does not affect your fishing as much as on the big lakes. You dont have to figure out which way the wind is blowing to find Walleye. Close enough to Ear Falls to drive in and get supplies if you run out or need help. But #1 selling point is the fishing is outstanding. It is not uncommon to put 75-100 fish in the boat in a day, and usually 3 species. It is all relative to what your past experience has been fishing and taking vacations. For the best customer service you cant beat Mexico, for the best night life you can't beat Nashville or Vegas, for the best beaches you cant beat Hawaii and for the best fishing you can't beat Northwest Ontario.Go into it with an open mind and just enjoy the time you get with your 3 sons. I would not trade the one week of fishing with my dad for anything in the world and can not wait for my son to get old enough to go with me."
