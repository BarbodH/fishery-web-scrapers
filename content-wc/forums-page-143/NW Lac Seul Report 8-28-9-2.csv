We have made more than 10 trips to Gawley's, and as usual they were great hosts with great facilities. As mentioned by others, the water was down between 16 inches and a foot. Water temps mid/low sixties, which seemed about 5 degrees or so cooler than usual for this time. Weather was pretty variable, but overall less wind than we have had in the past, daytime temps mostly 60's and low 70's, nighttime temps 40's and low 50's. The water seemed a little cloudier than usual, but we got some rain that they really needed and it did clear by week's end. Fishing was good but not as good as we have previously had. I think we averaged around 40 fish a day with 2 boats fishing, and normally we are twice that. Lots of overs, biggest 26 1/2. Several smallmouth with the biggest 17 1/2. More pike than usual with a few in the upper 30"" range. Mostly jig fishing with minnow or 1/2 crawler, and it didn't seem to make a lot of difference which bait or jig color we used. Fish came from 10-27 feet. We did get some fish trolling cranks too. Don't know if it was the lower water, but some of our usual spots were not as good as they usually are, and we never really found a steady bite, we had to either keep moving and picking up a few quick fish, or stay on a slower bite. Fished mostly McKenzie Bay, but we did fish Steamboat Bay when the winds kept us from going further. Fire bans lifted during our stay due to some rainfall, several islands were smoking when we arrived, but all seemed to be out when we left. Fire damage is very visible on the east and southeast sides of Steamboat Island. Didn't see any wildlife this trip other than a few eagles. Always a great trip, and we're rebooked for next year."

Biggest fish was 27 and lots of fish between 22 and 25 all week. Covered a lot of water drifting and trolling to find fish. Good trip for us as well, might try one week later in September next year just for the heck of it. Saw two moose come to the water for a drink as a bonus."
