""Gracie"" turned one today...........many of you have seen her on the front of our boat on the lake in the past 7 weeks. We lost our Bandit 2 years ago and never thought we would have another dog. Too painful. Last year while at Gull Rock our Gracie was born on Canada Day and so today we had a big party at Mary's on South Bay............ So Canada Day is a pretty 'dog gone"" special day in more ways than one............Happy Canada Day. Sorry about the sappy part."
