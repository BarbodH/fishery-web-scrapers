1197251,Ogoki,2010-05-06 05:38:00,291,"I have been on 33 fly-in trips and the past 11 years we have used Mattice Lake Outfitters exclusively !!MLO have to be among the best if not the best outfitter !!!!! I travel from Ohio thru the Soo to Armstrong. The others told you some shops that are along the way . As far as MUST SEE places ,just east of Rossport there is a pull of spot along Lake Superior with some picnic tables . Just before getting there you will see a salt storage building on the north side of the road , that way you know ou are close . STOP there and SOAK IN the FANTASTIC view of Lake Superior !!! Just a ways up the road ,past Nipigon drive back to Ouimet Canyon . BE CARFUL there but the view is GREAT . There you will see a deep canyon that is different from anything you will see here in Ohio . We have made that trip and average of 2 times a summer the past 21 years ."
1197262,deputy dog,2010-05-06 06:31:00,305,"thanks for all the great info! keep it comin ogoki, have you fished whitewater? any info you're willing to share? how liberal are they on weight for the planes? have heard sooo many positives about don and annette and the operation they run."
1197371,Stauff,2010-05-06 11:14:00,110,"We've always driven straight through (ugh!) from Cincinnati, so I've rarely been able to talk any of the other group members into a sight-seeing adventure along the way - don't make that mistake! You're traveling through some of the most beautiful country you will see anywhere. Thunder Bay is definitely the last stop if you need to purchase ANY supplies. Ogoki Reservoir is our lake of choice, but Donn, Annette or any of the other crew members can fill you in on Whitewater with up to date info once you get there - just have them mark your map and you're set. Regarding road construction - call Don. They just got back from Niagra Falls so he probably has a good idea of any areas to avoid. Enjoy the trip - there's nothing else like it!"
1197563,Ogoki,2010-05-07 05:04:00,291,"Deputy Dog , I have not fished Whitewater . Would really like to some year at ice out though. The lakes that I have fished noth of Armstrong are : Whiteclay, Ogoki Reservoir (both of those lakes numerous times) , Mojikit, Attwood, Hurst , Bellsmith ,Auger , Souter , Wabakimi, Smoothrock, Granite and a few other smaller ones. Lake of Choice is Ogoki Reservoir . Lots of 19 to 24 inch walleye . We finally found out where to catch big pike there also after MUCH searching . .......We like Ogoki /Mojikit and Mattice Lake Outfitters so much that we have names our 3 chocolate labs , Goki , Moji and Matti . If you name your ""kids"" after where you like to go then the place must be special ,Eh ? Good Luck and stop along the way and ENJOY the sights . I know with Mattice you will have a great time . Also there will be a camp attendant at Whitewater and he will help you with fihing spots."
1200285,deputy dog,2010-05-13 20:54:00,305,"ogoki, did you, or anyone else, use a guide while there? anyone to specifically ask for-stay away from? thanks again for the info"
1200589,Ogoki,2010-05-15 02:20:00,291,"Deputy Dog, Never found a guide necessary . Take a map (which they give you) take a compass or GPS and have at it . Makes a real nice trip when they point you in couple directions and then put yourself on the fish . Take a good portable depthfinder too. I have done numerous canoes in that area and always catch plenty of fish with paddle power and no depth finder so a motor boat and depth finder should make it real easy. I am going on a spring and fall bear, bow hunt this year so I will miss eating those Ogoki River walleyes . Eat some for me and I want a trip report ."
1215231,deputy dog,2010-07-01 13:44:00,305,leave next thursday anyone got anything to add? how about road construction and such....thanks!
1196103,deputy dog,2010-05-03 08:07:00,305,"headin north to armstrong station, ontario for the first time this july. first time headin this route having always gone through buffalo and up through north bay. mapquest has us goin from ohio up I-75 crossing at sault ste. marie, then on 17 to 527 north to armstrong station. wondering how the crossing at sault ste. marie is and if there are any ""must stops"" along the route. road conditions, necessary fill ups, etc. any times to try and avoid with the border crossing? any info would be a huge help! using mattice lake outfitters and headin to whitewater lodge so any info on them would be appreciated also. thanks in advance!"
1196168,onetimedave,2010-05-03 10:37:00,502,"In SSM a must is the Float Plane Museum. It is on RT 17 in the city. About 40 miles North is the Canadian Carver. On the right side of road. Normal tourist junk with a lot of good carvings, good restrooms and a general store with GREAT ice cream. Both must stops."
1196189,polaris-pete,2010-05-03 11:23:00,343,"We are headed up to Pasha lake ( Jellicoe, Ont) mid June. I just did a AAA Trip Tik and they want us to head that way also but looks like theres an awful lot of road construction going on that way. I just came back from NorthBay a few weeks ago and their roads are all in great condition and the speed limit is leniently enforced if not going too much over the limit. Between the AAA way and the GPS versions, for us anyway (Youngstown NY ) it is 3 hours longer going through Michigan. Canada here we come! Good Luck fishing!~~~"
1196309,PIKEMAN330,2010-05-03 16:01:00,101,"Crossing time going north at The Sue is really nothing.Coming back will take a little longer,but still not bad.I have never been to Whitewater but have fished near there a few times and it is a very nice area. Good fishing,Pikeman"
1196364,skindzier,2010-05-03 18:27:00,137,"In the Soo, if the timing is right, grab lunch, dinner or a beer at The Antlers.http://eupnews.com/2010/04/the-antle...gh-video-tour/"
1196480,Whopper,2010-05-04 06:03:00,340,Been that way a few times myself and 17 between the Soo and Thunder Bay is a very scenic route and one of my favorites.
1196483,deputy dog,2010-05-04 06:19:00,305,thanks for all the good info! any construction updates and how about the road conditions? thanks again
1196497,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2010-05-04 06:54:00,629,"I can't provide any insight on travel conditions from your area to Armstrong, but I believe you have made a good choice with Mattice Outfitters. It has been several years since making our trip with Mattice, but our whole trip was very memorable. Facilities were very nice, as we went to one of their Northern outposts. Enjoy!"
1197096,fosterthedog,2010-05-05 17:14:00,51,get what you need in thunderbay once you turn on to 527 there is nothing until you get to armstrong station(and it ain't real pretty) Have a Great trip! P.S. watch out for the police and log trucks.
1197107,EyeBanger,2010-05-05 18:18:00,23,"There is a nice little set of falls about 30 miles north of the Soo, on the Chippewa River. It's a little rest stop/picnic area. Several very nice scenic lookouts are clearly marked along Highway 17 between the Soo and Wawa. Be sure to stop in to Young's General Store in Wawa, about a mile off of Highway 17 on Rt 101. It's like stepping back in time about 60 years. We've been driving that route every summer for over 20 years, and never tire of it. Enjoy your trip."
