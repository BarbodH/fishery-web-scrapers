1214727,bpetersen,2010-06-29 22:54:00,251,Have the camps been full or have there been some empty cabins this year?
1214736,2746,2010-06-30 01:56:00,3206,Yes to both.....depends on the week.
1214881,bpetersen,2010-06-30 11:58:00,251,I was up June 5-12 and saw some pretty quiet camps.
1214937,2746,2010-06-30 15:49:00,3206,Where we go the 1st couple of weeks in May were slow and then had picked up. On the other hand the camp we use still had some openings most weeks so things are certainly not what they were before the recession.
1215009,Obabikon,2010-06-30 20:42:00,2370,"We're currently slow, but will be very busy in a week. It all just depends. There aren't many camps (if any) out there that have zero openings all year."
1215478,Larry Mac,2010-07-02 13:11:00,530,"We were in Camp 6/19 thru 6/26 and camp was full. We are going back 7/30 thru 8/7 and camp is full. I agree with the above statement about ""both"". I have heard of a lot of openings (especially mid to late summer) from friends who are coming back from their trips. Have a great season.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1215589,Glenman12,2010-07-03 05:55:00,762,Hi Larry..I talked to our camp owner about this very thing when we were up the week of June 11th..he said that last year was his best in the 12 years he's owned the camp..he said this year so far he is down 10% in bookings..
