1214605,bob oh,2010-06-29 17:44:00,3936,I have a lot of charter crews that are short 1 or 2 or more fisherpersons who backed out at the last minute. And this is just a ONE_DAY trip! I would not plan a trip and make reservations without a deposit from each person. If anyone backs out use their deposit to entice another person to go on the trip.
1214813,Kruger,2010-06-30 08:29:00,259,The lodge we go to requires a deposit of $125 each. Anybody going has to pay that.
1214913,davenathe,2010-06-30 14:00:00,113,"Have had it happen too often, guys back out at last minute without a valid reason. Inconsiderate to the group. Therefore some people do not to provide a deposit to me in advance, people that I know their word is golden, no issue so no deposit required."
1214404,IRISHATTACK,2010-06-29 05:18:00,44,What do you do as the organizer of the trips when one or two members of the party do not respond to emails or call when it comes to being in or out of next years trip. How long do you give them? Are deadlines concrete? Most outfitters once booked want deposits to hold that week. I have been given two weeks. Need a little help on this one. Thanks in advance.
1214409,doubleheader,2010-06-29 05:49:00,2652,"Be honest, tell them what you need, why you need it, and when you need their response. If they do not respond within the time you've asked consider them a ""no"". If they don't have the courtesy to respond when you as requested you certainly shouldn't feel an obligation to keep chasing them for an answer."
1214425,digjig,2010-06-29 07:01:00,146,"Perfect answer DH. This is an example of an email we have used in the past. "" All, Our trip for 2011 to XYZ Resort on Lake ABC has been confirmed by XYZ Owners Name for XX/YY/2011. They require a deposit of $X.00 per person by XX/YY/2010. I know we all need to get our calenders in order. So, please confirm if you will be going or not by XX/YY/2010 as I need to let XYZ Owner Name know. This gives us N weeks/days to see who is going and who is not going. *** If I do not have a confirmation from you by XX/YY/2010, I will assume you are not going as XYZ Owners Name requires firm numbers in advance. *** Thanks guys, Organizer's Name """
1214426,JDP,2010-06-29 07:11:00,1457,"I (on behalf of my group) do about the same as DH and DJ.However, my resort requires the deposit January 1st.Therefore, We have an agreed upon deadline of December 1st for deposit submission to me. We use $200 as the deposit amount. This shows a real commitment to the trip. The deposit is refunded if the group feels that a person has a valid reason for dropping out (thus far only one drop out due to illness)."

1214484,Kruger,2010-06-29 10:36:00,259,You make people give you a deposit?
1214493,labsrus,2010-06-29 10:59:00,557,"We have been going on a fly in fishing trip with the same core of 4 guys, it seems to flex each year to 8 or 10 guys. We will all put in $200 each for the lodge deposit. At least 2 months before the trip an additional $200 is put into the kittly The kittly is kept by the trip organizer to pay for early food or beverage purchases. The kittly is also used for tolls and gas on the way to the lodge. When we get tot he lodge each person will pay their balance to the lodge. We have a spreadsheet that sows typical menus and food purchases. Each year within a few weeks of returning home from our trip we will get together to exchange photos and refine the list for the following years trip."
1214498,Golden Eagle,2010-06-29 11:15:00,2642,"IRISHATTACK, I sent you a PM."
1214509,JDP,2010-06-29 12:15:00,1457,"I am only acting as a representative of the group with the Lodge.A deposit ensures commitment, not just wishful thinking about the trip.I collect deposits from each trip participant and mail a check to the Lodge on behalf of the group."
1214534,chevtow,2010-06-29 14:08:00,691,"I usually go with family, but some friends have been bugging me to take them to Canada. This yr was going to be the 1st but they all backed out( I hadn't made any reservations). I've now told them no trip will be scheduled until I get $200 from each of them non-refundable. This way if they all back out again I won't care and I'll use the money to get a cabin for the family."
