1213800,ed08walleye,2010-06-27 05:24:00,27,What is a typical amount to tip the pilot?
1213837,Crede,2010-06-27 08:36:00,134,"On our flyins we tip the pilot $10 per person each way (e.g. group of 6 we tip $60 going in and $60 going out). We put one guy in charge of this before we leave home and it gets added to the ""tally"" (along with gas on the drive up, shared motel rooms, etc.) that we divide up after we get home. I have no idea what others do in this regard, so am interested to hear other responses."
1213850,515,2010-06-27 09:40:00,254,"For the pilot we do the same as Crede, 10 bucks per man but we usually only tip on the way in. We also do 10 bucks per man for the ground crew working the docks and keeping the planes moving."
1213890,celticbass1,2010-06-27 12:29:00,67,"We have never tipped the pilot, I have always assumed he gets paid decent wages and never thought to tip him. I can tell you that as a person who has gone to several foreign countries, Americans are considered very strange when it comes to tipping. What I mean to say is that most people from other countries think we tip too many people and that we tip too much. We always tip the dock hands $10.00 each."
1213926,Skywagon,2010-06-27 14:31:00,1106,"Celticbass1, I don't think Canada is so 'foreign"" to the US. A lot of the float plane pilots in Canada, have to make their money in a few short months, many have to scrounge for work or don't have any, the rest of the year. Most are not over paid and rely on tips as part of their wages (just like waitresses). With that said, when I was one of those ""foreign Americans"" doing fly in trips, we usually gave the pilot $10 in and out. Now that I fly both flags, I can say, there seems to be no less tipping on this side of the border."
1214765,MorganMan,2010-06-30 06:32:00,341,"We usually have anywhere from 5 to 8 guys going each year and we all throw money into a pot before we leave for gas, groceries, duty on beer, etc..... We switch the pot to Canadian as we cross and back to US when we get back so everyone is not toting both American and Canadian funds as that is a pain. So everything comes out of the pot, including the tip to the pilot. We tip both ways and tip $50 to $60 bucks. I guess we have this weird idea that if the pilot doesn't like us or we don't tip, he will fly crazy and maybe even crash so that only he lived????? lol....They do deserve it."
1215222,Crappie Kid,2010-07-01 12:57:00,1581,In total I gave the boys at the dock around $100-$120 for the weeks worth of help. They earned every loonie. That much was in my budget for the trip. We did a fly-out one day and the owner was the pilot and the guide was his Dad (previous owner). I think I gave the guide $60-$80 for getting me and my son on 35 Muskies for the day. I did not tip the owner-pilot but probably should have. Good folks at Stanleys on Eagle lake. I will be back.
