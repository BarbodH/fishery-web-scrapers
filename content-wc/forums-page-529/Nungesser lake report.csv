1213305,kgeary,2010-06-24 18:34:00,88,That group fished North Bay and around Wolf Island for the most part. Primarily with a simple jig and worm. As the week went on the walleye went deeper and on Thursday they were fishing 22 feet of water. Interestingly since last weekend we have been getting tons of walleye on the sand flats in 5-7 feet of water. The Leonovitz party was doing fantastic in 18 feet around the flats using beef heart. ( yes beef heart) the week of 12-19. It will all be in the report that I'm working on. The past 5 days has seen a lot of dead calm mornings with mile high skies highlighted with thunder storms. Not the perfect recipe for fishing however the walleye have stayed up in that shallow water. The did shut down a bit during midday when dead calm. Not nearly as many big pike this week.(19-26). The big pike hunters were a bit frustrated last week but still managed several 45 inchers and a number or 40somthings. (how do you like that english)

1215542,kgeary,2010-07-02 20:42:00,88,"will post a full report saw lots of caribous this week A nice big bull came thru camp got a few good pics will post asap groups reported catching 700, 900 even over 1200 for a group of 4 but not too many over 26 inches. no 28-30 that I've heard. I suspect that this next week will be outstanding for big walleye. I was wondering if the early ice out and warm weather would affect all of the ""markers"" of the seasonal progression. specifically the May fly hatch whic typically happens the first week of July well we havn't seen any Mayflies yet. Many people shudder at the thought of booking theire trip during the dreaded mayfly hatch. I've found it to be the best week of the year. so I'm looking forward to the next few weeks."
