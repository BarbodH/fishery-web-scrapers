1214449,1700SS,2010-06-29 08:31:00,104,Road construction on Hwy 11 from the Falls to Baudette is going on I am hearing. I am staying in Virginia on 53. I would rather cross at Baudette and not International Falls. I was wondering if anybody has taken Rt 1 from Cook over to Rt 72. 72 north up to Baudette? What kind of shape is Rt 1 in with pulling a trailer? Thanks in advance for any updates.Brett

The were tearing it up in sections and My trailer got the (****) beat out of it. I went to pick up some windows for a new cabin we are building and it was so rough that one of the windows was broken when I got back. I would just crossing I. Falls and save the construction hassel.
