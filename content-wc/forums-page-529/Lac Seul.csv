1215337,BenBeattie,2010-07-01 21:35:00,232,"Water level is down from normal. Not sure about the construction though. Catching a lot of walleye this week in 25-30'. Cabbage is coming in nicely, tops out of the water in a lot of places. Seek and ye shal find!"
1215407,grumbler,2010-07-02 07:38:00,10,"according to the ""site"" the lavel is at normal stage for this time of year if I read it correct. Thanks for the info Grumbler"
1215431,wallydave,2010-07-02 08:54:00,2151,"I have read about some road work on some other postings found here. Nothing to major, some single lane types of reports. There are always two seasons maybe three depending on how you look at it. Walleye, winter and construction!! Hope they will be biting for you, walleyes, not the bugs!!"
1215452,WalleyeRip,2010-07-02 10:50:00,44,Came back from Sioux Lookout heading toward Dryden two weeks ago and was told there was a wash out on 502 and if not closed it was down to one lane. Made a huge mistake detouring around it to 622 and down to Atikokan and over on 11 into Fort Francis. 622 is really rough and there was a 5 mile part just before Fort Francis that was completly taken out. Needless to say I have a chip in the windsheild and broke the trailer lights with all the rocks being thrown up. I suggest you call the OPP in Dryden to get a highway report and not do the same dumb thing I did.Slammed the walleyes all ten days though.......Rip
