1213558,thunder1,2010-06-25 19:52:00,27,I would recommend Gold Pines Camp at Ear Falls. Been going there 15 yrs. all times of the year and never disappointed. Very reasonable rates.
1213565,Riceburner,2010-06-25 20:35:00,436,Pls email me--I have a couple questions about your trip to Black Bay.[email protected] thx.
1213864,Guest,2010-06-27 10:36:00,0,"I too have fished Eagle for years since 1970 in fact. In the late 90's I learned about Anderson's Lodge. (10 miles south of Sioux Lookut. The folks are great that run the lodge and the accommodations are excellent. You may wish to take your entire family. They have all sots of different packages as well as housekeeping arrangements.I take my own boat and fish many lakes in the area. THey can provide fishing license, bait and Deception landing passes for use on Lac Seul if you use housekeeping plan and your own boat. (not needed if you use guided trips). AS to where to fish on Lac Seul it doesn't seem to matter. You can find them almost anywhere. Howefver there also exists many many many areas to avoid called ROCK !!! Be certain to get a map and watch your depth finder to learn the proper routes to use with maximum safety. I f you have already gone on your trip I jhope you enjoyed the area as much as most do. If you have yet to go Anderson's may be booked. However laways check for cancellations for later in the year. If you have a set time that you prefer reserve for next year ASAP! I'm going this Wednesday and staying at Lamplighter motel for first half and Anderson's the second week. The motel is basic but has small mikni fridge and micro to get by. Anderson's is very modern and first class.Whether you utilize American or housekeeping plan I would suggest that you try the restaurant on site at Anderson's Great food If you need info on where to fish and what to use don't be afraid to ask Jackie or Jody at checkin or one of the guides after they clean their catches or as they unload. Crawlers (a 1/3 or half) is the ticket this time of year. Minnitaki which you can access from the lodge is also very goos for 'eyes and northern and muxky. Don't for get the sdmallies as well lotsa fun for all! If I could figure out how I could afford to stay all summer I would. I have fished, Lac Seul, Big Vermillion, Little Vermillion (at Park just down the road from the lodge). Also Pelican, Abrahms, Minnitaki, Hooch, Maskinonge, and Deception lake. All have their own charcteristics but all have great fishing. It will take time to learn all the spots. I hope I live long enough to learn them all! Good luck and tight lines. Let me know how your trip when you have time off the water. Be safe and have fun that's what it's all about."
1215550,muskiemamma,2010-07-02 21:11:00,6,If you want a great fishing trip and lodge check out Moosehorn Lodge.www.canadafish.comWould love to have you.
1215696,Jim6buck,2010-07-03 17:22:00,4,Is this on Lac Suel?
1215702,teddi,2010-07-03 17:50:00,349,"No it,s just an ad for them"
1215780,Jim6buck,2010-07-04 01:09:00,4,Looking for a recommendation for Lac Seul. I have never been there before and I know it can be hard to find fish. We were booked with Mattice Lake Outfitters but had to cancle and lose our deposit because of a fly in issue. Two fathers and 12 year olds looking for a private cabin and American were we can bring our own boat. We found american but we would be in a hotel room. Would prefer a Lodge that can put us on fish so we do not need a guide everyday maybe just the first day. Dumb question? If we find an Outpost can we find a restraunt for dinner at night? Is there a better part of the lake were we can do this? Jim
1215811,wallydave,2010-07-04 07:21:00,2151,"I have always had good luck at Goose Bay Camp near Ear Falls. Even in high, low water, and different seasonal complications, Andrea, has put us on the fish. Just my $.02 worth."
1215880,davenathe,2010-07-04 12:12:00,113,"Mahkwa, best fishing on the lake. We go late August when less pressure and easily catch 75+ walleye per person per day. We do house keeping but people that do American say it is very good."
1191349,davenathe,2010-04-19 20:24:00,113,"August if my favorite time for Lac Seul, fewer bugs and walleyes are usually very hungry and on a definite pattern. I personally can easily average 75+ fish a day (fishing 6 to 7 hours). The stained water allows for the fish to bite all day. We fish Mahkwa out of Hudson area. See very few boats on daily basis. Our morning run we hit the islands about 4-6 miles from camp and have really found some great spots, then head back to camp for a late lunch and nap. The evening we fish within a mile or two of camp just in case there would ever be a boat issue. If anyone wants more info send PM. Deacon"
1201245,dawgpound820,2010-05-17 12:47:00,6,"I go the first week in June every year (4 years now) and last year was just miserable. Very cold and some snow. I'm already cheching the weather as I will be there Memorial weekend. Looks to be nice and warm and should be a great week once again. I really like Lac Seul Lodge and have no reason to check out any other place. The owner Dan is very nice and very helpful. The first year there he let us follw him to Sunlight which is great fishing, 200 in 4 hours, can't beat that. I would recommend his place to anyone, prices are pretty good also. Great fishing just in the 3 bays by camp also."
1201484,stumcfar,2010-05-18 07:28:00,451,"We stayed at Gold Pines one year. The owners are some of the best we have ever dealt with. The only downfall was the quality of the rental boats, not up to what other resorts have. I'm not sure of your statement of the expense at Golden Eagle. In all the years we have been going, they are the most inexpensive place we have stayed. I don't think one can go wrong with any of the resorts around Ear Falls."
1203789,Guest,2010-05-25 09:57:00,0,"Lost Island. Friendly, plenty of equipment, several different plans, everything one would need for a great fishing experience."
1204155,Guest,2010-05-26 10:51:00,0,"I have been to Goose Bay Camp about a half dozen times. Andrea has always put us on the fish. She has well equiped boats, the camp is close to several walleye hot spots, the Sancuary and Saw Mill Bay. Last year we were late for us, we usually plan for June 1st, when the Sancuary opens, plus is was warmer than usual, along with high water, our usual spots did not produce, but she still put on the walleyes! Her Camp is close to town, and good fishing!"
1209705,MisterD,2010-06-13 12:43:00,6,I just got back from a week fishing at Evergreen Lodge on Lac Suel. We're planning to go back next year. The boats are new 19' Princecraft deep V hull and wide. All the boats have new 60hp Yamaha 4stroke motors. The cabins are well equipped and the beds are great. Gary and Patty the owner will go out of their way to make sure your trip will be remembered for years to come.... Good luck... Joel
1209766,rather-be-fishin,2010-06-13 16:38:00,429,Mister D How was the fishing? Where did you fish?
1209804,MisterD,2010-06-13 18:38:00,6,We caught a lot of fish. The 1st night over 60 eyes. The islands out front of Sawmill Bay was the best. Never mind bringing any Berkley baits. Nuckleball jigs in yellow-green and minnows are the best. There are a lot of places to snag up. Found 30lb braided with 25lb florocarbon leaders the best. At worst you will bend the hook but you'll get unsnagged. We caught a lot of fish. 70% were over the limit size. 18.1 inches up to 26 inches. You are allowed by law to keep 4 fish. The restriction is no fish between 18.1 to 20.9 inches and only 1 greater than 20.9 inches. Evergreen Lodge would prefer you keep none over the 20.1 inches. If you have the spare cash get a guide for the day ( $150 ) and mark the spots on your GPS. Make sure he takes you to more than one spot. Garman makes great ones and you can download the Canadian inland waterways map and you'll be all set. Hope this helps....Joel
1212716,Walleye Joe,2010-06-22 20:58:00,27,"I'll be there for those dates too! With 5 other guys from Hannibal, Missouri. Looking forward to calling out.....FISH ON! See you in a couple of weeks!"
1212759,bmaster7,2010-06-23 00:01:00,3,A small world. We will be at the Black Bay Outpost from the 25th to the 3rd. Leaving from Quincy Il.
1175634,Guest,2010-03-08 08:51:00,0,Lac Seul Evergreen Lodge on the Ear Falls end has been good to us for many years. I like that end of the lake for lots of eyes.
1175667,Steve of Madison,2010-03-08 10:24:00,230,"I stay at Onaway, as was previously mentioned, this year july 9-16, because of it's location on the lake, docking and camp boats, and wonderful owners. SWW is for those that want or need American plan and guides everyday. Our group is very self sufficient, we enjoy cooking our meals and cooking what we want and when we want it.We are sometimes on the water from 8am to sundown and don't want to leave the fish when the dinner bells ring. We also have GPS and know the ins and outs on finding them. For a first timer I would certainly recommend hiring a guide for at least a couple of days, it's wonderful water but you can get turned around and mixed up in a hurry, plus the guide will help you with pattern and presentations.Have a great time, LS is an absolute gem!"
1175741,stumcfar,2010-03-08 14:17:00,451,"Right next to Evergreen is Golden Eagle Resort. They have treated us well, have nice cabins and good boats and are not very far from very good early fishing. From what we have found, about the most reasonable rates around there. Just another option for you."
1175759,teddi,2010-03-08 14:59:00,349,golden eagle and evergreen are both very good. i know both places and recommend either one for lac seul fishing.
1175788,Guest,2010-03-08 15:50:00,0,"Wallhawk I will echo the endoresment of Jigger1, that being Silver Water Wheel. I started fishing Canada when I was 10, and except for a couple of years due to summer committments, I have been going at least once every year. The last 10 have been to SWWL and we love it. Mike and his team does a great job. As Jigger1 said, as to your own boat check with Mike, but one thing I enjoy is during the day we are with a guide and he is constantly working to put us on fish and then willing to provide suggestions to me on how to become better at whatever technique we are doing. I like that in a guide. Then during the evening the boat is ours to run by ourselves (no quide) and we can practice what we learned that day, both in terms of finding fish, the technique and then boat control.. Given his boats are first class and the roads are not, I never felt the urge to trailer my boat that far. There are lots of great resorts run by great people, but Mike and Missy would be at the top of the list in my book...Of course I have not been everywhere I am in Dubuque, so good to have another Iowan on the site. If you go to SWWL, let me know asI could give you some ideas what to expect before hand. ...Cheers... IA Walleye"
1175895,wallhawk,2010-03-08 20:30:00,22,Thanks everyone for the recommendations. I will do some research and hope to give one of these camps a shot soon...
1176845,SeulAreaWalleye,2010-03-11 08:20:00,100,"As a first timer, even armed with a GPS...I would take a guide out on your first day just to get a feel for the pattern. In my 17 years of guiding I've seen many people struggle as newcomers, and hunt for a guide on their last day here. Regardless, it's Lac Seul and anywhere you go on the lake will be good to you, as long as you know what the fish are doing at the time.Being biased, I would have to agree with Ben on the East end spawning waters. I remember last year early season, we were hauling in the huge walleyes and the central portion was a bit slower at that time. Good luck on your first time to Seul, and feel free to message me if you have any other questions."
1176920,lonestarfisherman,2010-03-11 12:03:00,5,[quote=wallhawk;1175233]Trying to get a trip to Lac Seul put together soon... been going to Eagle for years but ready to try something new.What are your suggestions for lodges to try for a first timer. Have GPS and looking primarily for walleyes...Thanks!What part of Lac Seul are you looking to go to. The Northwest part near Ear Falls has many places to stay. I have been to many places in that area and have boated to McKensie Bay area to fish every trip. Have taken the houseboat out of Whitewing Resort many times also and fished the Windigo Point area and fishing there has even been better than McKensie Bay. If your looking for info on fishing Lac Suel can email me at [email protected] . You will definately love the fishing on Lac Seul.
1177245,Guest,2010-03-12 09:19:00,0,"I haven't heard anyone mention Gold Pines resort yet. Have been staying there many years. Family owned and operated and very helpful and nice people. It is located just outside of Ear Falls. The prices are more than reasonable and they have all the amenities you would need. Even great for kids/families. They have a little playground area with a swing set/ slide, etc... and a beach area for swimming. I've stayed at Golden Eagle as well and they are nice however a little overpriced in my opinion. Switched from there to Gold Pines and I wouldn't stay anywhere else."
1177262,LoDo,2010-03-12 09:47:00,721,"I have fished Lac Seul for several years and the past five had been spent at Fisherman's Cove. Dan, his family and crew are wonderful hosts. My experience with early to mid June is you'll have a 30-40 min boat ride across the large body of water because you'll be fishing Upper and Lower Sands and all of McKenzie Bay. The reason is because the water on that end of the lake is 10-20 degrees warmer and the fish are spawning.I'm fishing the Woodland Provincial Park this year and won't be making it to Fisherman's Cove. Im interested in hearing and seeing pictures of the resort after the tornado that hit last summer. The tornado came through three weeks after I was there.We'll fish McKenzie for 5 days and we'll fish the waterfall area for a day. The waterfall is worth seeing, however, I don't believe the fishing is as good during that time. Troll islands all through McKenzie and you'll catch 100s of eyes!Good luck!"
1175314,Skywagon,2010-03-07 05:51:00,1106,"May weather can be iffy. Last year was strange and did not get really nice until September. This year the winter has been great and the weather has been so nice, with lots of sun, you want to just stay outside. Perfect for ice fishing. If this trend continues, it may be an early spring."
1175391,Jigger1,2010-03-07 09:38:00,234,"Wallhawk - I would suggest doing what I did 11 years ago. I had fished LOTW & Eagle many times and wanted to step up the size and quantity of walleye fishing. When I set my mind on LacSeul I looked up the lodges and proceeded to send out about 10 different emails from Ear Falls to Sioux Lookout and those in between. Bar none the most compelling response I received was from SWWL. I ended up selecting Silver Water Wheel Lodge and this will be my 11th consecutive year back. Mike and his team are the real deal and you will be taken care of the entire time. Literally your only worry when you arrive to the lodge is catching walleyes. The guides, equipment and food is all top notch. I would highly recommend giving them a look. The other added bonus is their location, they are in the south central portion of LacSeul and they pretty much have this part of the lake to themselves. Only 91 days until I'm back!"
1175411,wallhawk,2010-03-07 10:20:00,22,Thanks for the info... I have heard SWW mentioned more than once by fellow posters. I have never stayed anywhere with the American plan but it doesn't sound all bad. I take it that every boat gets a guide every day? What if you take your own boat?thanks...
1175421,orchard frank,2010-03-07 10:35:00,1900,"Went to various places in Ontario and Quebec for over 35 years, ended up in 1993 Going to Lost Island Lodge out of Hudson, never went anyplace else for the next 13 years, often twice a summer. Most trips with my wife, many with our son, some with buddies. Great accomodations, boats, equipment, and most of all the best, very best staff I have ever had the pleasure of being around. The Hayes family and Basil & Vivian became much more than hosts, they became dear friends. Even though our travel budget is now used to travel to Florida to see son, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter, we still exchange calls and cards, even though we haven't been for quite a while. When we finally decide to head north again, I wouldn't even consider anyplace else. Plenty of good choices, this is mine. Hire a guide early in the trip, learn the lake a little. You can go far or stay close. One year, we decided just for the heck of it, to stay nearby, barely got out of sight of the lodge for about 5 days, still caught a ton. But, there are miles and miles to explore if you want. Good Luck, Have a ball"
1175426,wallhawk,2010-03-07 10:57:00,22,"Looks like a nice place as well. What are the differences between the west, central and eastern parts of the lake in your opinion? Is there any difference? I know from fishing on Eagle for years that I would like to be located near the bigger central part of the lake as that is where I fish the most, but the camp we have been going to for years (and love the hospitality) is near Vermillion Bay on the north side of the lake. Makes for some longer boat rides than I would like but again... all time on the water in Canada is good time!"
1175428,BenBeattie,2010-03-07 11:13:00,232,The east end of Lac Seul (around Sioux Lookout) is definitely a good bet for early season walleye fishing. The lake is narrower here with many channels and current areas that attract and hold walleye during early season. Check out www.canadafish.com for the Moosehorn Lodge web site. They will accomodate any type of trip that you'd like. I guide for them and would be happy to answer any questions you have about this incredible fishery.
1175479,2746,2010-03-07 15:36:00,3206,"We made the change from Eagle a few years ago as well after fishing there for 10 years or more. Like you, we were just looking for something different. Our first choice was Gullrock, where we still go each spring, and have now added a second trip each year to Lac Seul. We've stayed at Lac Seul Lodge and Onaway and have setteled on Lac Seul. Both have good housekeeping accomadations but Onaway is a Friday to Friday stay and that does not fit our shedules as well as a Sat. to Sat. We've enjoyed the change but went back to Eagle last year just for old times sake. They are all good fisheries."
1175489,Jigger1,2010-03-07 16:31:00,234,"Here's what I know of the lake. Both the east and the west sides of the lakes have more lodges and thus would assume more traffic. SWWL is basically isolated in the south central portion of the lake it's a short hour drive north of Dryden, the last 25 miles or so on dirt. The closest resorts are probably a good 30 minute boat ride at full tilt. Mike runs Alumacraft Tournament Pro 185's with 90 Yamaha's so that would be a good 15 miles. As such they pretty much have this portion of the lake to themselves. You will see the occasional boat but it's just that occasional. I feel exactly like Orchard Frank, I just couldn't imagine making a trip anywhere else. Mike does have a couple guests that bring their own boats, but you would have to speak to him about that. I have become very used to having one of his highly competent, personable and very well trained guides do all the work and I just worry about catching eyes. His guides work in concert with each other and they are put through an exhaustive training program and provided with all of the technology to put you on fish."
1175496,wallhawk,2010-03-07 16:58:00,22,That makes sense... thanks Ben.
1175628,Mike Kansas,2010-03-08 08:42:00,1463,I too will tell you that Lost Island Lodge is a great place. The fishing is awesome and the hospitality is second to none. We have gone there the last four years and will be going as long as we can. I have fished Lac Seul for 22 years and Lost Island is a Honey Hole. Mike Kansas
1175233,wallhawk,2010-03-06 19:09:00,22,Trying to get a trip to Lac Seul put together soon... been going to Eagle for years but ready to try something new.What are your suggestions for lodges to try for a first timer. Have GPS and looking primarily for walleyes...Thanks!
1175250,cspierings,2010-03-06 19:38:00,230,"I can't help to much on Lodges. The only one I have had much exposure to has been Cherob's, pretty straight folks to deal with but I haven't stayed there. They are on the Ear Falls end. We dealt with them on a motor problem and they got my Dad back in business ASAP and the work was real reasonable in terms of price. We get minnows there all the time and they given a more than fair count. You might want to let us know what time of year you are going and what part of the lake you are thinking about. Personally I think I would look at the middle part of the lake having fished the Ear Falls end for a lot of years. That is just a bias on my part to see some new water and try different things. I think that end is best right around the opener and for a few weeks after. Mostly walleye and pike fishing on that end of the lake. We have been seeing more smallies the last few years but not in big numbers, the fish we do catch though have been nice."
1175254,wallhawk,2010-03-06 19:51:00,22,Don't have any preference for what side of the lake. We normally go in mid to late July but may consider an early June trip as well.
1175257,Nimstug,2010-03-06 19:56:00,2605,"Wall,There are hundreds (?) of places on Seul. In order to get the best answer for you, give us some idea of your budget, if you want housekeeping or American plan, some special amenity. Will there be a female in your party? Even something you don't want. Many of the lodges not only on Suel but other parts of NW Ontario are already booked for their most popular times. When you might be going would help to. NimstugWhen I grow up I want to be a little boy."
1175259,wallhawk,2010-03-06 20:00:00,22,"Housekeeping plan is fine... my wife and 2 kids today go to Eagle and love to fish. A trip to Lac Seul might be just the guys though. I am leaning towards heading to Lac Seul with the guys in the spring and then back to Eagle in late summer with the family (we can only dream, right?). So... looking for some serious water time in early spring most likely."
1175265,rather-be-fishin,2010-03-06 20:24:00,429,"Wallhawk, I have been going to Fisherman's Cove in Scout Bay on Lac Seul for past several years and have been very happy with this resort, owners, cabins, dock service, boats/motors & location on the lake. However, they tend to have an excellent repeat customer base so may be booked. Check out their website at: www.fishermanscoveontario.com Other resorts located nearby on Scout Bay is Onaway Lodge. I haven't stayed there but have heard good things about the resort. Website: www.onawaylodge.com Another one is: Lac Seul Lodge on Rat Bay website: www.duenorth.net/lacseullodge If your family likes to fish, Lac Seul is an AWESOME walleye lake and they would have a blast catching many quality sized walleye.......My family is spoiled now and don't want to fish anywhere else!!! Good Luck planning your trip and have a great time. Four months and counting down to another trip to Lac Seul!!! Rather-be-fishin"
1175266,wallhawk,2010-03-06 20:27:00,22,Thanks for the suggestions... my Lac Seul trip is in the early planning stages so it might be best to schedule a trip in spring of 2011 as I will be headed to Eagle yet this summer.I will check out the links you provided... any insight into better spring than summer locations on Lac Seul? I understand it is a huge body of water and probably has about every type of structure you might want.thanks again...
1175270,rather-be-fishin,2010-03-06 20:56:00,429,"Wallhawk, I have always fished Lac Seul mid to late July & early or late August. I prefer the warmer weather and have always had good fishing and have never been disappointed! I know someone who always goes first week in June and last year they had cold, rain, sleet & snow.....so keep that in mind if you plan to go early...... Good Luck and have fun planning the trip(s), that is part of the fun too! Rather-be-fishin again~"
1175272,wallhawk,2010-03-06 21:00:00,22,"I went to Cedar Lake last June and had some of the most miserable weather I've seen in Canada. Then again, Eagle in July last year wasn't the best either... cold and rainy for the most part. I think 2009 weather was just poor in general."
1175286,Nimstug,2010-03-06 22:50:00,2605,You got that right. The lodge where I am going in Rainy said they found smallies on beds in September last year. Have fun planning!
