Anyone who knows this area and doesn't mind sharing some info would be appreciated. You can PM me or e-mail me at [email protected] if you don't want to post on here. We don't mind finding our own spots, but since we will only be there until Wednesday morning it would be nice to have some ideas where to start. Some people hold their spots pretty sacred, so I understand if you don't want to give any tips, but thanks in advance if you do!"
1214323,thunder1,2010-06-28 18:06:00,27,"there are a lot of good areas to fish in Mckenzie bay,big sandbank,little sand bank,ghost narrows on the far side of big island,aroung moose island and really aroung any of the islands.I have had best luck fishing where the wind is blowing in. Been going there 15 yrs and never disappointed."
1214343,LoDo,2010-06-28 19:27:00,721,"You'll be fine fishing all over McKenzie Bay. Find wind blown points, drop a line and reel'em in!!! The small island to the far NE end of the bay is solid. SW side of island, 10-15ft of water. Ghost Narrows, mouth of Broad Lake, Big and Lil sands are good spots. Troll with some #7 or larger Rapala for bigger eye's!! Good luck!"

1214845,thunder1,2010-06-30 10:09:00,27,"you can see little sand from big sand,just north east."
1214847,thunder1,2010-06-30 10:13:00,27,"there are a lot of unmarked rocks in McKenzie,be careful."
1214854,LoDo,2010-06-30 10:31:00,721,"Agree with the unmarked areas, be careful!!"
