1213328,Paxton,2010-06-24 20:19:00,10,Anyone ever been to Marr's Perch Lake Lodge or Branch's Seine River Lodge? Both of them are on the Seine River System near Atikokan. How is the fishing? How clean is the lodge?
1213360,jfsh,2010-06-24 22:07:00,13,I've fished the Seine river/lake system seven times. I've stayed at Marr's but not Branch's. Very satisfied with our trips. Feel free to email me at: [email protected] Ken river/lake system
