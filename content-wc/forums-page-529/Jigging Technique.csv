1213955,Warrior56215,2010-06-27 16:58:00,46,What is your favorite jigging technique? I vertical jig but am wondering what kind of success people have with other techniques?
1214768,Jig A Lowe,2010-06-30 06:42:00,87,"Unless the fish are located directly under the boat, then vertical jigging would have limited success. I cast out and allow sufficient time for the jig to settle to the bottom and then (softly) bounce the jig back to the boat. Using this technique, you will find out soon enough if all of your hook ups are straight down and at the end of the retrieve."
1214836,bassface44,2010-06-30 09:46:00,96,I prefer to vertical jig with a subtle lift/drop cadence and maybe let the wave action help out a little. I will speed up from time to time and get more aggressive with the snap pause but subtle seems to be better. I do cast and jig sometimes but I prefer it to be relatively snag free. I lose enough jigs vertically.
1214846,Blue Lk,2010-06-30 10:10:00,269,"I troll as slow as possible(elec troller),jigging vertically.Slow means you can keep your bait close to bottom & in the zone.Less chance of snagging as there is in cast & reteive.This has been working for me for years."
1214862,Guest,2010-06-30 10:55:00,0,"For vertical jigging you either need to be right on them, or I will set up a drift using the wind to cover territory. Cast-jigging is effective too, especially on rock humps and drop offs. My home water is the Mississippi and the current is usually too fast to drift, so anchoring and casting a bottom-bouncer rig or a Vibe/Sonor blade bait and jigging it back is the way to go. Bottom-bouncer with a stick sinker is a good way to keep from getting hung up in rocks and timber - and you can pretty much use anything on the end of it. Floating rapala, plastics, spinner rigs, and just plain live bait."
1215240,davenathe,2010-07-01 14:33:00,113,"if sand bottom, use lightest jig possible and let it drag, sometimes excellent results."
1215247,515,2010-07-01 14:58:00,254,So far I agree with all the techniques so far and I use them all till I find whats working. I'm not much for the vertical jigging as I like a bit more action but it does have a purpose.
1215338,BenBeattie,2010-07-01 21:39:00,232,I always tell my guests in the boat that 'less is more'. i.e. don't over jig and keep it within a few inches of the bottom. I do a lot of vertical as well as pitching/cast & retrieve. Put it in their face and there's a good chance they'll hit it. I like the Lindy x-change jigs so I can change weights / colors without re-tying or changing bait.
