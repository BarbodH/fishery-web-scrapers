1214164,cspierings,2010-06-28 10:09:00,230,I am taking the whole family up to Ear Falls for a week of fishing starting the 3rd of July. Has anyone been up recently that can comment on the water level and fishing conditions? Any luck on crawlers yet or is it still a minnow bite? Thanks

Check with the place you are staying, they will want to put you on the fish, so you will book a return trip! There are a few other threads on Lac Seul, check them out for your info. I have always had good luck in the Ear Falls area of Lac Seul, we have always stayed at Goose Bay, and Andrea has always put us on the fish. This year will be different, than most, an early ice out and spawn, seems to translate that the eyes, will be on the move! Have a safe trip and good fishing! When you get back tell us all about it!"

We've been going for the last 6-7 years and have never been disappointed, no matter what side of Lac Seul you fish. Your lodge will put you on the fish."
