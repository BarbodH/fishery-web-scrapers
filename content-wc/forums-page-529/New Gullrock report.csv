If possible I am looking for some help on locating some of the well known spots I have read about here, on the map. I was there in 2007 and spent almost all our time off the boot. We did well but I would like to finds a reef or two. I appreciate any feedback."
1209728,luv2fishcanada,2010-06-13 14:46:00,41,"Just got back from Gullrock. Have been going there for the past 30 years. Fishing was good, great at times. This year compared to most years the fish were smaller. We managed to catch several over 25"" but caught way more smaller, 15"" and 16"" fish than normal. The mayflies are starting to show up, other bugs not too bad. Both crawlers and minnows worked well. Fish are in the same places as normal. We still found fish in 8-11 feet of water. Boot produced nice fish. Going up on Friday, we hit the boarder at about 1:00 pm and had about a 15 minute wait. Coming back on Friday at around noon it was 2 plus hours. Not much road construction. On 17 between Dryden and Vermillion Bay and on two spots on 105 they are working on bridges and the traffic is down to one lane with traffic lights. 502 is about normal. Not sure what is going on with the toll both, I saw a sign toll booth ahead that was in the weeds but no toll booth. Water surface temp already at 60. Water level is down 6"" from last year. Lots of rain so no real fire threats. Everyone going up, have a safe trip, still a lot of critters crossing the road."

1211042,tackleman,2010-06-17 13:41:00,444,"I was at the boot last night and could have filled the boat with fish from 23 feet of water, but this morning I talked to 2 boats of guys who were finding it slow.I was in Keg this morning and it was slow, still got fish but nothing like it could be, may have something to do with the storm front moving in for the afternoon."
1211049,2746,2010-06-17 14:03:00,3206,That's fishing ......even in Canada and on Gullrock!
1214649,Bigfish10702,2010-06-29 19:19:00,60,"Got back on Saturday, had a good week. Lots of fish off the boot 17 - 20 ft both bottom bouncing and jigs. Best spinner was silver blade with red beads, best jig was grn/yellow 3/8. Hooked into a couple monster pike, but they tore us up then went on their merry way. Got into some real nice 11'' to 12'' perch. No worms either, brought a bunch home. MMMMM....mmmmmm. Fishing sure is boring at home now..."
