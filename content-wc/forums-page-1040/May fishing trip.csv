510418,Homer,2000-12-29 15:04:00,1127,Looking for any word on these 3 lakes..4 of us going to canada for weeks fishing and need some help deciding..Lady Evelyn Lake and Lost lake in Ontario...O'Sullivan Lake in Quebec...Thanks..Any other place worth mentioning that has great walleye and pike fishing??
510419,Guest,2000-12-29 20:23:00,0,"Homer,I understand that Lady evelyn lake has good eye fishing. I don't think you will find good pike fishing in any of these lakes. From the places you are considering it sounds like you are from the east coast becasue these places a driving accessible from the North east. I would reccomend that you look in Northwestern Ontario for true canadian fishing. I have a place for you if you e-mail me i will send you info. Good luck and have great time!!"
510420,Guest,2000-12-30 19:28:00,0,"Tyler, Right you are about being from the east..3 of us from central Penn and the other from Toledo...We would not be against going north from Toledo to the Wawa area and north...Just really looking for good pike and walleye fishing..."
510421,Tyee,2000-12-30 22:28:00,60,"This past June (1st week) my son and I did a ""father-son"" trip upto Lady Lake Evelyn....caught a fair number of walleye (my songot a 27 1/2"" - 7 lbs) and the rest were 2-3 lbs....got a few pike up to 5 lbs, and had a great time. We stayed at the Red PineLodge, although I've stayed at Island 10 a number of other timesin the early fall with my fishing buddies. Nice lake with decentfishing and nice lodges.....I believe the other post is correct,that better fishing is found in western Ontario, though what adrive ! Lady Lake Evelyn does have big fish, but most guys on most weeks don't pull them. It's a great place to spend a week,and both Red Pine and Island 10 have nice facilities. Email meif you need any particulars. Good luck on your decision.Tyee"
510422,Homer,2000-12-31 16:38:00,1127,Thanks for the info..My one friend is a Pike-A-Holic and we will look for a lodge that offers a chance at big pike...We will target walleye for shore lunches and then hit the pike fishing..Thanks to all that respond...
