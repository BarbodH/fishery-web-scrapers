510696,Guest,2001-01-25 14:10:00,0,"In addition to the question above, where are some ontario parks that offer good fishing as well?I have heard of Ojibway Provincial Park on Little Vermillion being a good spot, but I am interested to hear of any others. By the way, how much does it cost to camp at these places?Any help answering my questions and the one above would be much appreciated. ThanksKyle"

You can register ahead sometimes depending on the park.Wilderness parks are a different story. Many will only allow a certain number of people in. Good campsites can be at a premium. Some allocate a site. It depends where you go. Find out what park you are going to and do your research. As I said earlier the rules can be different for each park. Frank
