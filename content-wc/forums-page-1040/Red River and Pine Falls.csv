This year however, the fishing has been less than good. Is everyone having the same hard time finding/catchng walleyes? Only positive thing is that when I do hook one, it is always over 20 inches. Biggest one was Jan 1 at 27 inches.Was wondering about Pine falls. Anyone fishing that area and if so are they biting? I need to burn off my vacation time and would like to find some good fishing. Thanks"

I know of nobody who has had a good year on the Red this winter, although I have seen a few bigger fish caught.Can`t comment on Pine Falls."
