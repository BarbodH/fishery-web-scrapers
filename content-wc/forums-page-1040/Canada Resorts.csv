We catch plenty of walleyes but would like to try a new place in the general area of Ignace, Ontario. We've read about Hubers Lone Pine Resort but am not sure how the fishing would be there. We always go the first week of Sept. Anyother suggestions? We have been spoiled by not having very many boats on the lakes we ahve fished the last ten years. The thing we don't want to have is to be on a lake with a hundred other boats. We prefer a drive-in resort with a housekeeping plan. Walleye is what we want to fish for. We would appreciate some help.Thanks,Bob Shomaker"
509904,Guest,2000-10-02 06:16:00,0,MB.......maybe we should all gather around your computer and explore all the options we can come up with. We could probably make a decision that way and get the ball rolling....pointman

Older lady owns the resort, nice cabins and nice little campgrounds, small resort, they do not rent boat motors there, just boats. Walleye fishing is very goodand you can catch some decent pike too! Only camp on the lake, so not a lot boat traffic. I think 1 or two private cabins on the lake. I do not have the phone number handy to give you, name of the place is Basket Lake camp. good luck- Red"

You can portage to a fantastic smallie lake. Walleye and Muskie fishing is very good. THe food is fantastic, the boats and motors are great."
