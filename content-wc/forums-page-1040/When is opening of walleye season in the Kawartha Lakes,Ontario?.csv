510538,Guest,2001-01-14 19:40:00,0,Can anyone tell us when the season opens for walleye in the Kawartha Lakes area of Ontario? I cannot access the MNR website for some reason. Thanks
510539,Rick,2001-01-14 20:44:00,226,"According to the 2000 regulations, walleye season in the Kawarthas, which is in division 6, opens the second Saturday in May and closes on November 15. Remember though this is last years regulations and they might change slightly this year. There is also a note that says on Lake Scugog, you can ice fish for walleye from January 1 to the last day in Febuary. Tight lines!!"
