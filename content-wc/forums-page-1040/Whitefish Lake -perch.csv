I have seen some guys come off the lake with perch. No where near the catch rate used to be. The walleye have slowed down as of lately but will pick up in the next month.Roger Mayer."
510671,dlhomes,2001-01-26 08:49:00,62,Roger- I'm hopefully going to be up there 1st weekend in April. Two years in a row we fished this time and did great on eyes in only 2-3' of water! Have'nt been up there for approx. 5yrs now. Will stay at Come By Chance I imagine. Any tips on ice/snow conditions would be great. Read about Whitefish and decided to try it again.
