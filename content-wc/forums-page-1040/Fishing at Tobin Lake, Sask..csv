510658,Guest,2001-01-22 21:26:00,0,I plan on fishing at Tobin Lake from June 9th through June 13th. Does anyone know if the river would be better for fishing at that time than the Lake?
510659,Pikeman,2001-01-23 06:17:00,93,"My advice would be to try both. The river had fish all year long. If the water is muddy the fishing gets tough, and the lake may be a better idea.If you cant try both, i would go to the river, the fish are much easier to find and catch.Pikeman"
510660,Guest,2001-01-23 09:29:00,0,"Pikeman,Thank you for the information on Tobin. Guess we'll try the river first. Do you know how far it is from the Francis-Finley dam to the lake? Thanks again, Joe"
