It looks like a really nice place and the folks I talked to on the phone sound really nice. I'm renting one of their 3 bedrooms on the package with two of their 17' Lund fishing boats with 40 hp motors. Has anyone ever been there and can you tell me a little about this place? What kind of tackle should I bring? I plan to fish for walleyes, pike, and smallmouth.Thanks.Micael F."

You are not ""pampered"" with luxury, instead you are treated to an immaculately clean cottage, boats and motors that are well-maintained, attractive grounds and a staff that makes you feel genuinely welcome. We stayed in a 3BR cottage last August and were delighted with the entire experience. This family knows how to run a resort!Take plenty of jigs in assorted sizes and your favorite colors for eyes. Have an assortment of spoons in 3/4 oz and 1 oz sizes and a few RatLTraps for Northern. I had great success with 1/16, 1/8 and 1/4 oz mushroom jigs and 3"" grubs for smallies. Toss 'em along banks with round boulders.If you're not familiar with LOTW, take a handheld GPS receiver along. It can save you a lot of time and trouble.Good Luck!Bob"
