I have heard that they have great cabins, a beautiful lodge, nice boats, and great fishing. You can fish for lake trout, walleye, northern, muskie, small mouth bass, large mouth bass, and jumbo perch in the thirteen lakes they have boats in. It sounds to good to be true, so I would like any info that you have to offer."

510472,Guest,2001-01-11 09:50:00,0,"Fallsman, The Lodge is Northeast of Emo, Ont. It is on the Pipestone chain of Lakes. (Northeast corner of pipestone lake)Any information would be great."
510473,Fallsman,2001-01-11 11:12:00,93,"OK, it's not the same one I'm familiar with. Sorry, don't have info on this one."

If you really want hot walleye action I mean 250 walleyes a day, try Tommy Lake it is just 1 of their 12 portage lakes. good luck"

510478,Guest,2001-01-25 21:00:00,0,"Pipestone lake is decent fishing, but pressure has reduced size of lakers and trout. If Happy Landings has boats in the smaller lakes that feed Pipestone it would be worth a visit. I used to fish these in the winter and usually did real well on trout. Walleyes were tougher in the winter but great in the spring."
