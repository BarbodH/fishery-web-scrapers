510768,Guest,2001-01-28 14:48:00,0,It is a very nice main lodge. Dining room is on second floor overlooking lake giving you a beautiful view during your meals. Cabins are above average. Food is very good. Price is very reasonable. Scenery on Kipawa is as nice as it gets. Fishing is good but you need to know what you're doing. Mostly Lake Trout and Walleye. Sonar is a must and proper gear for deep water trolling for the lakers is recommended.
510769,Guest,2001-01-28 15:59:00,0,"Mike, thanks for the reply. I was wondering if you could tell me a little more about the walleye fishing. I have never been to the lake and any pointers would help. Will be there on the first week of June. I was planning on just trolling spinners/bouncers until I located some. Should I be targeting spawning areas?Thanks"
