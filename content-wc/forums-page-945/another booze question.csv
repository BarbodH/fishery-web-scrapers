I NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE AMOUNT OF DUTY THAT IS CHARGED ON LIQUOR OVER YOUR ONE CASE ALLOWANCE.THEY WON'T FORGET THE DAY THE BADGER CAME OUT TO PLAY."

Take the 55% you get on the U.S. dollar, go to the local liquor store and buy the best they have! Here is a little tip,,, NEVER go to a ""liquor store"" in Ontario and buy 24 cans of beer thinking it is a ""case"". It is 4 six packs and you will be charged as such!"
521751,retire55,2002-06-22 22:18:00,1029,"Hey Hunter:Where did you get your information?The Beer Store web site for example provides prices for Labatts Blue: 6 Bottle 341 ml9.25 12 Bottle 341 ml17.45 24 Bottle 341 ml32.75A 24 would cost $37.00 according to you?Yes, but you did say cans. Same web site provides the following: 6 Cans 355 ml10.50 12 Cans 355 ml19.95 24 Cans 355 ml37.25And you did say at the ""liquor store"". Firstly, most Canadians buy their beer at The Beer Store not at the liquor store. Secondly, the liquor store, which is the LCBO in Ontario, does sell Labatt blue at the very same prices as The Beer Store. Check it out!Any way you look at it, your ""tip"" doesn't appear very valuable!"
521754,Red Ruffandsore,2002-06-23 04:49:00,81,"If by ""home brew"" you mean domestic U.S. beer, no it can't be better to bring up your own. If you mean actual home brewed beer, by far that is the best scenario and worth any additional cost. Factor in space, weight, and the limited amount you can bring, and it's easy to see it ain't worth the hassle. But no store bought pisswater beats the flavour and aroma of a good home brew recipe. I store my home brew in green ginger ale 2L pop/soda bottles and make sure the original label is on. Pop them in a cooler and the coppers/customs barely glance at them. Ahhhhhh I think I'll go and open a nice pilsner right now.....homebrew, nectar of the educated."
521752,Hunter,2002-06-23 05:13:00,346,"Try and find a beer store in Northern Ontario!!!You will find liquor stores in every town, go in and buy 24 cans on beer at a liquor store, you will be charged for 4 six packs and not a case. Im in Northern Ontario at least 3 times a year, I know what im talking about!!!!"
521753,Hunter,2002-06-23 05:16:00,346,"Oh and buy the way, the cost for 24 cans at a liquor store is more like $42. Believe me I kicked myself in the a** for being so stupid!!"
