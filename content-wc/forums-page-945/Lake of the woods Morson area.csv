521778,PJM,2002-06-24 14:08:00,3516,tackle guy I was there from the 19th to the 22nd and the fishing was good with the fish now moving from the shallows to the reefs out from Morrison. 18 feet seemed to be a good depth but we did catch them deeper. Minnows are a problem with all the flooding because the beaver ponds were they trap the minnows and they are flooded out so you might want to bring spme night crawlers. The roads are a mess but you can get though but slow down were they are fixing them.
