521733,Guest,2002-06-23 20:32:00,0,"Got back yesterday, had very good fishing. First few days we fished in ranger and got a lot of eater sized fish plus a few larger ones. On gullrock, we fished the boot, had good luck on the three sisters, and as well as the point across from the three sisters. We fished a lot in two island lake, as that is where we stayed. People were using a variety of techniques, we used 1/4 oz jigheads tipped with minnows, but also saw people having luck trolling cranks, or even lindy rigs. Hope i could help a little"
521734,Guest,2002-06-24 05:50:00,0,Thank You for the report we are heading up in two weeks. If you were in Ranger that means the fish were very shallow. How deep were you fishing?ThanksJeff
521735,Guest,2002-06-24 13:01:00,0,"Yes, the fish were all shallow, our deepest fish we caught were in about 13' of water. We were really succesful in about 3-9' of water. One story, we were driving through ranger creek and there were a lot of people trolling through the actual creek catching fish, i let my jig out, and was going for a while when i went to move around a fallen log, i pulled the jig out of the water and i got a 20 incher that jumped out of the water and latched onto the jig! i had never seen that before. Overall we caught a lot of eaters, although we practice catch and release except for 1 day when we have shore lunch, we caught a lot of really nice fish, 18-25 inchers."
