521199,SWeed,2002-06-09 22:59:00,66,"which camp are you ataying at, is it near the channel between the two lakes???"
521200,Guest,2002-06-10 06:15:00,0,"I have fished these lakes for over 10 years. In spring I have often had good luck at Butler. There are several spots there that have been good. 1. as you make a right turn, (about 1 mile from the entrance to butler there is a rocky point which has been a good spot.2. After entering butler, go about a mile then to the right there is a small bay with islands at each end. Had good results there.Let us know what worked for you, I will be going up in July."

On Wabigoon, try fishing Devil's Island if there is a good West or South wind. Ask someone to tell you how to get to Devil's Island. It is very easy to find as it has a large marker on the west end of it & there are usually alot of boats around it. In addition, I would fish Dinorwic if you get a good South wind around Cemetary & Submarine Islands. Let us know how you do. I haven't fished these lakes in the last couple of years but there are good lakes for numbers of fish with real potential to catch a 10 pounder also."

521202,Guest,2002-06-17 19:14:00,0,"thanks babamel, your information on your spot on butler turned out to be the best spot, pulled a six pounder off there....great info...thx..if you ever want to come fishing this way, give me a email. again thx.."
521204,Guest,2002-06-23 23:33:00,0,We stayed at Pine Sunset Lodge on Dinorwic Lake and fished Turtle Pond and Stanawan Bay. Both produced very good fish as well as islands with-in the lake. Check out the fish catch at their website www.pinesunsetlodge.com
