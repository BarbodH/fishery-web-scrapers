521099,Guest,2002-06-11 18:59:00,0,I have been carrying my BC in my wallet for the last 30 Years. Twice coming back in to US I was asked for it. Better safe than sorry. Both times were long before 9/11.
521100,docIN,2002-06-12 09:44:00,120,Thanks all for the info. I think I will play it safe and take the B.C. or at least a notarized copy.Thanks again.
521092,Guest,2002-06-12 10:27:00,0,"A Customs Officer in Canada once told me that a drivers liscense only proves you can drive legally in your state. I know it sounds funny, but technically you need proof of citizenship(passort-birth cert). Non-citizens can get drivers licenses in any state."
521101,docIN,2002-06-19 16:00:00,120,Has anyone had any recent experience with border crossing with or without a Birth Certificate???Thanks again.
521102,Guest,2002-06-19 20:08:00,0,"We went up on 6/8 and came back on 6/15 thru International Falls/Ft Francis. Neither Canadain customs or US customs asked for a birth certificate or drivers license. I was driving my truck and they asked who I was, where I was from and what I was going to do in Canada or what I did in Canada.The Canadian agent was friendly and asked the standard questions on guns, booze and live bait - same as last year. The US agent was more questioning and asked each one of us individually including my 14 year old. Last year I did all the talking for my family and they seemed satisfied.We had the birth certificates, but they never asked for them. It is probably a good idea to take them, even if you do not need them.Fritz"
521093,GR8WTHUNTER,2002-06-23 22:30:00,618,I called Canadian customs before i went last week. The lady that answered the phone told me that they have the right to request your birth certificate or passport to prove citizenship. She told me to have it with us if asked. We were not asked. The boarder gaurd seemed more concerned that we may have guns. Rich
521087,docIN,2002-06-05 07:04:00,120,"I have seen a couple of posts regarding the need for a birth certificate when border crossing. Is this really necessary??? I have yet to be asked for it the last seven years but, I know things have changed since 9/11. Any recent encounters at the border? Thanks for the help."
521088,E_Fish_N_See,2002-06-05 07:18:00,26,"Just bring your passport. That's what I do and then there is no question, unless of course you don't have a passport. Then, bring a birth certificate. I, personally, would not take any chances since 9/11.Mark"
521089,Walleye Wacker,2002-06-05 07:40:00,6,We have made three trips to Canada since 9/11. On one of the trips we were asked for photo ID (drivers lic) and BC or passport. A BC is now on our list of musts. Just got back from Lac Seul and the fishing was great....Good Luck
521090,Guest,2002-06-06 20:16:00,0,"Got back to the U.S. 6/1>Had to show picture ID goining into Canada and was the easiest crossing I have ever had coming back into the USA.Crossed @ Pembina, ND."
521091,Guest,2002-06-07 11:02:00,0,Your dirvers license is all the ID you will need as long as you are a US citizen. TGG
521094,outdoor fanatic,2002-06-08 06:37:00,90,"Just got back 6/1 at Sault St Marie and had not 1 problem going either way. Didn't even ask to see my photo ID. The only thing that was different was a military guy (going back into US) checked out the contents of our pickup bed. That only took about 30 seconds. Was a very smooth experience although I will say to try and avoid the lines where people are traillering boats, they seem to take more time with boats."
521095,Ketchenanny,2002-06-08 07:05:00,38,Just crossed back into the U.S. at Sault St. Marie. Just showed my Michigan license.
521096,balsl6,2002-06-08 21:00:00,426,I cross into canada 5-6 times a year. The Canada customs agenttold me once that if they wanted to they do not have to allow a drivers license if they do not want to? I have never been asked for my birth certifacate though. I have made a copy of my family birth certifacates and just bring them with just in case.If you just tell them the truth and teart them decent you will be fine.
521097,Guest,2002-06-09 09:09:00,0,"I travel to Canada 10-15 times a year and have NEVER been asked for my birth certificate, even since 9/11. They are checking driver's license, although that is also rare.However, an ORIGINAL Birth Certificate (or Passport if you have one) is technically required to get into Canada and back into the States. Therefore, I think it is a good idea to bring one just in case. For people traveling 4+ hours, it is better to be safe than sorry."
521098,Piscatorian,2002-06-09 20:58:00,12,"If you are flying, they always ask for a birth certificate, at least when I have cleared customs through Winnipeg, Edmonton, or Toronto."
