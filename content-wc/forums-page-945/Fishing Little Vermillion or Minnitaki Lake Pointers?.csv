At that time a lot of Muskies were caught around the mouth of Ament Bay, Muskie Pasture (reef area just after the narrows going into the main body from Ojibway Park) and the bay just west of the private cabins (west of Ament Bay- listed on some old maps as Kennaly Lodge-not sure of the spelling).Caught nice smallmouth from Ament Bay west to the point with the most western private cabin. Also did well around Dog Island and Twin Falls. We caught the smallies on original Rapalas and Mepps Comets.Let me know if those cabins are still there. I have lots of good memories from those cabins."

Everybody goes to Red Pine Bay for Walleyes, got a 6.3 lbs. eye out of there last year. Everbody says Southwest Bay is the place for giant Pike. 15 lbs is my best so far. 4 lbs. plus Smallmouth can be caught off of reefs or anywhere you find fist sized rocks. I use nothing but top-water poppers. When are you going? Pickerel Arm Camp is the best resort around, I highly reccommend it!"

521717,Karl,2002-06-22 19:18:00,63,"On Little Vermillion - the two big reefs near Twin Falls hold muskie and smallmouth. So does the reef near the portage to Closs Lake. The ""pasture"" is done already, don't bother. On Minnitaki - very late spawn this year. English River and Redpine Bay will be stacked with walleye for the next couple weeks yet. Also East Bay and Rice River. Look for all the boats."
521718,Guest,2002-06-22 21:26:00,0,Take alot of crawlers and some leeches. There are alot of other places than the community spots mentioned. A jig and leech/crawler at any place with fist to head sized boulders will usually get you smallies and/or walleyes.

521719,Guest,2002-06-24 10:54:00,0,Thank you guys for the info-- We will be going up 6/28! I heard due to the rain and temp drop a week or so ago that the spawn was again delayed from hitting the peak. I am hoping to catch that spawn as I think the prime time has to be this week and some of last week. I am guessing at this point. best of luck fishing
