521785,Guest,2002-06-24 11:08:00,0,Can anybody tell me what the going rate is for a pound of leeches in Canada? I have heard a couple reports that the price has gone up quite a bit. Heard from one guy he paid $60/lb american for 1 lb of leeches. Is this true?
521786,Guest,2002-06-24 12:15:00,0,That is a big jump from the $16 US I paid in May. Call Rainy Lake Baits in Fort Francis 1-807-274-6429. Let us know what you find out. TGG
