Did well trolling large cranks for the musky. Bring heavy weight for the Walleye. The current can be swift and that's where you catch them. We used 2 oz. pencil weights with a normal Lindy setup. Caught the big walleyes that way. Got keep it near the bottom. Are you taking your own boat or renting theirs? Get the upgrade if your renting theirs it's totally worth it. Took my own last year, but my buddies upgraded and had good luck. Hope this helps. If you want anymore details e-mail me at [email protected]"
