We would prefer to buy our beer in Canada. Any suggestions on where to stop? (Do they even allow beer sales at this hour?) Thanks in advance for any suggestions."
521693,Trophymuskie,2002-06-21 04:55:00,254,You would not believe how funny that question is. Even tho I realise you never have been to Quebec before but you see the province of Quebec allows their corner stores to sell beer. So anywhere you can buy smokes and gas you will find beer.Keep releasing them allRichard Collinhttp://www.trophymuskiecharters.com

Beer and local ciders, along with a limited selection of wines, are available in supermarkets and ""dépanneurs"" (convenience stores).Store business hours Most stores are open from 9:30 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Monday to Friday and from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Saturday, and noon to 5:00 p.m. Sunday. Some may be closed on Sunday or after 6:00 p.m. Monday to Wednesday.There is a large supermarket at a mall on the left hand side as you come into Maniwaki on the main drag. There's also a good restaurent there if you need breakfast. I've stopped there many times on my way into a trout outfitter. Jay"
521694,Guest,2002-06-22 12:52:00,0,"I guess my question did seem a bit preposterous. I have fished Quebec for twenty or so years but, believe it or not, the only time we've ever purchased beer has been either at camp or on our way out in the middle of the day. I once spent two months in Maniwaki one weekend with car trouble. Believe me, I bought (and drank) beer. I guess my question (which seems to have been answered) really was: How early in the morning can the stores legally sell the stuff. Thanks for your reply. Hope you have as much fishing in Quebec as I do. (I can't believe how little play the Quebec walleye fishery gets on this sight and elsewhere. Let's keep it our secret.)"
