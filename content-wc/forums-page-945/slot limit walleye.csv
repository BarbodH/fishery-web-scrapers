521132,Guest,2002-06-05 18:59:00,0,I just returned from esnagi lake In wawa.There was a 16 -22 inch slot for walleye this year.Was just wondering if lake makes these slots or is it teritorial slots. Seemed hard to find fish below and above.
521133,Wawajake,2002-06-06 07:12:00,413,"It the whole MNR region that has these limits imposed (most of North eastern Ontario regions I think too)Yes it is an awkward slot arrangement, I have not had to deal with before now. I wonder how many foul hooked or deep caught fish will end up dieing anyway after release when one is just looking for a couple for shore lunch etc. jake"

521136,Guest,2002-06-07 19:07:00,0,"Just came back from Chapleau area and didn't have a problem with the under 16"" fish but couldn't find one over 22"", everyone in our group got the limit under but no overs. Don't have a problem with the slot as it should keep the fish around for future."
521139,outdoor fanatic,2002-06-08 06:32:00,90,"Just came back from Lake Kabinakigami last week and they had the slot limit there as well. I was lucky enough to catch 2 26"". Out of 40 people at the lodge, I think only 4 over the 22"" slot were boated. I do know that at one of the other camps at the lake, some guys had 10 fish in their possession that were in the slot range and they were fined $120 per fish. The MNR is patroling this pretty hard but no one at our camp had any problems. I do think that the slot range is a great idea so as to keep the natural resources thriving. We only had 2 in our group and we only had to take a couple of fish to feed us, so the slot was never really a problem. Although I'll admit that it was hard to look at a 20"" walleye and start thinking about the meal you could have and then have to throw it back, it was nice knowing you were doing your part to keep the population thriving."

521140,Ray,2002-06-12 17:55:00,96,"Marc noticed you fished ""Kaby"" lake friend and I booked a trip for Aug. at pine portage what should we expect fishing size/numbers. Also what size/color jigs work the best any info would be appreciated."
521141,outdoor fanatic,2002-06-12 19:51:00,90,"Ray,You should like it pretty well. Never fished it during the fall, only during the spring. But, I'll let you know what worked in spring and you can go from there. 1/8 oz jigs worked well with either chartreuse or pink heads and just about any tail worked but white, yellow, and pink tails worked great. Also tip the jig with a minnow and you should do okay. We used salted and live minnows and did fine with either but that late in the year I would recommend only live minnows. We never use worms up there but I'm sure they would work. Also did well trolling the shoreline in 6-10' feet of water with crawler harnesses with two hooks and a minnow attached. Troll as slow as you can possibly go in your boat and put enough weight on that it's bouncing off the bottom and we did well in this setup. Landed 2 26"" walleye while we were there. Got 1 jigging and 1 trolling. If you are looking for big northern, I would suggest boot bay. Saw a 36"", 39"" and 41"" taken within 2 hours from boot bay. All were taken trolling. Any more questions, e-mail me at [email protected]. Good luck."
