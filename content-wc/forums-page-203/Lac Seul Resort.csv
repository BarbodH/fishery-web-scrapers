5354225,Slim03,2017-02-24 16:56:00,159,Has anyone stayed at Lac Seul Resort? http://www.lacseulresort.com/homeI can't seem to find much information or reviews on it. Just wondering about the quality of the cabins.
5354425,Catfish Nuggets,2017-02-24 18:29:00,21,"Beautiful location but terribly run down cabins. On queens land so wiring and plumbing are scary too. Really, really nice location though and good for harboring your boat."
5354513,Slim03,2017-02-24 18:55:00,159,Thanks wanted some honest feedback. Location and price caught my eye but wasn't sure what the place may be like. Was suspicious when there were not really any photos of the cabins.

AC/heat if needed, stove, 2 refrigerators, freezer, shower, TV, Wifi. Staff does simple cleaning every day. Been there every summer since 2005 and have not had problems. Would not stay anywhere else."

5367226,prov1800,2017-03-01 12:20:00,5010,Just would like to comment here.there seems to be two lodges mentioned here and personally not sure about the condition of lac suel resort but lac suel lodge is on the west side of the lake and is very well kept camp.with great equip.
5367426,Catfish Nuggets,2017-03-01 13:26:00,21,"To clarify my previous post regarding Lac Seul Resort, it is run down but has all the amenities. The showers were gross, some floors are rotten, and there was a dead and dehydrated chipmunk under our couch. Ok for a bunch of guys but I would not recommend for families. Overall, a good value but you should know what to expect.I have no idea what Lac Seul Lodge is like."
5367450,prov1800,2017-03-01 13:37:00,5010,Hard to beat.
5367874,ToddHunky,2017-03-01 17:07:00,4,I am guessing you didnt stay at Lac Seul Lodge class act place cant wait to get back again
