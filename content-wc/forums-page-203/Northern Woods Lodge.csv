1358926,Guest,2011-10-18 16:53:00,0,"I hope you get some responses. I was considering going there this past year also. It appears they have nice boats, and easy lake to get around and nice cabin facilities."
5359929,Rls825,2017-02-26 19:37:00,9,Did either of you go to Northern Woods Lodge north of Terrace Bay ? What did you think ? How was the fishing ? Thanks
5360033,wallydave,2017-02-26 20:07:00,2151,Try the search function on the tool bar. Good luck! Try Google too!
5360057,Rls825,2017-02-26 20:18:00,9,Not sure what that means. Does this refer to Northern Woods Lodge ?
5360993,wallydave,2017-02-27 08:40:00,2151,If anyone has posted about Northern Woods you could see if the trip went well. It's a nice feature. Give it a try.

Per chance, he might have been referencing the ""search"" function. If so, this is a great tool to find information across many different forums at once.Kindest regards....."

5362417,yoopertrout,2017-02-27 17:06:00,1172,"I've been there twice. The first time was unseasonably cold, and the fishing was mediocre. The second time the weather was normal and fishing was below mediocre. I know two other people who went and experienced mediocre fishing, but they also both went the year when it was very cold.The facilities were nice, the boats were nice, the food was very good and plentiful (It was American Plan back then), but the fishing was so so. It isn't fair for me to judge the fishing based on two trips, one of which happened in really cold weather. Maybe it's great sometimes. I was ready to try something else though.If you have questions, please p.m. me."
5363386,Rls825,2017-02-27 21:02:00,9,"Thanks Yoopertrout. I have fished out of Flint Wilderness, Twin Lakes and a couple of lakes near Wawa and Chapleau. We wanted to give Northern Woods on Long Lake a try. We were thinking of going May 28- .That is a big lake. Do you know how anyone else has done there ? And if not Northern Woods is there drive to camp between White River and Upsala, Jellicoe and Hearst that you would recommend ? THANKS !"
