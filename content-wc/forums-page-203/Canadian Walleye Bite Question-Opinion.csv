5353913,dkrusin,2017-02-24 13:23:00,97,"Contrary to popular believe, Walleye are bottom feeders. They do swarm and go after schools of minnows but they also feed off the bottom of the lake where they find crawfish, bugs, leeches and snails. Walleyes are very sensitive to light and on bright sunny days they go deeper but also look down at the bottom of the lake to minimize the amount of light in their eyes. With this mind, try dragging your jig on bottom. Drag it through the muck and guck and just every couple of feet jig it off the bottom to clean it off a little. You will be amazed how the Walleyes grab it off the bottom."
5355025,pjshorthorn,2017-02-25 06:07:00,5654,"A couple of techniques that I have found to be pretty consistent when jigging are to do what you described.....purposely.hop the jig along the bottom or allow the jig to hop along the bottom while backtrolling or drifting. One caveat is that I have used varying sizes of a floating jighead with an egg sinker above a barrel swivel when back trolling or drifting. The egg sinker tends to bounce off the bottom giving the jighead and minnow an erratic movement while the jighead stays suspended a foot so above the bottom. On weighted jigs, I prefer to fish them when I can find shallow flats that drop off into deeper water quickly. Depending on the spot, I'll anchor either on the flat or in deeper water. If anchored on the flat, I cast into deeper water......hopping the jig back up the drop with slight twitches and an occasional strong snap of the rod tip . If anchoring in deeper water, I'll cast onto the flat and hop the jig back into deeper water allowing the jig to drop while releasing more line ,a small portion at a time, and using more of a vertical jigging presentation. With this method, I keep the bail open on a spinning reel and use my fingertip to release line and/or detect bites. I have never kept notes on which method has been more successful for myself,but I would venture to say that the majority of larger fish caught have been using a floating jighead while drifting or backtrolling.

5340201,Sportdog,2017-02-17 19:20:00,6735,Last year the following scenario happened while fishing for eyes in Canada. Fishing a narrows with slight current. Started out drifting a slip bobber rig with minnow that I am sure was 6-12 inches off the bottom. No takers. Started casting and hopping a jig and minnow........Bingo! Started catching. 28 fow in mid spring. Think they wanted more active presentation to turn on? Comments and theories welcome.
5340209,bigwalleye1,2017-02-17 19:26:00,2632,"I generally start on the other end of the spectrum, with a jib and minnow, but a heavy jig, 3/8 or even 1/2 an oz, and go fast. I'm trying to get the reactionary bite and slow down and lighten up when the fast presentation doesn't work."
5340217,phishfearme,2017-02-17 19:28:00,1242,"typically walleye are on the bottom looking up for prey - you can argue that fishing right on the bottom works but in my experience fishing 2-3 feet off the bottom - maybe even a bit more - is where the action is. in that deep of water though I would bet that the fish were a bit more off the bottom than a foot or so - would not however consider these suspended as they are still oriented with the bottom - so being 4-5 ft off the bottom would be where the action is. suspended walleye - that is not bottom oriented - is a different story as the action here would be anywhere around them - up, down, left, right, back, front. phish"
5340249,Sportdog,2017-02-17 19:40:00,6735,Mmmmm.... I just may have been fishing underneath them. Hadn't thought of that. Thanks!
5340721,mickr,2017-02-18 07:32:00,74,"I am not a big fan of fishing something relatively weightless in current. With a slip bobber I am assuming you were fishing relatively weightless? You can't really control the direction the minnow is facing so while it is drifting down it may be twisting or drifting tail first and that is unnatural. With the jig and the cast, you know the direction the minnow is facing and that can be a difference maker."
5343121,retire55,2017-02-19 15:00:00,1029,"If your sonar is set up properly, you should be able to assure yourself that you're not fishing under the fish. Secondly, hopping a jig along the bottom, besides being more active than a slip bobber rig, can turn up debris off the bottom which can generate interest."
5343866,Bill Krejca,2017-02-20 06:10:00,6107,"My suspicion would be that the bobber could have been causing a restriction of the bait to position toward the bottom, such that the bait was actually being held higher up in the water column (a broad swing with the bobber as the fulcrum point). That is, the bait maybe wasn't on the bottom/close enough to the bottom. I'd guess the other presentation with the jig was riding right on/ closer to the bottom. Just have to try a variety of presentations (if bobber is desired to be used, use a larger bobber with a correspondingly much heavier sinker).Bill"
5344953,Aspencreek,2017-02-20 16:17:00,2911,"I was thinking the same thing, I use a 1/6 or 1/8 oz jig head under a slipbobber, that way it hangs under the bobber and not drifting with the currents. If you want to use just a hook then I put on a split shot above it. If no takers at the bottom, I move my bobber set up until the action starts. I will also retrieve my set up SLOOOwLY to spark some action and reset."
5346241,MrSimon,2017-02-21 06:58:00,922,I find that lake walleye who are choosing to be in current are actively feeding. A more aggressive approach always does better.
5353649,walleyehunt13,2017-02-24 11:27:00,10,Have you ever tried a drop shot?
