They will tell you more about things you didn't really ask about .....LOL. Fun place !!!! PjShorthorn
5350481,1/4 oz Jig,2017-02-22 20:08:00,90,Anyone have any spots they stop for a Friday night fish fry on the way up to Canada along rte 53? We usually make a stop at culvers then eat dinner at either the border bar or chocolate moose. There has to be somewhere between Duluth and I-Falls that has a decent fish fry!

5350577,1/4 oz Jig,2017-02-22 20:30:00,90,I agree but I can't make a shore lunch on the road!
5350721,lama231,2017-02-22 23:09:00,29,The Sawmill in Virginia has a Friday fish fry. They also have a large pizza a pound of wings and a pitcher of beer or pop for 25 bucks
5352969,team walleye,2017-02-24 06:40:00,336,That is true... I hope you find a good place!
5353041,pjshorthorn,2017-02-24 07:13:00,5654,"The Sawmill in Virginia is a good place to eat. If you forgot any last minute tackle items, you can stop in at the Lucky Seven gas station just north of the Sawmill on the right. They have a small tackle shop on one side with a decent selection of jigs,etc.... Years ago we would also grab a bite to eat in Orr,MN at T Patten's cafe. Not sure if they have a fish fry on Friday's, but lunches were good with homemade pies to choose from. They may have a menu online that you could check out. Safe travels and tip a beer for me if you stop at The Border Bar. I love that joint. There has been a few fisherman that have gotten snaked up in that place on their way for a fishing trip.

We no longer have KFC up in my end of the yoop, and I eat it twice a year, when traveling to Nestor Falls, along Highway 53 in Virginia, or across the border in Fort Frances.Seems sacrilegious to eat fish on the road when we will be eating it twice a day for the next week, in the most beautiful setting in the world."
5358209,yoopertrout,2017-02-26 09:08:00,1172,Another vote for the Sawmill.
5360097,1/4 oz Jig,2017-02-26 20:42:00,90,Looks like I might have to give sawmill a try. Always seems packed when we drive by. I'm sure I'll still have some time to throw one back at Border Bar for you PJ! I like to do shore lunches while in Canada but I maybe do 2-3 max in a week. It takes a good amount of time that i could spend fishing.
