I've seen guys say it is good if you know where to go and I've seen a lot of people say otherwise. It can be hit and miss. Beautiful place though .you might try asking this question on http://www.fish-hawk.net/the majority of the traffic on fish hawk is coming from eastern Ontario anglers."

They have a good website but beyond that I have had some contact with a group that has fished it early the last two years. Its a water supply lake that is drawn down as the summer progresses. I've been on lakes where this happens and am usually told that this concentrates the fish and makes them easier to catch. Bull*. It messes with the forage base, notably crayfish and water insects and disorients the game fish population that are now looking for different structure. Maybe if I trolled a big net, which would be illegal, would be the way to go. The early season fishing for walleye and pike is quite good and shallow. There are lots of bass and they adapt through the season. I'm sure there are those that do well on this lake through the season but I'll give it my best this Spring. It's said to be a beautiful lake with almost no development and I'm looking forward to that but frankly, I can get great scenery at my local state park."

One thing I've found is that everyone in that area fish the same techniques time and time again. You can get a map of the lake from MNR. I would make sure you do that and bring a decent locator. I find the walleye very finicky there and our best method to date is slip Bobbering with leeches.

Smallie fishing can be good though. This past summer the water level was REALLY low and the fishing was downright bad. It's a gorgeous lake and a nice lodge. The lodge is under new ownership and they seem to be doing fine with the place. It's the kind of place you go to if you want beautiful scenery and a remote feeling without driving too far .... just don't expect much from the fishing."
