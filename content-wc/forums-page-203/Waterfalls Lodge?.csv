I just can't pull off a 16 hour drive up through International Falls this year due to being a full-time grad student once again and full-time employee. I went to the Indy boat, sport, and travel show and came across a booth for Waterfalls Lodge who seems to offer pretty decent boats and pricing for my daughter and I. We'd be going early July and he said his smallmouth fishing is great and and walleye fishing is average but we could get a boat put on the Spanish River for better walleye fishing. There's little mention here except for some really old negative reviews here about poor fishing, but their reviews on facebook and tripadvisor are pretty good. Anyone hear anything good about the fishing?"

The boats are good, the food was good, the hosts are excellent, the walleye fishing is non-existent, the smallmouth fishing was just ok, they have some remote lakes that are good but it costs you $ to fish em. If you want to catch fish, this is not the place in my opinion."
5361930,forgop,2017-02-27 13:54:00,880,Thanks for the feedback. He was honest about the walleye fishing not being very good and I found a trip focusing on smallies to be the main goal and then hitting up the Spanish River for walleye. The trip excursions on ATV's sounded pretty interesting as well. I'm kinda talking myself out of that one for a couple of other options because I do want to get some numbers. I'd be fine doing a trip for numbers with smallies and then just enough walleye to eat this year.

As previously noted, the other aspects of this camp were ""OK"", though he and his 3 friends basically took boat rides for the 4 days they were at this camp. He fishes NW Ontario (normally) though due to travel and time restraints for his friends, they went to this camp. Wish you well on finding the right camp for your Father & Daughter trip. Rich B"
