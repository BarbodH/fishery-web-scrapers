5347385,btyreprich,2017-02-21 14:37:00,1067,"My insurance agent said that the trailer is covered under your vehicle insurance when hitched up to the tow vehicle. As such, we did not buy the additional coverage.If I remember correctly, there is not a way to padlock the trailer to your tow vehicle. It's still safe - just no lock.If you are worried about the trailer being stolen, I like the idea of a strong chain and lock to a good sized tree. Parking other vehicles around the trailer is another smart move.Reminds me of a camp we used to stay at in far northern Ontario. They would tell us to leave the cars unlocked as the local youth from the reservation would just smash a window if they really wanted to get in your car. That made all of us very nervous. The following year the lodge owner made arrangements to store the cars at a nearby house. Costs $20 to park all week but the peace of mind was worth every penny."
5346489,Iowa4ND,2017-02-21 08:08:00,35,"We are looking at renting a U-haul trailer this year since we have such a large group. I think we will be ok crossing as we will purchase their safetow liability insurance to avoid any hassles at the border, but since we go to a boat in we are a little worried about it sitting in the remote parking area there for a week and getting stolen. Anyone have any insight on comprehensive coverage availability for this type rental? Might just have to roll the dice and give the one guy that is having major heartburn over it some Xanax. Thinking we could unhitch the trailer and try to park the three vehicles around it so at least it would be a difficult job for them to get to the trailer."
5346577,bigwalleye1,2017-02-21 08:19:00,2632,Can't you lock the trailer to the tow vehicle and lock the hitch into the receiver? That's what I do with my boat trailer.
5346617,Iowa4ND,2017-02-21 08:29:00,35,"That's what I am thinking. Back it up to the trees, trailer lock, chain from frame on trailer to truck and then pull other vehicles extremely close. Just wanted to see if anyone had any options. Guy who does alot of the planning is a worry wart and does alot of work for this trip so I thought I'd at least check things out so he could relax."
5346641,pjshorthorn,2017-02-21 08:38:00,5654,"I've never asked, but maybe UHaul offers an lock for rent similar to a boot for vehicles that can be installed on the wheel of the trailer PjShorthorn"
5346705,MrSimon,2017-02-21 08:55:00,922,"If you call Uhaul directly, they can answer most of these questions. Also, all of the Uhaul trailers I've ever rented worked great ... but they didn't have a spare tire. I would never drive over 2,000 miles without at least one. That's something to consider. In my opinion, it makes sense to buy your own small utility trailer. They aren't that expensive, are incredibly handy to have around, and you can outfit them with multiple spare tires, spare hubs/bearings, a tool box, and good sturdy locks. I just checked Craigslist and there were multiple small box trailers in good condition ... prices were right around $1,000 for the nicer ones."
5346809,Iowa4ND,2017-02-21 09:31:00,35,Good point on the spare. Would like to have my own but not in the cards right now but hope to in future. the size of our group this year is double what we usually have - 14 going. so spreading about $315.00 out over that many doesn't add a lot to per person cost. most decent used 5 x 8 enclosed are running around 1500.00 or more on craigslist by me.
5347169,btyreprich,2017-02-21 12:29:00,1067,We have used UHaul trailers for the past several years to haul all of our gear and food up to Canada after selling our boat. Never had a problem crossing the border in either direction. We prefer the smaller enclosed trailer as its the same height as our tow vehicles which means less wind resistance. Not always easy to find these smaller trailers - but they are out there. I did ask Uhaul about a spare tire and the will NOT rent a spare. They insisted it's against company policy for liability issues. They said even in remote Canada there are rental agencies and to just call their main office number anytime of the day for help or to change a flat tire.
5347265,farmnfish,2017-02-21 13:35:00,130,"We did it a bunch of times going on flyins back in the 90s. Had to empty it once for inspection at the border, other than that, no problems.I don't know if they still do but those trailers used to have a sticker that said max 45 mph. We ran them at 70, they never burst into flames."
5347361,Iowa4ND,2017-02-21 14:15:00,35,"Thanks for all the info, did look at Uhaul sites and numerous along the route and at destination. want to make it a mute point and get our own sometime but not in the cards this year."
5347369,bigwalleye1,2017-02-21 14:18:00,2632,"Not to double post, but isn't insurance for the trailer covered by u-haul as part of the rental agreement? If not, wouldn't it be covered by your own vehicle insurance in the event of theft or damage while parked? I do like the idea of parking up to the trees and/or surrounding it with other party vehicles."
1467614,SinOrSwim,2012-07-29 08:55:00,1528,The trailer we normally use to go to Canada isn't available this year so we are looking at our options. Has anyone used UHAUL trailers before and do they allow you over the border with no problems? I would assume they do?They must have changed their policy because it says on-line you can cross but I remember looking into those trailers years ago and they would not allow it over the border. The uhaul people told me that. Just want to see if others have done this to make sure we don't have issues at the border. Thanks
1467645,Obabikon,2012-07-29 10:39:00,2370,I've head guests bring them up without a problem.
1467714,lcwhit,2012-07-29 14:00:00,104,i've seen a couple of them up there. maybe they just didn't tell uhaul where they were going. probably will get you a little extra scrutiny at the border.
1467737,SinOrSwim,2012-07-29 15:14:00,1528,We have thought about that but I have found some rentals locally that are a little more expensive but seem like they might be better options. Cargo trailers. It's nice having everything covered. We used to use a utility trailer with tarps but then it always rains and opening it up for the border people was a pain in the butt.Always easier to take a trailer and decrease the number of vehicles. I'm assuming most people use their boats so don't run into space issues.
1467792,walleye88ia,2012-07-29 17:47:00,35,we pulled a u haul about 12 years ago. crossed at intl. falls. they took everything out and checked it. a hour later they sent us through.
1467808,deputy dog,2012-07-29 18:19:00,305,"We have been doing this for the last 15 yrs. crossed at both buffalo, ny and the Soo with no problems whatsoever. Other than asking what was inside no questions about trailer itself. I do recommend trying to get by with the 5x7 instead of bigger 6x12....the 5x7 is single axel much lighter and taller inside. The 6x12 is double axel much heavier and shorter inside, almost impossible to stand in. The 4x8 is heavier and even lower inside. We paid $220 for 8 days this year at our local dealer. Hope this helped!"
1467881,Hawkfan,2012-07-29 20:34:00,237,"Has anyone that has used UHAUL for this trip ever gotten delayed because of it? I rented a trailer or truck one time to move and couldn't because the unit we were supposed to have had not been returned by the previous renter. And we were offered no discount, etc. So they were able to take the reservation, but not keep the reservation. And what did they care? They probably got to charge the people before us extra for not having it back on the scheduled date and had to give us nothing. So UHAUL leaves a sour taste in my mouth. But this isn't a trip you can really push back a day or so for a reason like this. Has anyone run into this before?"
1467891,5thsuit,2012-07-29 21:13:00,54,"We rented one in 2002, 2004 and 2006 and had no problem crossing the border. We did however fail to secure the door and lost a rod case and 3 dozen eggs out the back about 20 miles from Dryden. Never found then rod case but amazingly 3 dozen eggs survived the fall. Could have been worse if we hadn't stopped to take a leak. The rough road popped the door lever!"
1467989,SinOrSwim,2012-07-30 07:55:00,1528,I worry about this too. I rented a truck years and years ago and they didn't have the one I rented. Ended up getting a bigger one for the same cost but was lucky they had a bigger truck. They say they guarantee it on the website but then say they will give you a $50 credit if they don't have it.
1468088,UKBDM,2012-07-30 11:38:00,178,Have pulled a small enclosed trailer through Int'l Falls almost every year from 1997 thru 2009. Rented the first few years then BIL bought one.Told rental place that we were crossing into Canada so they provided proof of insurance along with the registration. No additional charge.Never been asked to open up the trailer. Not once! These were small 6'x8' or 6' x10' trailers so I don't know if that made a difference or not.
