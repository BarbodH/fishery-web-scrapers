5361257,team walleye,2017-02-27 10:00:00,336,Great post. I have some great memories with my dad and uncle on our Canada trips. I am fortunate enough that we are still doing it. Hopefully in a few years I will get to start taking my kids as well. I sent you a PM about a trip!
5363090,andreindy,2017-02-27 19:54:00,308,Hung phone up a few minutes ago. Just put my deposit down on O'Sullivan's Rainbow Lodge for 7/8 through 7/15. Felt earth shift its axis slightly. I'm feeling lighter. Thank you to all who understood and encouraged.
5363506,pjshorthorn,2017-02-27 21:48:00,5654,"That is great news.!!!! I bet it feels good to have the first step in place for a great family trip. You may want to touch base with Bill Krecja as he is the Jedi master of fishing out of O'Sullivan Rainbow Lodge. Heck, he may be scheduled for the same time you are going. There are a ton of folks who can offer suggestions and ideas on planning for the trip so don't be bashful asking for help. Best of luck and let us know how your trip turns out PjShorthorn"
5363666,kzoofisher,2017-02-28 03:20:00,5144,"Congrats. Now you can start a thread about what gear and food to take. There'll be a thousand responses, all of them correct. In my mind the two most important things are staying dry and keeping bug bites to a minimum. Stay comfortable and everything else is gravy."
5363730,martinbns,2017-02-28 05:14:00,1520,"I read this thread and think to myself, I am that guy too.I am 53, son is 29, daughter 23, they live two provinces away, see them a couple of times a year, both have careers that are working out for them.When I see my kids now as adults which is not as often as we would like our relationship has changed, one thing that really stands out of the number of times they repeat things we told them as children or young adults that have become guiding principles of their lives that we may not have really thought were that important.I wish we could spend more time together, when they were young we missed very few hockey games or singing exhibitions, but we did work a lot. Enjoy your kids, but don't beat yourself up. We are pretty proud of the work ethic we have instilled in both of ours. Life skills they will need forever."
5364330,Fishoil,2017-02-28 09:15:00,1277,"Congratulations!! You will be making memories that will last a lifetime. I cherish the memories of my father and all those Canadian adventures I took him on. He was pretty much the same as you until I started taking him fishing in my mid-twenties. I lost him last year, along with the father of a good friend who I fished with often but will always have the memories. You'll get lots of great advice here so I'll just suggest this: take LOTS of pictures on your trip. Let me know if I can help you out with anything."
5364594,Guest,2017-02-28 11:23:00,0,"Wow. The OP made me want to walk out of work right this minute...Like most folks here, it seems, I have work/life balance issues (among my many issues!), and I remember some of the best (and, honestly, worst) times of my youth going fishing with dad--just the two of us, camped on an island somewhere on the Mississippi river, near Onalaska. Wanted something like that for my son and I, and found that we could do Canada for less than the camping trip. We'll make our 8th trip in a few months. Generally have to work myself half to death the week before and the week after the trip...and I have zero regrets about it. It is so worth it!!! A follow-up to the earlier suggestion about taking lots of pictures: put them as your screen-saver on your computer at work. Having a rough day? Let the slideshow bring you back to a better time/place. I find it very helpful on ""those"" days... Great OP! -42"
5365450,kzoofisher,2017-02-28 15:35:00,5144,"Is it possible to look back and think you spent enough time with your kids? I don't think so, they just grow too darn fast. Do what you can and cherish the time so when the relationship changes it becomes different but not worse ."
5356345,Pooch,2017-02-25 15:41:00,4618,"""Cats in the Cradle"" applies to most men who bust our butts most of our lives then realize what we missed out on. I think we (men) are hard wired to produce for our families protection. Don't be so hard on yourself because we all did what we felt had to be done because it was the right thing at the time.Don't judge the past by today's standards or values. How will what we are doing today be judged in the future? What is ""right"" today may be horribly frowned upon a generation or two from today.Yes, every time I hear that song I feel guilt, but the past is just that... the past.Pooch"
5356385,3M TA3,2017-02-25 15:53:00,2846,"Seems like just a blink of the eyes I was 40. Phew. Life is like a roll of toilet paper. The more you use it, the faster it goes. Carpe Diem."
5356497,Carnhzkr,2017-02-25 17:10:00,964,"Since you're using the toilet paper and Allergy, I think you mean ""Crape diem""."
5356969,bigdaddyguns,2017-02-25 19:23:00,608,"I had the same dream of Canada and when my boys got into their teen years we began trips to Canada. The trips have brought us lifelong shared memories and enjoyment that we bring up it seems every few days whether its reminiscing about shore lunches, drinking Molson, smoking ""Cuban"" cigars, or other laughs/jokes that live on. Not sure how much longer our trips will go on as they are nearing the end of college but the memories we have made so far are something we will always have between us. Kudos on pulling the trigger on this trip and I hope you find that same level of satisfaction and I think they will wipe out any regrets you have at the moment. Enjoy!"
5357049,SDP,2017-02-25 19:48:00,27,"I read an article this past week written by a dad who's teenage daughter was killed in a car accident on her way home several years ago. He relayed how he spent years paralyzed by living the ""what if"" life. What if he had done any number of things differently, maybe his daughter would still be alive. Only after he started living the ""what is"" life could he start making his life have meaning again. Kudos to Cats in the cradle for recognizing it's not to late to make an impact for good on his family. This is coming from a guy who's worked 50 - 60 hours a week for the last 20 years and my kids are all adults and moved away. We all have regrets of what we should have done differently but I'm glad you have recognized it while you can still do something about it. Enjoy time with your kids"
5357961,Mojo-NC,2017-02-26 07:46:00,1929,"Thanks for posting this - very touching indeed. I grew up in IL and have fond memories of fishing up in Northern WI every year. One year when I was 14 or 15 years old, I was fishing with my uncle and we were using a row boat. After rowing around the lake all morning he pulled out a couple of cold meat loaf sandwiches for our lunch. I don't remember a sandwich ever tasting that good. My uncle is gone now, but to this day whenever my wife makes a meat loaf I save some for a sandwich to take fishing and as I eat it I think of that day fishing with my uncle."
5360065,Multispecies Guy,2017-02-26 20:24:00,447,Awesome post. I wish you well; family is wealth.
5360225,Rich B,2017-02-26 21:38:00,1081,"Along with the OP, these replies are what makes WC my favorite fishing board....."
5360649,Bill Krejca,2017-02-27 07:00:00,6107,"The memories of family and friends in the north woods get retold many times, both verbally and mentally; victories on the job, not so much. The time north spent with my late father and my son, both separately, and collectively, had to be the epitome of life's blessings! Go for it!! Bill"
5360753,BornToFish,2017-02-27 07:35:00,1224,"Greetings,The Original Post resonated with me. I wanted to reply to the thread, but couldn't think of anything to say that hadn't already been said. I decided to reply any ways after reading the two preceding posts by Rich and Bill. Thank you gentlemen.Kindest regards...."
5355585,andreindy,2017-02-25 09:42:00,308,"I joined Walleye Central in 2004 when my son (my firstborn) was 4 years old. I absolutely enjoyed fishing, although I rarely fished at all. Sometimes once a year, sometimes not. Honestly, my ""fishing time"" was almost entirely thinking of the place it had had in my life and its connection to the absolute fondest childhood memories I have. Fishing had brought together people I loved in places I loved. To this day, I still cannot encounter a bullhead without thinking of my Grandpa and how thankful and happy he was to have caught them. And how my Grandma appeared less happy to cook them, but always did. I joined Walleye Central in 2004 because I wanted to learn and it was my time to share with my son. There were promises I made to him. One, that I would always have raspberries growing in the yard, and two, that there were adventures ahead with wind and water and wondering (hopefully), when we would have another one. I'm here to say I didn't keep my promise. Where has the time gone? I laugh and am saddened by this. If anyone should know better, it was me. I work in healthcare and Old Timers in their hospital bed often shared a common directive to me: Go and Do. Take your boy. Life is short. Seize the day. And I didn't. My life was work and I let everything else get in the way. My son can now grow a beard. And mine is now gray. I'm here to say I am going to keep that promise. And I am back on Walleye Central after a 12 year absence. That amazing son of mine has waited and asked...he is still waiting to catch his first walleye...ever. Seize the day folks. My work can wait. My spreadsheets can wait. My proposals and projects can wait. Cleaning my basement can wait. Cashing out vacation time instead of taking it is done. I have time to prevent regret and change the course of my life. Canada was the dream I had when I was a boy. It was a dream I always had really and I'm done dreaming. We don't know where we are going or when yet, but **** or high water, we will be in Ontario, Canada sometime this June, July or August. And I'm bringing my Dad and Brother. And I am smiling as I am typing this because it feels so good to just put your **** foot down on the craziness of life and just make something happen. Thank you to all of you. I have begun reading your posts and trying to make decisions on where to go and who has availability. But I WILL go. I've given myself a week to figure it all out. I will be smart and thoughtful, but no longer than a week to seal the deal. Thank you Walleye Central for being here and being a source of inspiration and motivation to me. Seize the day my friends."
5355625,pjshorthorn,2017-02-25 10:01:00,5654,Good for you !!!! I've been there and done that........the career thing......I understand completely. I have been blessed to have had three generations in the boat together a number of times over the years. Hopefully I have a few more in the future. Those are some of the best memories I have of trips to Canada and I'm sure you will as well. Take a lot of pictures .......they will be a great way to remember your time with your family in an amazing setting. Allow yourself to completely unplug while you are on our your trip....you and your family will appreciate it a bunch . Trust me. PjShorthorn
5355641,kzoofisher,2017-02-25 10:04:00,5144,"Good for you. Start now and take his kids with you as soon as he has some. I'm working another Saturday, been that kind of winter, but I'm saving enough to really have some fun this summer. We hired another guy so I'm pretty confident he'll be 100% in the loop by then and I can fish 'til my arm hurts. It does go by way too fast."
5355729,Fishoil,2017-02-25 10:38:00,1277,Check your PM's. I just sent you one.
5355929,stjoeguy,2017-02-25 12:41:00,979,Welcome back! Thank you for a very thoughtful post. I hope you and your son can make it to Canada this year.
5355937,That Minnesota guy,2017-02-25 12:59:00,8293,Some of my fondest memories are a couple of times I got to fish with dad before life grabbed me and he passed away.
5355945,Mike Borger,2017-02-25 13:03:00,1554,"That's a topic that's close to my heart and I was moved by what you wrote.Here's to better days ahead for you and your son, it's never too late."
5355961,Rich B,2017-02-25 13:17:00,1081,"Kudo's to you for recognizing where you and your family are now in life, your prior promises, and waking up in time to make great memories up north that you and your kids will carry with you the rest of your lives. A very good friend of mine (a wise attorney - no, that's not an oxymoron - ha) has said he has found that there are 2 keys to happiness in this life: 1) having good memories with loved ones and friends to cherish and think back upon..... 2) having good activities and events to look forward to.....at any stage in one's life..... As I believe with most of the folks here on WC, some of the best memories are of being north of the border and fishing out on the water with family and good friends. Congrats on ""seizing the day"".....wishing you the best with your planning and this special trip. Faith, Family, Friends.....and Fishing, Rich B"
5356265,Aspencreek,2017-02-25 14:59:00,2911,"The first time I went to Canada was with my father and uncle and cousin. 16' row boats with smoky 20hps, But what a time we had, knew nothing about what we were doing, completely unaware and ill equipped. Rained for 3 straight days and were drenched for all of them, I have pictures that remind us how miserable it was, but we still had a great time. 20 yrs. later my dad decides it's time for a guys week in Canada again, myself, dad, brother and brother in law. Again completely in the dark, but we still caught fish, well he did, I remember him sitting in the front of the boat dropping his jig over the side saying ""fish on"" while I tried everything else in my tackle box, all with a S!*t eating grin on his face. We made reservations to come back the next year in June before we left, dad died in Nov. of that year. So now, the first trip out on the water, I take a flask of Weisers, my boat partner and I head out and stop by his favorite spot, toast to POP's and the fishing Gods, and do our best the rest of the week."
5356313,Moosebunk,2017-02-25 15:23:00,211,"Not an everyday kinda post you'd read on a fishing board but, one of the more memorable and thoughtful posts for sure. Seize the days ahead dood!"
