5356081,Bstar,2017-02-25 14:05:00,564,I haven't stayed at the Plaza motel but we have stayed at the Super 8 on the Canada side and it was fairly new and very clean with a lot of restaurants in the area. That was in 2013. Things could change in 4 years. I always check the reviews at tripadvisor.com whenever I'm searching for someplace to stay. Good luck.

Have stayed there 3 times and will again this year on way to Nakina and then on return home. Ask for Rebecca and tell her Dave Kean recommended the motel."

Room was very clean, and plenty of parking for my boat. I would give it a rating of an 8 out of 10 for the reasonable cost, with a decent TV, good bed and mattress, small fridge and a good location.....it is an older motel, though the rooms have updated decor (not my style, though only staying for an evening and I basically want a clean room in a safe area - it is located directly across the road from the MI State Patrol). No breakfast is offered in the morning, though that's no big deal for us. Family run operation and very well kept. Am planning on staying there again in June, and booking 2 rooms as our daughter and her husband are joining us for this year's trip up north. Rich B"
