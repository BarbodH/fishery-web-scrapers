5353377,BornToFish,2017-02-24 09:18:00,1224,"Greetings Randy,I had a few more thoughts come to mind. The mid-lake structure that I fish for northern pike during August and early September are the same rock humps that walleye guys are fishing for walleyes. During this timeframe, small mouth bass tend to inhabit the tops of the rock humps, while walleyes are along the sides of the rock hump, slightly deeper than the bass.The northern pike are out on these rock humps eating walleyes and bass. They will be above the thermocline just hanging out. They might be fifteen feet down in the water column, over fifty feet of water, but only one or two casts away from the rock hump. I found that it's important to get my lure down around 10-12 feet or so and just move it along.The pike see my lure silhouetted against the surface. Sometimes the pike sneak up on the lure from behind such that I barely feel a tick when they overtake the lure. Sometimes they T-bone the lure. When it's the latter type of strike, you will want to be hanging on to the rod with a firm grip and use a ferocious hook set to pull the lure through the fish's teeth.I encourage you and your buddies to have good release tools and the knowledge/confidence to use them. It's intimidating when you look at a pike with a big lure such as a Bulldawg and leader entirely within its mouth.I've caught hundreds of pike with this approach. There tend to be windows throughout the day when the pike are active. You might make some drifts now and have nothing to show for it. Then, come back in two hours and you catch five pike. Give this pattern a solid try and you will likely be pleased with the results.Good fishing and tight lines!!"

5353497,MrSimon,2017-02-24 10:16:00,922,"Don't forget to test water temp when you arrive. Temperature and food supply are everything!! In lakes that stay cool year round, the common adage of ""summer pike go deep"" doesn't apply. A few years back we fished Quantz lake in late August. Every single pike over 35"" came out of 10' of water or less. Many of the 40+ giants came out of only a few feet of water."
5345017,fldoc1,2017-02-20 16:51:00,69,We have a fisherman that loves to cast. Jigging and trolling for short periods are fine but casting is his love. We have fished in shallow bays after ice out with success - central Manitoba lakes. We are wondering if there are lakes in Ontario west of Nipigon where in August and September we would have a fair chance of catching bigger northerns. Randy from Duluth
5345105,Multispecies Guy,2017-02-20 17:31:00,447,I've never been there but I have a trip Sept 2-9 to Shoal Lake for SM bass and pike. There is one lodge on the lake but there are boats from a couple resorts on LOTW that also fish Shoal. Walleye fishing is prohibited but the bass and pike fishing are reported to be very good. Check out http://shoallakelodge.net
5345145,Golden Eagle,2017-02-20 17:44:00,2642,"August and September are good for big pike. So are July and October.Cast the cabbage. Fish above, in and downstream of moving water. Find walleyes off edge of humps, move into slightly shallower water and cast for pike. Pike have found walleyes before you got there.Last July we marked several large pike and caught several large pike that were between the walleyes and top of the hump. It was not unusual to mark 2 or 3 large pike in 10-12 fow. Walleyes were in 14-16 fow. Top of hump was 5-8'.I like fishing the new moon in August, but my 8 year old grandson will be in school. We'll be fishing the July 15 week. Early October is also in play this season. Will also fish 10 days beginning May 17."
5346217,MrSimon,2017-02-21 06:55:00,922,"Deep weed lines in 8-12 feet of water can be killer summer time pike spots .... just make sure you are casting lures that get down deep enough. Also, if you can find a hump or sunken island that has weed growth on top .... that's like summer time pike heaven. Personally, for casting summer pike, I like lakes on the smaller side that aren't too deep. In lakes like that, the big pike tend to be mixed in with the medium and even small ones ..... unlike in big deep lakes where the big pike all go deep and are hard to catch while casting."
5346265,fldoc1,2017-02-21 06:59:00,69,I did take a look at Shoal Lake after reading about it in a previous post. It is a possibility although the rest of us like fishing for and eating walleyes. In response to Golden Eagle from Tennessee where do you typically fish for northerns and walleyes. As a side note my brother and his friend that loves to cast (the person that is the reason for this post) are from the Memphis area. We have been fishing together in Canada once a summer for many years. They really look forward to it. Randy from Duluth
5346369,Baseline,2017-02-21 07:25:00,3207,English River north of Kenora holds good populations of larger northerns. Lac Suel is good too.
5348161,bassnblast,2017-02-21 19:58:00,56,Lac Seul in September is amazing for big walleye and big northern -- highly recommend!
5348201,pike50plus,2017-02-21 20:16:00,584,"http://www.canadafishingguide.net/reports/fly-in-trips/I also have fished mostly later Mid-July to 2nd week of aug up that way, pm if you want to talk more.Also know a great guide for LOW area that could do all species."
5350657,BornToFish,2017-02-22 21:27:00,1224,"Greetings,A number of thoughts came to mind when I read the original post. First, I'm not sure what is meant by ""bigger"" northerns. Does ""bigger"" mean 45-50+ inches or 35-40 inches? If it's the latter, I suspect there are hundreds of lakes that would be in play for your group. You are likely looking for a very select group of lakes if you mean the former range in length, If your fisherman would be satisfied by northern pike in the mid to upper thirty inch range, you might need to ""fish out of the box"". Based on my experience on lakes in NW Ontario during August and early September, I look for bigger northern pike on mid-lake structure rather than shorelines/weeds. I go out to mid-lake rock humps and cast big profile lures that will get down at least ten feet or so in the water column. I start upwind of the hump by 2-3 casts and then drift over and past the hump by 2-3 casts. The northern pike on these rock humps are near the thermocline (at 20+ feet down in the water column). It seems they can't help themselves when they see my lure silhouetted against the surface.Little northern pike know better than to be out on these rock humps.I have found that many of these large northern pike move to very shallow water (inside weed edges) about ten days before turnover. Turnover seems to be at a different time (mid-September to mid-October) every year, so timing this bite can be challenging. I throw big lures and move them very slowly at this time of the season. This is when I get out my bigger stick baits (jerk baits such as Suicks and Bobbies or minnow baits such as Double Ds or Shallow Invaders). Big lures moving slowly have been a key to my success for this shallow water bite, especially in the afternoon when water temperature reaches its daily peak.Good fishing and tight lines!!"
5353337,fldoc1,2017-02-24 08:56:00,69,Thanks Born to Fish for your post. It summarized what I had been reading while researching catching big northerns. I used it as part of an e-mail (you were given credit) to those that are thinking of casting for big northerns. I think of big as over 35 inches but really looking for the 40+. Thanks to pike50plus for Mike Borger's site. He has some great pics and fish stories. I have been to Lake St Joe and we may go again soon plus he had a story about Whitewater Lake that I did a fly in 35 years ago that I enjoyed. I would love to talk with you plus LOW is still on our radar this year so would be interested in the guide. A special thanks to Golden Eagle. We were able to talk on the phone and we had a great conversation. He loves Ontario and is passionate about his lakes and fishing experiences. Little Vermillion is his lake and it is on my bucket list. Mike Borger in a past post identified the 5 best pike lakes in western Ontario. Shoal Lake was included in that list. I will be interested as to how multispecies guys trip goes there in early Sept. I wondering about walleyes in Shoal Lake. (dinner) If one stays at a camp outside of the Shoal Lake how easy is it to access the lake to fish for the day. Thanks to the other posters as each post adds to the knowledge. We fished LacSeul (chamberlin narrows) one June and caught tons of walleyes but few northerns casting the shallows. One big northern was caught off the main dock while fishing for walleyes. Maybe we have to learn some tricks to cast for northerns near the walleyes. Randy from duluth. mn
