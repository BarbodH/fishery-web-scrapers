Lew came up and was staying in his van in the parking lot of Walmart, he declined all attempts to crash at my place...oh well. No way I could let him come all the way up and not have a crack at Lac Seul as well as some shore fishing and our local lake (video on the way for that). We had a great week and lew was a gentleman, even spent a whole day helping to lay laminate flooring at my place. Here is the video from a quick shore fish and our visit to lac Seul.
