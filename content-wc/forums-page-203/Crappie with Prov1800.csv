He took me to one of his crappie hotspots and it did not disappoint....great morning out, we plan to fish a lot together in the future, here is a video of some of the action. THANKS JOHN!VIDEOhttps://youtu.be/rvIHUgZWW60"

5345809,stjoeguy,2017-02-20 21:25:00,979,Looks like fun! Warm temperatures and rain today mean our lakes are now covered with water. A guy could drown without falling through the ice! I got some crappies last week but it might be a while before I get back onto the ice/water. Thanks for the reminder of what winter is supposed to look like.

The lake was covered with water, good lubrication for the sliders, but snowmobiles were not the right tool for the job, we are taking the side by side trout fishing today instead. Looking forward to the colder temperatures that are coming our way, then a good snow!"
