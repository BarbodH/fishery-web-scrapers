550901,wooglin,2005-08-01 07:31:00,371,"I have a bunch, my friend makes about 6 different recipes for our group, while in Canada on our trip. Recently I have tried, and loved, this: Take a few walleye, fillet them, cut them into about 1 inch pieces. Marinade in Italian dressing for 2-4 hours. Take the pieces, wrap them in a half slice of bacon, stick with toothpick to hold closed. Grill. When the bacon appears to be done, so is the fish. Cover in your favorite bbq sauce. Let that carmelize for a few minutes. Remove. Eat. Great finger food. I also love Orange Peanut walleye, walleye pizza, walleye tacos, and always the Beer Batter walleye (McCormick brand)."
550927,Guest,2005-08-01 15:02:00,0,"My favorite is cajun walleye. I make my own cajun rub right from Emeril's recipe(the stuff he ""bams"" everything with on his show). Once you make his ""Essence"" recipe--which takes less than 5 minutes, you'll never go back to that store bought swill like McCormick's. After rubbing the fillets, heat a cast iron skillet VERY HOT! Pour a little oil(couple teaspoons)in skillet and quickly swirl/ spread it w/ a paper towel. 2 min on each side and they're done. The key is a hot skillet and very little oil."

550934,Guest,2005-08-01 17:22:00,0,What's the easiset way to make Walleye Taco?
550941,jerry bark,2005-08-01 19:57:00,822,"do it just like i described above for pike: bring a packet of your favorite taco mix, i like kroger brand. use just enough taco mix to make some sauce, not the whole packet. throw your filets in and when they are almost done break them up and add the taco mix and some water. simmer to make the sauce and coat the walleye pieces. add to tortilla with your favortie toppings, i like lettuce and cheese, fresh tomato too."
550947,Guest,2005-08-01 22:13:00,0,"Dud: Try this link:http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/reci...6_8489,00.html If it fails just google ""Emeril's essence"" and you'll find it.It has about 10-12 different ingredients, but the key I think is the epaprika."
551012,rpieske,2005-08-03 11:59:00,1276,"Here is a simple walleye recipe that only takes 15 minutes. Place your walleye filets in a baking dish, season to taste, cover with mixed Stove Top Stuffing and bake 15 minutes at 400 degrees. Delicious!"

551189,Guest,2005-08-06 22:56:00,0,around here we like to take a dozen or so 3-4 lb walleyes and after fileting we grind them for fish patties. we make enough to feed all three of us and the dogs like them too.
549881,Guest,2005-06-29 07:48:00,0,Come on guys. Share those culinary delights. i know that some of you have unusael ways to prepare Walleye and it would be great to hear some new recipes. Here is one my wife likes to prepare......Chop fillets into chunks and brown them in small amount of oil with finely chopped onion and salt and pepper to taste. When they start to turn white smother them in your favorite salsa and stir the salsa in. When fillets are flakey white smother them with grated cheddar cheese and eat them up.
549886,Frankm,2005-06-29 09:29:00,154,"Walleye Sandwhiches. Bread Walleye fillets with Shore Lunch breading or whatever you like. Pan fry. Serve on french roll with lettuce, tomato, and mayo. This year we tried Walleye alfredo. Pan fry a couple Walleye Fillets chunk them up mix in with alfredo sauce and fettuchini noodles. Good stuff!"
549920,Reelmn,2005-06-29 19:47:00,328,"I use Zaterain's Seasoned Fish-Fri available at Sam's club in a HUGE container(app. 6#'s). It's a dry mix that I transfer to a zip-lok bag for the trip. I store the rest in the freezer for later use. Coat the fillets with the mix, drop in app. 2 inches of 350 degree peanut oil and let them fry for about 3 minutes per side. Don't add any other seasoning or salt, this has plenty, but not enough to overpower the delicate flavor of walleye. When you have a platter of fish and a skillet full of fried potatoes and onions, give me a call at 1-800-can't-get-enuff and I'll be there ASAP. I'm the camp cook and really enjoy feeding the guys during the week. I always work up a menu for breakfast and dinner for the entire week then post it on the cabin wall. I like to leave the menu on the wall for the next group of guests to droll over. Enjoy"
549926,Guest,2005-06-30 06:34:00,0,"Sweet and Sour Walleye. Cut the fillets into pieces, dip into milk and egg, then flour and fine bread crumbs. Deep fry to golden brown and then pour on the sweet and sour sauce. You can either buy it ready made or like I do, get the my wife to make it, it's the best. Just had it last night, delicous. W5"
549965,Guest,2005-06-30 22:20:00,0,"combine one ten pound walleye add a'crawler,leech or minnow.Repeat as needed."
550872,Guest,2005-07-30 15:44:00,0,We've tried this and loved it. Cajun Walleye. Take the fillets and bomb them with Chicken Cajun mix without salt. ( Maybe McCormick. Make sure it is salt free).Heat about 2 inches of oil and throw in cut up peppers and onions first until they brown and then throw in the walleye for about three minutes on each side. When you serve sprinkle the veggies over the walleye. It is a tasty change .
550891,phishfearme,2005-07-31 19:02:00,1242,get a fish holder for the grill and spray it with PAM. lay the fillets on the holder then either use spray butter/margarine or spread soft margarine over the fillets. sprinkle lemon pepper seasoning. repeat for other side then put the holder with fillets on a HOT grill. a few minutes on each side and WOW! - phish
550893,jerry bark,2005-07-31 21:01:00,822,"here's on i discovered recently after catching a few nice ones: i placed some filets(with ribs in) rib side down on a piece of foil and layed that on my campfire grill over a nice bed of coals. then sprinkled lightly with some tony cachere's creole seasoning(wal-mart). when the filets looked half cooked i then slid the foil over and sprayed some pam on the grill and turned the filets onto the grill to finish. this was simple and very good! the campfire cooking on one side made a real difference. also, perchjerker's walleye cake recipe is good too, well worth the effort if you are at the cabin. cheers jerry"
550895,jerry bark,2005-07-31 21:06:00,822,"i also made some taco ""meat"" using pike that we caught in canada. its really good if you just use a little bit of the taco mix packet, just enough to give it some color and make a little sauce. i used about one table spoon for 1/2 pound of pike filet, give or take. you could easily do this for shore lunch if you pre-bagged some cheese and lettuce and a tupperware for a bit of salsa. if you just have to deep fry something then make some fresh tortilla chips from some corn tortillas!!! cheers jerry"
550896,Clark,2005-07-31 22:24:00,5,"Hi all. My brother-inlaw showed me a nice treat last year. Walleye Wraps. Slice your fillet thin and take a half length of bacon, about three inches. Lay the fillet about 3 inches and the same width as the bacon on top of the bacon, roll them and stick a toothpick through them to hold the roll, then put your favourite BBQ sauce on them and cook on a griddle with pam or your favourite light oil. When he told me the deal I thought it wasn't sounding that good. Try it! Cheers Clark"
