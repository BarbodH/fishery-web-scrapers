550471,Guest,2005-07-19 00:24:00,0,"Hi. I asked at the border what they do with the potatoes they take from americans. Do they send them back to the states? you would think if you cant have them no one can have them right? No what the do is and this is what the border guy said , is that they donate them to a shelter and they use them even though the are in canada! How about that."

Is it ok to bring Canadian produce back into the U.S.? We have always left them at camp and not tried to bring them back. Just wondering."

550495,Guest,2005-07-19 12:45:00,0,I too have seen potatoes in the dumpster at I-Falls crossing.
550526,Guest,2005-07-20 00:41:00,0,Hi. the question is was this dumpster on the american side or the canadian side of the border? if canadaian then hey whats going on they are still staying in canada right? any way its all a tit for tat thing.
550530,wooglin,2005-07-20 07:25:00,371,"Dumpster was in Canada, eh."
550555,Guest,2005-07-21 00:14:00,0,EH!
551247,Guest,2005-08-08 20:56:00,0,We can't bring produce with us from Canada to the U.S. even if they are Washington grown apples just off the truck.....from Washington. Apparently they don't want them back?
