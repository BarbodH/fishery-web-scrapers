I dont know exactly how many fish we caught but it was more than I wanted to count. I would guess that at least 1/3 of our fish were over the slot and we had 7 fish that measured over 27"". Most of our fish came on Leech/Jig and of course we used minnow/jig also. We did drag some Shad Raps on flats in 10 /20 of water and caught several of our big fish doing that. Thanks to...... Gold Pines Camp"

551140,Guest,2005-08-04 21:07:00,0,Good bite in 12 to 25' of water. When we were able to find a good ledge and stay on it we did well. The best spots were when the wind would drift us from deeper water into the shallow area. Coming up those drops was a killer for us.
