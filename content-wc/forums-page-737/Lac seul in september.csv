551037,Guest,2005-08-04 04:51:00,0,I thought they asked about lacseul. If so then fishing is very close to the dam. Under the old railrod bridge. If staying at a resort the owner will put you on the spots. Very close fishing at that time of year as they travel back to there spawing areas.

551049,Guest,2005-08-04 09:04:00,0,Take your first left after you cross the dam going north. That will take you to Little Canada Camp and you may be able to put a boat in there or rent a boat from the camp. The city dock for Ear Falls is marked with a sign if you proceed North on the highway through Ear Falls. The turn is to the west and you go a mile or so before you reach the dock.
