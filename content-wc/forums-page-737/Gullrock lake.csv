He can esily be spotted since he is only 4' 10"" tall and always has a Coke in one hand and a Marlboro in the other. Dont be fooled by his gentle appearence....when he gets his rod in his hand he is relentless....his fishing pole too!!!!"
551144,grt1,2005-08-04 22:14:00,259,What I call the sunken island is the flats just out from the claybanks where the poplar point sign is posted on the top of the bank
551216,Guest,2005-08-07 22:46:00,0,"Jughead, Hope your week goes as well as ours last week. Plenty of walleyes to be had in water between 21' - 27'. Weather went from great to HOT midweek, than thunder boomers, lots of wind and finally settled back down on Friday to end with a great evening of pulling 20""+ 'eyes one after another. Brother Jeff got a bonus 39"" northern jigging with light tackle and Bud, Melinda and family did a great job of ensuring everyone at Five Lakes had a chance at a great trip...have to say one thing...if you are going to spend the time and money to go up that far north for a fishing vacation...buy, beg or borrow a decent depth finder/locator. Too many times I see people in camp struggle because they don't use the technology available to improve your chance of success. Going to have to remember this one well as I'm taking a year off...722 days till I see Gullrock again! Craig"
550976,Guest,2005-08-02 21:15:00,0,Anything new from Gullrock? Leave Friday the 5th. Just wondering if there are any new reports. Thanks
550988,grt1,2005-08-03 06:47:00,259,"I was at the sunken Island 2 days ago for 2 hours, caught 20 walleye and had 5 over 20"" they seem to be in 27-32 feet, water temp at the surface 73 degrees, Things might change as we had thunderstorms last night and are having one as i type this"
550995,Guest,2005-08-03 08:04:00,0,"Hows the air temperature been up there lately? hot, humid, cool,? and do you know what its supposed to be like next week? (as unpredictable as it is, i was just wondering if you had heard any long term forecasts) how has the fishing been?"
551003,Renn,2005-08-03 09:19:00,87,"Jonnya83, Here are two links I have found that have long term forecasts for Red Lake:http://www.weather.ca/weather/cities...s/CAON0578.htmhttp://www.wunderground.com/cgi-bin/...ake%2C+Ontario They are both typical weather forcasters though....they have conflicting long term forecasts!! :-) Pack your long johns and shorts and pray you don't have to wear both at the same time!!! :rotflmao: See you Saturday. I can't wait. I need to sleep the whole night through!!! 74 hours and counting!!! Renn"
551005,Guest,2005-08-03 09:28:00,0,"renn, here is yet another link i found with yet another long term forecast...i think i like this one the best! i sure hope its not hot every day! i'd http://wwwa.accuweather.com/canada-f...metric=1rather see 65 and cloudy than 85 and sunny. and the sleepless nights continue! i think i've slept maybe 5 hours a night this entire week...friday at noon can't come soon enough! see you saturday!"
551042,Guest,2005-08-04 07:22:00,0,"Thanks GRT for the report. What are you calling the sunken island? We fish a spot just south of the Gull Rock itself, that we call 7:30. It goes from 30 FOW up to 7FOW and back down. I think I have heard people call that the sunken island. Is that what you are referring to? Thanks again. We get in our cabin in just under 55 hours now. Jughead"

551046,Renn,2005-08-04 08:25:00,87,"Jughead, Hopefully, grt will post back before you leave. I can think of 5 different ""sunken islands"" we have caught fish on in the past. It is hard to give exact locations to most because, ""you have to line up the radar tower on one shore with the tall pine tree on the other shore"", etc. My best advice to you is either make mental note of where boats are located on the lake and fish them when you want to try someplace new. Or keep your eye on your electronics while you are traveling to a spot. This is the way we found most of our best ""sunken islands"". This is also fun because you can sometimes find ""new"" hotspots by accident. That's the great thing about Gullrock, just about any structure you find will hold fish. 51 hours and counting!! Renn"
