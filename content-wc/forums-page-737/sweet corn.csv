551031,Guest,2005-08-03 20:27:00,0,Any truth to the rumor that the border is asking about sweet corn in addition to potatoes? Leaving Monday and was planning on taking some on our fly-in.

551146,multispecies,2005-08-05 02:16:00,29,"As a general rule I leave all produce out when packing up for a trip. I spent three hours in Detroit at the U.S. crossing one time, and had to go thru Agricultural Inspection over two bananas in a road lunch..!!!! The nice lady didn't know they were not citrus fruit.The guy at Ag. inspection laughed his butt off and apologized,and allowed us to continue bananas in hand. For the sake of a few bucks it is not worth the hassel. Hey and why the corn?, we import it out of season from the U.S and Mexico??????"
551151,Tax Man Mike,2005-08-05 10:03:00,2,"Think twice about corn on a fly-in. Two years ago, one in our group thought it would be good to bring along. It ended up costing us some big $'s, as it added to our already excess weight limit. Skip tyhe corn and bring more beer."
551152,Frankm,2005-08-05 10:33:00,154,I'm with multispecies. We don't bring any produce. We make a list at home and we just stop at the Safeway in Fort Frances. They have a nice produce section and prices are reasonable. I figure any small thing that will stop any necessary delays at the border the better. Remember your on vacation don't nickel and dime yourself to death.
551180,Guest,2005-08-06 16:33:00,0,at 1.99 CND a Dozen for first of the season Peaches and Cream Ontario corn... you are nuts to bring your own across... it doesnt get any better here and the price is cheap enough! Gerritt.
