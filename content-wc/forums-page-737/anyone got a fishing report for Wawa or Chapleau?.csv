513721,Guest,2001-07-11 17:04:00,0,"Been to Franks camp twice.TOP NOTCH SERVICE, GREAT FOOD,BUT FISHING STINKS.YOU STILL SHOULD HAVE A GOOD TIME.SMALL, SMALL WALLEYES, AND PIKE ONLY BITE ON LIVE BAIT.GOOD LUCK !!!HATE TO TELL YOU THIS BUT I DO NOT WANT TO SEE YOU GET YOUR HOPES UP FOR LUNKER FISH."
513722,Ketchenanny,2001-07-12 02:53:00,38,"Thanks for the info. We take a week in Canada to relax and have fun. Most years, we don't even bring any fish home. I think if there are lot's of little ones, it will be a good fishing challenge to find the big ones. Living on Lake St. Clair in Michigan gives us the opportunity for the big ones. Being that we can drive-in, I will be bringing my own boat. That gives me a opportunity to try several different lakes in the area."
513720,Guest,2001-07-12 07:48:00,0,"We are going to Wawa the week of August 12th. We are staying on Whitefish Lake, but not at Totomenai (my sister and brother-inlaw organized the trip). Any fishing tips would be appreciated. I don't mind soaking a minnow or leech all day for a few bites, but my wife will probably try to drown me by the end of the week."
551225,Guest,2005-08-08 08:44:00,0,HOW DID YOU DO FISHING AT Kanipahow Kamps in Chapleau AND WHAT DID YOU THINK OF THE LODGE?
513710,Guest,2001-07-05 12:09:00,0,I'm heading up to the Wawa/Chapleau area in about a week anyone got a fishing report and what the lucky lures are thanks!
513711,Guest,2001-07-05 17:22:00,0,"Sorry, no report to offer, but I'm going to Chapleau (Prairie Bee Lake) in a few weeks. Where are you headed?"
513712,Guest,2001-07-06 09:58:00,0,I'm headed to Kanipahow Kamps in Chapleau. This will be my first time there??? I'm not familiar with the area. But i'm sure the owner of the camp will show me where to fish and what the fish are biting on.
513713,Guest,2001-07-06 10:41:00,0,Hey EyeBanger... How long have you been going to Prairre Bee and how did you hook up with that place?
513715,Guest,2001-07-06 11:42:00,0,Going to Chapleau next Saturday with friends. This time of year it's leeches on phelps floaters. the area produces early in the morning and in evening. Looking forward to it.
513714,Guest,2001-07-06 12:46:00,0,"LK - We've been going there about 8 years. We like the combination of decent rates, low fishing pressure, and good popluation of walleye - not a lot of huge ones, but great eating.It used to be owned by some people who live in my general area, and I saw them displaying at a local outdoor show. this was about the time that we were getting fed up with another lake nearer to Wawa, so we gave Prairie Bee a try and liked it."
513723,tony,2001-07-09 18:59:00,49,"I,m going to Wawa the 16th thru the 21st.I am going to fish the Magpie River and Hammer Lake.Anyone know anything about hammer lake?"
513724,Guest,2001-07-09 20:39:00,0,"Used to go to Magpie it was great for pike, walleye were few and far between. Never been to Hammer though. Let me know how you do when you get back interested in how the Magpie is for a short fall pike trip."
513716,Ketchenanny,2001-07-10 00:47:00,38,"I have alway's took a seaplane out of Wawa but have never fished the Wawa area. Due to many reasons we decided not to fly-in any more. Next year we have booked a week at Totomenai Lodge (drive-in & taking my own boat) on Whitefish Lake about 17 miles from Wawa. This Lodge was recommended by a guide who guides at Kaby Lodge (fly-in only) and a couple of locals from Wawa. When I called to inquire about the services offered, Frank the owner, answered all of our questions and even gave us a break on the cost of a guide for the entire week that we will be there. I offer this information soly based on recommendations by locals from Wawa. I also would like tips and hot-spots for fishing the lake and info on the Lodge."
513717,Guest,2001-07-10 07:20:00,0,"Hey KetchennyTotomenai has internet site www.intonex.com/totomenaiAs for hot spots he seems to send all his guests to all the right spots. I have a cottage on Whitefish lake and the lake is so huge you need guidance to eliminate unproductive water.But you won't get it from me :) , I want fish to be in that lake for another 40 years."
