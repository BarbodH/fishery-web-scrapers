We were fishing the ""normal"" spots which were very slow so I looked at the map and found a small island that we had never fished before close by. The depth contours looked favorable so I talked my partner into trying it. One end of it was a steep rocky drop off and the other was a gradual slope with a huge weed bed most of which was 5-10 ft deep. I was burning and jerking larger cranks over the weeds for northerns and having a blast. My boat partner was slowly reeling in a rattl-trap. He was catching walleyes in the same weeds. So I started reeling mine in slower and slower. Once I got the technique down (no jerks, just slow retrieve and a pause whenever I hit something) I started catching walleyes too. On 3 consecutive casts I had 21, 20, 23 inch walleyes, 2 of which hit at the boat like norhterns! What a fun time that was. We were able to duplicate the success on other weedy areas as well. Just another play in the old playbook now."

551060,Guest,2005-08-04 13:09:00,0,"A presentation we use on the weed Walleye is putting on a lindy no snagg sinker and 4 or 5 feet behind it tie on a floating jig with your favorite live bait. This gives you a chance to stay in the strike zone a long time and has produced a lot of fish for us. One of my buddies caught his biggest Walleye ever doing this last month on Lac Seul....31"" Walleye"

550991,DaveIN,2005-08-03 07:37:00,191,"I just returned on Sunday from a one week fishing trip north of Kenora. This trip produced the largest number of good sized walleye that I have caught in the six years of visiting this river. The river level was up 6 feet from what I was used to. What my point is, just after launching the boat upon arrival, I discovered that the circuit board in the trolling motor was bad. With no trolling motor, I had to rethink how to fish and make a decent presentation short of anchoring in one place. The best method appreared to be to make use of the wind and current. This lead to fishing areas that I have not fished before and different methods. I had fallen in a rut and was forced out of it and that really produced excellent results. I hope that some of you take note of this and next time out, try something new."
551007,Guest,2005-08-03 09:41:00,0,"Amen! I've been going up to Canada with my Father-in-law for 10+ years and he and the other older guys always do the same thing (jig, jig, jig) and go to the same spots. This year I finally was in a boat with just me and my brother-in-law and had more control of where we fished. We outfished them by far and had much more fun in the new spots!"
551010,IaDave,2005-08-03 11:15:00,476,I second that on the same old thing. My fishing buddy does the same thing and will try something different for about a hour and then wants to go back to the old way. I never complain because I'm a liitle that way myself. I'm considering going to Lac Seul next month by myself and hire a guide for a quick 3 day trip. Anybody ever done that? I think you could learn alot more techniques.

551020,MoWalleyeguy,2005-08-03 15:47:00,409,"Not sure if you will learn a lot more but you could learn something different. I have found that guides often will fish what is easiest for the ""client"" some have difficulty jigging, feeling the bottom, etc and so will use bottom bouncing. Some guides hate to bottom bounce so will jig. etc etc. But if your lucky and find a guide who just knows how to catch fish the best way for that day and situation then you will be in luck. It doesnt matter how much experience a person has... when out on a new body of water you can sure save a lot of exploring by hanging out with someone who has spent days/months and years and knows it well. I always try to learn by either going out a day or two or at least get them to mark maps for me if its some place I have never been too."

551023,Mike Kansas,2005-08-03 17:48:00,1463,"Hey Dave, Hope all is going well for you and you are having a great fishing season.Several years back (15)my wife and I went on a trip and she got sick and didnt want to fish. I decided that her flu provided an opportunity for me to expand my fishing skills and technique. I hired a Guide and made it clear to him that I wanted to learn some new things and catch and release some big fish. He responded very well and the three days I spent with him not only produced some great fishing but also enhanced my fishing ability. He was very helpful. He explained to me why he fished where we did and why we fished how we did. I feel without a doubt that those three days on the water have put more fish and more big fish in my boat every day since I fished with him. Time alone with a Master is key to success. If this is your goal make sure and express it to the Guide you pick and make it clear to him that his time with you is going to be worth more to him than his normal rate....let him know that you will tip him well. The guide I had at that time was charging $100 a day ....the first night I paid him $150 and each day afterwards the same. Thats not a lot of money today but a 50% tip to a Guide who likes to fish and has plenty of knowledge will put you on his honeyholes the next couple days...be a gentleman and dont GPS his spots and dont mark them on a map. Knowledge is power and all you want to do is learn to ba a better fisherman. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"

Plenty of new spots at Lac Seul, some I drove right past for years are now regulars. Suspended fish are a whole new frontier. Have also had a BLAST fishing blade baits and jigging spoons on reefs and drop-offs. One of the things that has worked very well for us is to really cover spots close to camp. Most people have a tendency to go away, we've made some great catches within sight of Lost Island Lodge. Weed walleyes are another. Try it all, it's vacation!!"
