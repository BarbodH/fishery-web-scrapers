I really enjoy the different stories they have about the different types of people they meet. Some stories are funny, some sad, while others can be very annoying because of how rude some people are. So all of you Guides out there please entertain us with some of your best stories while you were out doing your job and helping us chase some fish. I'm sure there are lots of us that would really love to hear them. Thanks Wingmann"

In my buddies boat were 3 guys and one of them had a terrible stutter problem. While, as luck would have it this fellow with the stutter caught the biggest northern he ever caught. Was he excited and the more excited he got, the worse the stutter. His fishing partners asked him to hold up the fish so they could take his picture. Without taking the fish off the line or lure, he held it up and the northern started flipping and trying to get off. Sure enough the line broke and over the side went the northern, the lure still in his lip. This guy stutters a curse, realizes the northern has his lure, and over the side he goes to get his lure back. The guy taking the picture captures it all and when the stutterer surfaces, he's got the northern in his hand and a big smile on his face. He got his fish and his lure back and was the toast of his party for the duration of the trip."

My wife had a nice Walleye on (4 lbs) and she was having a real battle with it. When she got it up to the side of the boat and was admireing her catch a Pike that was a good 40""++++ toothy critter grabbed her Walleye. She opened the bail and let him go and he played with the Walleye for a good 5 minutes before he dropped it and let it go. He had made a pretty good comotion in the water and after he left we were all talking about it when a huge Musky came up and made a couple passes at the Walleye and finally ripped it off the jig. We figured the Pike playing with it drew the Muskie in and the Muskie must have ran off the Pike. It was an awesome experience and the Guide said he had seen it happen with one species or the other but never two different species of predators after one Walleye."
