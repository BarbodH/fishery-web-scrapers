550880,phishfearme,2005-07-31 07:54:00,1242,"i've been looking at the web sites of the numerous gouin outfitters but have yet been able to find an isolated cabin, all to itself, well away from other cabins or the main lodge. can any of you gouin experts help out? also, rather than ""doing the dirt road drive"" we're considering flying from the maniwaki, baskatong, mont-laurier area. any recommendations here? thanks, phish"

550986,beagle22b07,2005-08-03 06:05:00,34,phish We've used Air Mont-Laurier in the past to fly us into Caesars Lodge then Caesar took us to the out-post camps. They are in Ste. Veronique and also have fishing out-posts of their own. Here is the web site http://airmontlaurier.com/english.html. We used them to avoid the Clova Road to Caesars pick-up point. Don't go to the Gouin anymore but would like to try it again. Going to O'Sullivan Lake in Quebec next week and will be taking my own boat. Hope this helps. Larry

551029,phishfearme,2005-08-03 19:54:00,1242,"larry - thanks for the info. i sent an email request for details to ceasar's about a week ago but no reply yet - i'll try calling. looking at their website, i note that gouin cabins 1, 2 and 4 look pretty isolated. have you been to any of these? are other outfitters or private cabins near by? i note in other threads that the road from st laurier to parent is in excellent shape and takes about 3 1/2 hours now. flying from st laurier sounds much better but it'll add $250-$300 each to the cost of the trip - may be worth it. thanks again, phish"

551038,beagle22b07,2005-08-04 06:15:00,34,"phish In 1998 we went to ""Super"" and in 1999 we went to ""Gouin #3"". Super was pretty isolated, but at the far North end of our limits with the boats, we could hear the logging operations although we never saw them. There were 2 moose camps and 1 indian camp in the area we roamed, but saw no one except an Indian in a cargo canoe duck hunting. Super was the best trip to Canada I ever had. The first day on the water, my son caught a 44"" Northern. It was a huge fish, not just long and skinny, but big and fat, a real trophy. We released him. About 4 days into the trip we finally figured out the walleye and were boating 80 per day per boat. All in all the trip was excellent. The following year we went to Gouin #3 because the facilities were better. Indoor plumbing and shower. Super had no water and an outhouse. One member of our group was there before and thought Gouin #3 was the best spot so that is where we went. Much to our dismay, we were seeing as many as 14 different boats a day and people were even pulling up next to us and fishing. As the week went on, we discovered that these people were coming in on an old logging road and launching from a remote cove. Here we were paying extra money to be in a remote fly-in only area and there were people driving in. On top of that, there were several active camps in the area and even one right across the bay from us where someone flew in while we were there. There was way too much traffic there for us. We ran into some people from Gouin #4 and they pretty much echoed the same. My only complaint with Caesars is that they always found a way to get an extra $50 out of you for being over weight, other than that it was OK. Like I said before, ""Super"" was the best Canada trip I've ever been on. We chose to fly-in to Caesars since the drive was about 5 extra hours at that time, don't know what it would be now, but from what I understand, you can drive right to Caesars main lodge now. Don't know where you are driving from, but I talked to an outfitter at a sports show last year that I really comfortable with, he was from Berthelot Lake Lodge near Sennetere. You might want to look at them if you are interested in a fly-in to the far west area of the Gouin Resevour. This will be my first trip to O'sullivan and from what I've read here, it should be good. Last year I went to Club Trout Lake, where the fishing was just average, but the accomodations were the best I've ever been to. I'd go back there too, it's a drive-in just out of Belleterre. I have found for the most part, that if you are in a remote area, it dosen't matter if you drove there or flown there, the fishing is about the same, and I really like using my own boat. Another thing to consider if going to the Gouin, is that slot limits are going in effect there next year I believe, so look into that. Anyway, good luck and tight lines. I'll be on the road to Quebec in 24 hrs. Let you know what it was like when I get back. Larry"

""isolated"" to an outfitter has a different definition that to a customer. thank you for the valuable info, larry. ceasar's have a number of other lakes that appear interesting and isolated but i'd sure like to hear from people who've been to them. driving for a full day or two and then flying to an ""isolated"" cabin spending a ton of money just to run into the ""rude or am i expecting too much"" syndrome (see this thread on this board) doesn't interest me. are there any really isolated cabins on the gouin? thanks, phish"

551050,beagle22b07,2005-08-04 09:27:00,34,"phish You're right. I really don't think there are any really isolated areas on the Gouin. There are drive-in places at the South end and there is a road into the Obijiwan reservation on the North end, so if you have a good sized boat & motor, you can cover a lot of water in a day. Still, there is a huge amount of water up there and you never have to worry about running out of areas to fish. When we were at ""Super"" it took us 4 days to find a hump out in the open lake where the walleye were holding in about 20'. Once that happened, we could go there and catch walleye until you were tired of reeling them in. I'm sure there are areas like that everywhere, but it takes time to figure it out. Sometimes 1 week is not enough, that is why I'm trying to find a decent place to go so I can return the following year and continue to put the puzzle together. Maybe O'Sullivan will be that place.
