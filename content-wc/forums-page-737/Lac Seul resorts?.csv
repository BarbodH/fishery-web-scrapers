We have been fishing on Eagle Lake for a few years (also Gullrock) and possibly want to try Lac Seul, after reading the posts here on how good the walleye fishing on Lac Seul is. Also, have read that it is a good idea to use a guide for first day to be shown where hot spots and prop hazards are? it's hard to make a change to a new lake when you are so familiar with a lake and know it well."
