Any further thoughts on how good LU is? Was told Spring Bay was the best shot at multiple pike over 20#s each day and Johnson Island was out of this world in Sept for tons of 20 pound lakers, with enough 30#s and some even bigger. I take all fishing talk with several grains of salt -just curious how 'salty' this account might be? Thanks"
551259,dhottle,2005-08-09 12:32:00,163,"blu1fin, those reports are right on, not salty at all. Lakers Unlimited has two camps, one is primarily for pike with good laker fishing available. The other camp is primarily lake trout fishing with good pike fishing available. Our group of four which includes Atlanta dave have been going there since 1999. If you have more specific questions email me or call."

551015,Atlanta Dave,2005-08-03 12:33:00,323,"We fish lake athtbasca just south of there for the last 6 years. Going home a few years ago we met a group who were returning from tanzin, at the edmonton airport. we had our pics from our week developed already and they we in awe of the size we had compared with what they got.If I remember about 15 lb trout was their biggest and we had many in the 30 range. May have been a slow week but their size was not too impressive. Atlanta Dave"
