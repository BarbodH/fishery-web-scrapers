551183,Guest,2005-08-06 20:09:00,0,can some one who is not legal to smoke in the states bring over cigarettes if they are legal in the states? Will the border let them bring the cigarettes across?
551186,Guest,2005-08-06 21:06:00,0,"Is it just me, or does that question not make sense?"
551187,Matches,2005-08-06 21:53:00,236,What are you smoking Cody? Sounds like you better stay away from the border.
551204,Guest,2005-08-07 11:56:00,0,Do you mean can a 17year old kid bring across a carton of smokes eventhough it is against they law for the kid to buy them in the states? Sound like someone doesn't want to pay duty on some smokes
