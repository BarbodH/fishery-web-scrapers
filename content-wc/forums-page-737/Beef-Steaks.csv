551163,Guest,2005-08-05 13:21:00,0,Just checking to see if anyone knows if they are letting steaks/beef across at the border. I heard they opened the border back up to beef producers.?. We are leaving next Friday and was planning on bringing some up. Any info is appreciated

THey are suppose to lift the beef ban into the US if they have not done already.http://washingtontimes.com/business/...2201-8894r.htm <*{{}}><"

551166,Guest,2005-08-05 17:55:00,0,"like an earlier post said going up is ok but make sure you eat it all up there, the only way you can bring it back is if the beef is labeled from a store or locker plant in the united states"

I cannot recall even being asked about what kind of food we were brining into the country. Occasionally we'd been asked about worm bedding but have never been checked. In fact, the one time we were required to unload two vehicles and run everything through the x-ray, even though we had just a few too many bottles of liquor, beer and too many cigars, no mention was ever made of either (nor the two bags of taters). However, if we'd had any weapons I suspect we'd most likely still be in Canada. I should mention that we cross from NY State (various points). It seems that in recent years the focus at the border crosing has been weapons and, I guess, that's a good thing. Thunderstick"
