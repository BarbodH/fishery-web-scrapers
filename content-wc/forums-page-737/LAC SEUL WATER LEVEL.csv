551244,Guest,2005-08-08 15:32:00,0,"Normal? Water levels fluctuate on LS so much from one time of year to another, and from one season to the next, ""normal"" is starting to become very hard to define. That said, the water level is high, although it is usually getting high at this time of year. This year however, the lake was reaching ""high"" levels earlier in the season than could be considered ""normal"" (like back in mid-June). Water levels have not changed that much since then."
