I can't remember if it was Scout Lake Camp or which one. We went there several years back and it was run by good looking lady. We had a great trip. It was much like a fly in. After about 4 in the afternoon, all the other boats were gone and it was like you were the only people on the lake. It is worth looking into."
6597292,Carnhzkr,2021-09-15 13:51:00,964,Scout lake lodge has the Mckenzie Bay outpost. Lac Seul Lodge has outposts at Sunlight Lake and Black Bay. I know for certain that LSL has minimum occupancy requirements for their two outposts.
6597452,stumcfar,2021-09-16 08:48:00,451,I don't see an outpost listed anymore on Scout Lake's website. It was a nice cabin and a very enjoyable trip the year we went to the outpost.
6597454,Slim Shady,2021-09-16 09:00:00,4,That's what I found out. Evergreen used to have an outpost too (I think)
6593858,Slim Shady,2021-08-31 10:36:00,4,"I finally get to take my 2 sons to Canada June 2022 - baseball is DONE I've been to the ear falls area and Sioux Lookout - I'm thinking of trying a boat in outpost on Lac Seul I only get to do this once, want to make it right Any recommendations. I'd like to fish for 3 days Thanks"
6593860,Da' Walleye Assassun,2021-08-31 10:49:00,358,Three days is incredibly short. Try to swing five or six days if possible.
6593862,Slim Shady,2021-08-31 10:55:00,4,"Of course it is, but it is what it is"
6593864,Yellowfin123,2021-08-31 11:16:00,2182,"i know thats a bucket list destination for me to get up in the ne waters.. i assume you mean 3 nights and sqeeze in about 4 days fishin shoot i'd do it, kids would have a ball there fishin and swimming. battin down the hatches and strap the kids down and go for it"
6593914,PRO-V16,2021-08-31 15:43:00,454,Call Anderson's lodges in Sioux Lookout. I believe they have several from Bear Narrows north. Might check Moosehorn and Winoga Outposts too.
6593932,oldlund,2021-08-31 18:13:00,209,Lac Seul outposts on chamberlain narrows is great. It is a 37 mile boat in and you can bring your own boat. I haven't been there for a few years. Because of the boat in it's unlikely you will fish much before noon on your first day. A factor to consider for such a short trip.They don't have guides though you likely will not need one. Like any water there can be bad days but good days are much more common. I've been there probably 10 to 15 times. If you're a party of three you may have a hard time booking that time of year as the cabins are fairly large and they understandably want to fill them.Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk Pro
6593964,David Anderson,2021-08-31 22:42:00,2073,Heading up there Saturday assuming my Covid test comes back negative. Have been going there since 2013 and my group that I go with has been going there since 1994. Fabulous place. Great fishing is close to the resort and the ride in is fabulous! June is a great time but try to book early as this is their busy time.
6593984,jimirjr,2021-09-01 05:43:00,1149,We will be there beginning 9/11 !
6594008,Mazaska,2021-09-01 07:50:00,18,Also heading there on 9/11 to Gold Pines Camp near Ear Falls. Pete and Christa (owners) have been great over the years and look forward in seeing them again!
