I've been up there twice in early July, but never fished the lake in the fall. Anyone have any tips? Will fish be in drastically different locations? I'm assuming it's a minnow bite, but is it worth getting crawlers for this time of year, or bringing plastics? Any tips or advice are appreciated, I know Ian will help us out when we are up there, he's a great on-shore guide, but just want to make sure I pack the appropriate gear!"
6597570,valley366,2021-09-16 16:10:00,193,"I posted a report on our trip from August. https://www.walleyecentral.com/forum...d.php?t=726550Talking to Ian minnows are generally the ticket year round. There was one group in camp the week we were there that was using crawlers with success. We used minnows and some plastics when we found a hot bite. I always think minnows are better but we did boat fish with plastics.Stop at the general store by Perrault falls. Its called Duchies or something. They have jigs called hammered jigs on the far wall. The pink, gold and orange one was lights out. My kid used that jig all week. Although my other kid insisted his orange and yellow fire tiger was the ticket. I stuck with my hot pink one most of the week.Good luck. Ian will put you on fish."

That's kind of what I figured, I just haven't ever really heard people talk about fishing plastics up there, and I know down here some of my biggest fish have come on plastics. Do you happen to know if Dutchie's sells fishing licenses and outdoors cards? That might be a perfect spot/timing to get those!"
6597674,Tonyo,2021-09-17 06:26:00,212,Im not sure if they sell them or not but it is just as easy to take care of it at home and online. Just head over to to https://www.huntandfishontario.com/ and you can take care of it all in a matter of a few minutes. The one nice thing is I print out a couple copies to have with me. One in the boat one in my truck and a spare in the cabin. May be overkill but why not. TonyO.
6597826,valley366,2021-09-17 19:58:00,193,Definitely buy them online before leaving home. Very easy process and less headache
