We have never been up there this late in the season but I would like to bring my shotgun and shoot some grouse. Have any of you crossed with a firearm? Was there much hassle at the border? Do you have to pull over and go in? Just curious as to what the entire process looks like. I am aware of the paperwork that needs to be filled out ahead of time, just looking for personal experiences. Any help would be appreciated."

6596340,Tonyo,2021-09-11 15:53:00,212,I have been up a couple times late fall grouse hunting and it really is not that big of a deal. You just have to declare it and stop inside and it really does not take that much time. It vacation and if you want to choruses hunt it’s the price we pay to play. I’ll be up in 2 weeks and will be crossing with a shotgun and it will not be a big deal. Have a great time. TonyO
6596342,Wallychowder,2021-09-11 15:54:00,1567,"just a thought, but maybe when you get to your ""cabin"" with your shotgun, just leave it there so you dont have ro deal with the agent's again !"
6596378,Skywagon,2021-09-12 05:56:00,1106,"When a foreigner brings a gun to Canada the paperwork required is for a given period of time (it used to be 90 days), before that time lapses it can be extended. It would be illegal for him to leave a gun in Canada unattended. If BuckeyeATC had a cabin check by a CO (which they do on occasion, especially during a blitz) and find the gun without current paperwork, who knows what the ramifications might be. Bottom line, bad idea."
6597188,txk4,2021-09-15 06:41:00,31,"We have crossed many times with shotguns. It has been very smooth each time and takes a few minutes. We normally cross at Warroad, but have also crossed at Rainy River and IF. You will need to go in and they will check the serial numbers on the form/shotgun. Fill out your form ahead of time, but do not sign the form until you are in front of the officer. If you are going to do this often, it may be worthwhile to take the PALS course and get a PALS license. The process is even easier than. As far as leaving your gun at the cabin, another thing to consider is that the Canadian gun laws are different and if someone would break into your cabin, steal your gun and commit a crime, you would be facing heavier liability than here in the states. Have a great trip and shoot straight. T"
6597190,LOWrider,2021-09-15 06:49:00,40,Son and I are up hunting right now. I have a PAL so as previously said it's quite easy for me. My son has to fill out the firearms permit. The only thing I'd add to what is previously posted is that with Covid the border agent had him stay in his car and they just took his credit card in for the firearms fee. Took less than ten minutes.
