6596442,stjoeguy,2021-09-12 12:36:00,979,"It was another great trip with Slate Falls Outposts, this time to Eagle Island on Lake St. Joseph, September 4-11. We didn't have the greatest start, however. There was a very short line at the Int. Falls border, so far so good, then four of the six got chosen for the random covid test. Just pull into the parking lot, complete the test, and drop it off at the box in town. Sounds easy. We sat in the trucks and stood outside in the drizzle trying to get a decent signal and connection. Two of us managed to complete the tests there, but the other two had a hard time keeping a connection. After an hour there we decided an internet connection would work better, so we went for lunch at La Place Rendez-Vous. We ordered lunch, signed on to their wi-fi, connected with the covid test site and waited (#43 in the queue). The wait wasn't too long, and when connected with the nurse she asked if anyone else was taking the test, so we were able to get both remaining tests done at the same time. Then we drove back to 600 Scott St. in Ft. Frances to drop off the tests into a small box outside of the U-Haul dealer. No slot, or one-way drop like a mail box, just a small box where you open the door and toss in your test along with the two dozen other ones already there. Apparently it worked because on the way back through Int. Falls on our return trip I got the email letting me know that the test results were available online and I was negative. Whoopee! Total time for the parking lot tests, license at Rainy Lake Sports, lunch, the two additional other tests, and dropping off the tests in the box was 2.5 hours. If you're one of the lucky ones to get tested, my advice would be to find a spot with a good wi-fi connection where you can sit down and complete the test. The Slate Falls Outposts camps are very nice and the Eagle Island central cabin is no exception. It's very roomy and comfortable. The three Eagle Island cabins have a caretaker there that bails the boats, gases them every evening, takes out the garbage and takes care of the fish guts. A guy could get spoiled there. Electric start boats were nice, too. Fishing was good all week with some of the best fishing during the windiest, wettest day. We tried spots in all directions but always wound up at least once per day on a sandbar about 2 miles east of the cabin. It was our go-to spot when we needed fish for dinner. We got nothing big this trip, with 23.5' being the largest, but caught a ton of golden walleye with most between 17-20."

We had great numbers, but the fish over 20' were less than previous years for us. The water temp started out at 63 degree's- a little warm for that time of the year. We had 6 fish over 25 inches. The biggest was 29 inches. I noticed the northerns were super active. The water level was crazy low."
