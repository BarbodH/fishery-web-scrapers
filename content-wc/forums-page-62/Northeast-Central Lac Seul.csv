Are you fishing from Sioux lookout area

Got rained out 1/2 day on Tues, WINDED OUT, big time on Friday.. Pretty good overall although We did not get as many BIG PIKE as usual... Biggest ESOX was 38"" Biggest Eye was 28.5"" We did get at least 1 EYE over 25"" every day by each of Us."
6598556,Dakota Floyd,2021-09-21 11:48:00,62,thanks Jim. What were you using for bait while fishing walleyes?
