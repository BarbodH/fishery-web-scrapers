Jackall iProp? Duo Realis Spinbait? Sizes (weights & lengths)? Lure pattern/color? Any other brand/styles of baits using this technique?Stay safe and I hope each of you get on the water soon!"

I went from drop shot rigging to Ned Rigs. This year I'm going to try to master the Neko Rig plus maybe jump into Spybaiting. Cool stuff.

Megabass screw jig has been better that either of the hard baits. I don't know if it is the Okashira screwhead or the swim bait that attracts fish but I have caught a number of walleye on the Megabass w/3"" Zoom paddle tail."

I have no doubt they would be dynamite for Walleyes in the shallow, but I think the Northerns will engulf them and you'll be losing alot of expensive baits. In addition, spybaits aren't known to be the most durable of lures. We use them on Mille Lacs for smallmouth with great success and do catch quite a few incidental walleyes as well; that said, I would not use them on a fly in when any potential cast could be a northern."
