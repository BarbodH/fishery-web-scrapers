6597470,BCNeal,2021-09-16 09:48:00,19,It would be interesting to see how many of the random tests come back as positive?
6597744,David Anderson,2021-09-17 10:34:00,2073,"Simply interesting as most of us received our results via e-mail last Saturday or Sunday, 2 - 3 days after we returned. Let's see now...Where are you going? Sioux Lookout. And how long are you staying? We are returning on Wednesday, 4 nights in camp. Ok, we are giving random Covid test kits that you need to waste your time on completing, and unfortunately it will take 7 - 9 days to process....I understand that you will be back in the US before your test results are validated so it really doesn't matter at this point your quarantine location, we just don't trust US based 72 hour covid testing so we are testing to validate the accuracy of those tests. By the way, your US based testing is quite a feat as everyone has met the 72 hour requirement. Amazing, Purolator Courier and Switchhealth must be laughing as they stuff the money in their pockets as the government of Canada is paying for the overnight shipment to Toronto, and of course the apparent timely testing of these samples that are shipped."
6594304,mctbone,2021-09-02 06:15:00,26,"We'll be traveling up through Ft Frances a week from now and I am looking for information from anyone who was selected for random testing at that location. As I understand it, I must complete the test within 24 hours and then drop it off somewhere. Is there a site in Ft Frances to do that? Or Kenora our final destination for the day? And we will be entering on a Sunday if that matters."
6594338,MikeAnkeny,2021-09-02 09:50:00,67,We were told by our camp to take test at the camp. They have wifi. Did not hear how the test is picked up or delivered.
6594350,Fisherman Ted,2021-09-02 10:25:00,461,"I had a guest that was selected this week. They took at the test on my lodge over wi-fi. I then dropped it off in Kenora at the Puralotor pick-up, which is at K-Sports Marine. -FT"
6594360,pattmit,2021-09-02 11:25:00,36,I'm headed up in 3 weeks and also wondering the same question. However we are not getting to camp the same day we are crossing. We are staying in Vermillion Bay then driving into camp the next morning. Is it just a 24 hour window or is it supposed to be done that day.
6595254,GNO,2021-09-07 09:43:00,153,"North Air Taxi is a drop off location in Fort Frances. Best to do it in town and drop off before leaving, you should still have access to your data from the states to complete the online switch health call for the testing."
6595364,mctbone,2021-09-07 17:21:00,26,Thanks for the responses
6596170,NARDA 1,2021-09-10 15:15:00,636,Myself and the person traveling with me were selected for the random testing when we crossed 9/8/21 @ 2pm. The border agent couldn't really tell us anything about how to take the test so we opted to bring it to the Lodge (Birch Dale Lodge in Vermilion Bay Ontario) and take it there. We got on line at the lodge and took the test without any real problems. The problem comes when trying to get the tests picked up by the courier which is Purolator. Purolator was not able to decide if our location is in their service area and after 2 failed attempts at scheduling a pickup they determined that they would have to schedule a 3rd party pickup for 9/13/21. So it has been a real P.I.T.A.
6596184,Knutson21,2021-09-10 16:22:00,348,That is why we did my sons test right there just past the boarder. Get it done drop it off and continue on with your vacation.
6596220,NARDA 1,2021-09-10 23:39:00,636,"Understood, but the border agent couldn't give us any info as to what was needed to complete the tests. In hind site that is what we would have done."
6596222,David Anderson,2021-09-10 23:53:00,2073,"we had 6 of 10 guys selected for the random Covid test. It was a mess. 3 hours later we all felt like we had met the requirements but were not sure. 1sst, you needed a phone that had internet capabilities so you could set up an account with SwitchHealth. 2nd you were required to have a video call with a nurse to assure you did the test correctly. 3rd, after all of that you needed to have some one verify that you completed the test via the video phone call. We were fortunate to have connected with a nurse who did all 6 of us on the same call. By the time we finished we had lost the drop off place so a call to SwitchHealth to ask for the drop off location, the guy who answered said there was no drop off at Ft. Francis. We finally talked to someone who said 600 Scott St, which was the U Haul rental place. The box was very unassuming and looked like it was 50 years old, all rusted. It took us over 3 hours to get our tests done and on top of that we had one guy who was told after he returned to the US that he was being quarantined but could not give an explanation, apparently his paperwork was hose but no one was willing to fix it. It was a mess for sure. To bad they didn't have a tent to just go to and get it done, it only took 10 minutes to get my covid test in Minnesota. Very frustrating for sure."
