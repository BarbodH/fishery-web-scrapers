6598626,1shooter,2021-09-21 17:22:00,1493,we had 2 people in our group that showed up at the border with expired passports. They ended up showing them their birth certificate and DL with the expired passports and were let through.
6598656,valley366,2021-09-21 19:31:00,193,Probably need to get to reading. A lot of posts on here about the requirements. Some of the things you need to read up on:COVID vaccination proofNegative test within 72 hours of crossing that Canada will take. Most get the Walgreens version. Look at the Canada website for detailsComplete the arrive can app.Since your passport is expired drivers license and birth certificate. I think they also said bring the expired one.And all the other usual stuffGood luck
