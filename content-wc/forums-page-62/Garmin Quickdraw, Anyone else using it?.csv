6599110,Skywagon,2021-09-23 12:41:00,1106,"After working on it (off and on) all summer, I finally finished mapping an entire lake using a Garmin 93 with Quickdraw mapping. I would like to view the map on my home computer and even manipulate the map if that is possible (a memory card is installed), if any of you have any experience in doing this, or have suggestions, I have questions? Thank you for any thoughts. As a side note, a few tidbits of information for those of you that keep track of our slice of the world. I just got back from the cabin (between Sioux Lookout and Pickle Lake) yesterday after spending several days, there was a big rain on Monday, a few inches, the lake came up 1.5 feet and was still rising Wednesday afternoon when I left, the home lake came up some, but not nearly that much. I spend a couple of sessions Tuesday and Wednesday filling in the last of the gaps on the map, not fishing, the lake temperature was around 60 degrees, the fish were scattered, hanging off the breaks, mostly around 20', in other areas where there was a bait ball, there was generally a handful of fish. A great time of the year to be out and about as long as the weather holds."
6599252,REG,2021-09-24 06:25:00,445,"I'm no help regarding the maps on your computer. But just a little more to add to this topic, I usually fish in June and depths aren't as important as we fish shallow. We were able to get up north last week and the mapping feature was incredible for finding and mapping rock humps out in deeper water. I found and mapped 3 big humps that I hadn't known about and the Smallmouth were all over one of them. It was our best Smallmouth (and probably Walleye) fishing ever and once you have a spot mapped, you can just drive straight back to it.."
6549516,Fishquest,2021-04-12 11:52:00,89,It was my last year update to my fly-in trip and it was awesome to have. For those who don't know what it is here is a link to a explanation. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3CKh0CIj00 I chose this system as it was the easiest for the sharing community and I like my garmin equipment. I took it on two trips last year and shared the contours to the quickdraw community so anyone can download them and have a start to their trip if they have quickdraw. I'll also be watching for others to add to the community and take some possible info along with me and add to it as I go. I have noticed a few lakes with info already and can see this as being a good helper to start out any trip. What are your thoughts?
6549792,Whopper,2021-04-13 04:48:00,340,"Looks good Smokey, another tool in the arsenal. Good for you getting two trips in last year"
6549842,brad34,2021-04-13 07:15:00,892,"I've used it on a few of my local lakes. It's a really cool feature. Sometimes it's surprising how much it can differ from the pre-loaded contours. I have not yet used the community maps, but I'll try to remember to check them out this year.The technology available to us is amazing when you stop to think about it."
6549908,stjoeguy,2021-04-13 09:52:00,979,"There's a river that flows into our favorite lake in Ontario that we enjoy fishing. The river is shallow except for the main channel that meanders all over. I've used Quickdraw to map the channel, which helps a lot. I've also used Quickdraw to map my own lake in MN. There are existing maps but making your own Quickdraw map is much more accurate and it's fun making the map!"
6549930,Skywagon,2021-04-13 11:15:00,1106,"This summer I plan on mapping the remote lake my cabin is on, looking forward to actually see the contrasts on a map. I have never mapped before, hoping it will be fairly simple to do, will be using my 93 for the task."
6550004,brad34,2021-04-13 14:30:00,892,It's very easy. You'll love it. I also have a 93SV.
6550146,skimottaret,2021-04-14 02:37:00,40,We used it on our last time on a fly in and really helped to understand the structure and dial in on spots once we found the correct depths. super useful to be able to record whilst trolling/searching for fish pods. Then flip the map back on to identify humps and structure. I have compared the Navionics 1 ft contours on Kabetogama to what we actually saw and very very different. Much more accurate on points etc. I recon the 1ft contours are just interpolated and the quickdraw is much more accurate
6550254,REG,2021-04-14 08:22:00,445,"I use it everywhere I go and agree it's awesome. Only thing I can add is that I got lucky on my transducer mount and I'll Quickdraw even when on plane and moving around between spots. It will tell you by the color of the boat icon that you aren't going at optimum speed, but it still draws. Not nearly as accurate as going slower, but it will easily pick up a hump or dip in the middle of the lake and you can go back and map it slower to get the better detail. It is a great, easy to use tool.."

6551304,Fishquest,2021-04-16 16:21:00,89,Nice to see a few people using the new technology and as mentioned the difference between the government supplied charts and the real thing is amazing. I'm finding a lot of changes and there not even close. As mentioned the speed travelling sure makes a difference on the sonar creating a real accurate defined maps. They say anything under 10kms will give you the most accurate mapping and I'd agree with that from what I see using it. I found last year on the 14ft camp boat with the 9.9 I was fine at full speed until the depths were over 40 ft then I seemed to lose the mapping but I expected that. When trolling it was constantly creating a cool map. Another feature I used on the map was changing the depth shading colours so I could target a certain depth and a quick glance at the sonar would tell me if I was in the the right area. I think it will be a cool thing for the fly in people once a better amount of mapping gets shared through the quickdraw community and you can download some to have a head start on trip planning all ready on your sonar unit. I put all the data from both my fly ins last year up and will do again this year if I'm lucky enough to go again. When looking at the quickdraw site its putting the basics up but when you down load some to your unit it comes up with a far better contour map. Looking in the area I generally fly to I'm see some other have shared as well so I see this as a good thing for the future. Mike
