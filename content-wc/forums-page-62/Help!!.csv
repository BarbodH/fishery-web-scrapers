6598658,valley366,2021-09-21 19:34:00,193,there was also someone on here that posted about getting injured in Ontario and had to come across the border to get medical attention. Then had to get a test to get back into Ontario. Referenced a place in International Falls that got results back in hours. Seems risky to drive all that way to there to get a test but may be an option.Many people have also posted about plenty of places in minneapolis area that maybe can swing through it that is your route.

6598560,pattmit,2021-09-21 12:18:00,36,I got a call that my appointment had to be canceled tomorrow due to Walgreens in Iowa is low or out of tests. No tests available in Des Moines or Ft Dodge. Does anyone have any info where I can go tomorrow to get my test. Many locations are out of tests or booked solid. We leave Friday morning for Ontario. Thanks in advance. We were going for the ID now test because of all the positive feedback from everyone but they will be out the remainder of the week.

6598600,NARDA 1,2021-09-21 14:53:00,636,Did you check with CVS Pharmacy or your doctors office? I was able to get the test through my doctors office and left the appointment with the results.
6598602,pattmit,2021-09-21 15:00:00,36,I have an appt at CVS tomorrow at 3:00. Itâ€™s a different test than the ID Now and my understanding is this PCR test goes to state hygienic lab and the results could take up to 3 days. We cross the boarder at 1pm Friday.
6598630,Obabikon,2021-09-21 17:42:00,2370,"I have had a couple of guests that didn't get their results back in time. The Pharmacy in Baudette MN is taking ""walk ins"" and you get the results in 15 minutes. I believe it's $100. All that said, call them, and double check. I also am encouraging everyone to only use this as an emergency backup plan. Otherwise, it could become overwhelmed."
6598632,Wallychowder,2021-09-21 17:48:00,1567,This late in the season ? I don't think it could become overwhelmed.
6598634,pattmit,2021-09-21 17:50:00,36,We are crossing at Ft Francis. I have some solid options tomorrow and should get it all worked out. Thanks all who helped out and sent me messages too
6598636,7 Mag,2021-09-21 17:51:00,1887,Here's another one that takes walk-in. http://www.covidquickresults.com/?fb...XvLyMY7rbge_s4
6598640,Obabikon,2021-09-21 17:55:00,2370,"I think they could. If they can only do 15-20 walk-ins per day... it wouldn't take much. As long as most people try to get tests at home, we'll be good."
