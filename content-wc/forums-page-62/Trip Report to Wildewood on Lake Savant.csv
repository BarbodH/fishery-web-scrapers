6596122,HeHooksHimself,2021-09-10 11:00:00,725,"I will start by saying this was one of our best September trips ever! Crossing- It was just Dock and I and our experience at the border was quite like our crossing in the morning of August 9, with one minor exception. No problem with the covid issues but when the question came up for how much tobacco we had I said we have some cigars but not exactly how many since we had a few on the way up. She said I needed to give her a number which I did since we knew we were legal. She gave us a yellow ticket for other officers to search our vehicle and said, ""you are crossing an international border, you should know exactly how many cigars you have, pull over there and someone will be with you."" Two other officers eventually showed up and we handed one of them all the cigars we had, which were conveniently all bagged together. He counted the cigars in the bag while the other opened all of the doors and looked through the car, but he did not pull anything out. After a few minutes the officer said the number I gave was wrong but you are still legal. Lesson learned- no guessing on numbers of anything when dealing with the Canadian Border officers. Camp- It is a long ride up to Lake Savant but about 5 1/2 - 6 hours after crossing the border (breakfast in Dryden included) finally met Todd and loaded up an ATV for the 3 1/2 mile trek up the very rough trail to the camp. The camp is on a meadow with no trees and cabins out in the open, so the privacy is not great. We were in Cabin 6 (a modern cabin, not a rustic cabin) which was great for just the two of us but would have been tight for four since the bunkbeds are in very small rooms. I would have preferred a screened-in porch but it is not to be had. Nice features are that the cabins all have electricity provided by a combination solar panels and a generator. Since there is limited internet I was able to communicate through email when necessary and an internet phone is available for limited use. Convenient for those that have to take business with them (NOT recommended!) One thing I love about Wildewood is that everything is provided. Cabin 6 qualified us for a very nice open area Alumicraft boat with a smooth running 25 hp elec. start yamahas. I love the fact that everything is included in the price. Every morning our minnow buckets would be full and the partially used gas tanks replaced with full ones. Also included was a top of the line Garmin depth finder that defines fish well and includes a feature that marks your track so you should never be lost. Another thing we thought was awesome is the opportunity to go fishing with Andy who showed us how to catch lake trout that are still deep and then let us use the rods and rigs for the rest of the week all at no extra charge (we dropped him $50 though). They have the coolest dogs in camp if you like dogs and I for one enjoyed having them around. Dock, not so much. Fishing- We caught so many walleyes it spun our heads. They were available any time of the day on a drift by the narrows and we found them almost everywhere we looked. We didn't really fish for northerns but only had a few bother us while walleye fishing. The walleye were healthy and we caught hundreds in the 17-18 inch range. There were also a lot of fish over 20 but we probably only caught a couple dozen over 23"" and our biggest was only 24"". Others in camp caught some up to 28"" but your dream fish is probably not here, unless your dream is volume. Andy took us fishing on Wednesday and we caught 3 trout with him. On our own we caught six more, the largest 26"". The weather was wet most of the week and the winds were usually stiff so we never ventured far from camp, probably never more that 1/2 hour from camp. The lake is huge and we have so much more to see! We highly recommend this place. We heard some scuttlebut around camp that the walleye don't really come down to the south end of the lake until July and that the bite stops in mid-September, but all I can share is our experience which was the walleye are thick and plentiful, voracious and easy to catch. What a pleasure it was to meet RichA$1970! We appreciated the crawlers and they worked as good as minnows It was great to put a face with a name. We also had a near miss meeting Pooch as he left a couple days before we got there. However, we appreciated the detaled map you sent us Pooch, it helped a lot! If you want to see what Pooch looks like, watch the video on Wildewood's web site. Well done Wildewood! We will be back! Fish On! Hooks"
6596176,jambi,2021-09-10 15:38:00,504,Awesome!
6596192,Carnhzkr,2021-09-10 16:42:00,964,That's what Pooch looked like 12 years ago!
6596202,RichA$1970,2021-09-10 17:50:00,1159,It was great meeting both of you and nice report. I fully agree I would go back and really enjoyed everything there.

6596246,pjshorthorn,2021-09-11 06:21:00,5654,Glad you fellas had a great trip. I'm leaving in 10 days for 9 days. We can catch up on trips at the Carolina game in October. PjShorthorn
6596374,phishfearme,2021-09-12 05:40:00,1242,"thanks - found them - they are much more centered on the lake and much smaller (4 cabins). their web site says there's ""three other lodges"" - one is wildewood - any idea what the other two are? thanks, phish"
6596478,Pooch,2021-09-12 17:11:00,4618,"Cliff & Roma's and Cat Track are basically the same local family and located next to each other separated by a small ""bay"". These camps are about in the middle of the lake and provide good access either north or south. That is a plus for those camps. There are a lot of islands all near the camp if you are not a ""traveler"".Wildewood is on a large narrow(ish) protected bay and a couple miles from the main portion of the mid-south end of the lake. Fishing in the WW bay on really nasty days is nice. It would be a long boat ride to reach the far north end of the lake from Wildewood. Most people realize that you need not travel to the other end of the lake to find really good fishing. There is little point in boating past good fishing just to get to other good fishing. Most of the best lake trout fishing is in the south half of the lake near Wildewood. Walleye are everywhere in the lake. There are spawning area all over the lake, but it's my understanding many spawn in the far north end of the lake. I doubt the walleye south of the narrows and mid-lake migrate to the very far north end outlet. There are numerous water inlets scattered around the lake and numerous bays and islands that offer protected fishing if needed.All three are good camps operated by good people. Wildewood is trail in while the other two are fly-in. All three camps have a good following of return guests. All three camps I would consider to be smaller camps of typical fly-in size and amenities. The lake does not receive a huge amount of pressure and fishing has been pretty consistent since I started fishing it in the mid nineties. The only place that receives pressure daily is the narrows. Fish away from the narrows and I doubt you will encounter or even see but a couple boats a day, at the most. Everyone seems to have their ""hot spot"" and mostly scatter to the wind each morning.The difference I notice is that Wildewood has a following of middle aged to older people and Cliff & Roma and Cat Track attract a seemingly younger crowd. The camps seem to offer a different experience from each other. All are relatively remote and offer a really good fishing experience. There is really good fishing near both camps. Any of these three camps would be a good choice.So many lakes and so little time......Pooch"
6596528,phishfearme,2021-09-12 20:11:00,1242,"Pooch - many thanks for the detailed reply - i thought when Cliff/Roma said there's three ""other"" lodges they meant Wildewood, cat track and one other - do you know of a third one? my concern with Wildewood was that they can house 30+ people and they would mainly fish in the south of the narrows week in and week out for the entire season since it's such a long ride out to the main lake. sounds like the southern bay is large enough and fertile enough to withstand the pressure. and i totally agree - soooooo many lake and sooooo little time - this is the main reason i value this board - all outfitters sound the same concerning fishing - WC members are much more reliable. thanks again, phish"
6596550,elway12,2021-09-12 22:54:00,335,The third camp is a outpost called Turtle Island - near a place called...Turtle island. Its near the upper end of Savant Lake.https://turtleislandoutpost.com/
6596570,Pooch,2021-09-13 05:57:00,4618,"I think, that outpost cabin is connected with Cliff and Roma's camp or family and not a camp, just an outpost cabin. That is what one of their guests told me a few years ago.""my concern with Wildewood was that they can house 30+ people""There are six cabins at Wildewood. I've never seen all of them occupied at once. Groups come and go so cabins sit empty between groups. About the same as most all other camps I've fished over the years. You are not trapped on the south end of the lake by any means. We regularly fish as far north as the Pine Island area to the Bear Paw area. About a forty five minute non stop ride, though we fish many spots on our way up and back looking for active fish. Seldom do we have to go that far to find cooperative fish.Savant has 90,000 acres of water and that is a lot of water to explore! Kind of like a miniature lac Seul, but easier and (mostly) safer to navigate. Savant is a stained water shield lake. LS is a reservoir with mostly sand/gravel and ""melting"" islands with lots of rock hazards. My replies are not meant as promoting any lake, I just want to share what I know about lakes I'm familiar with. I've only been to Cat Track and Cliff and Roma's camps a couple time to look around for alternative few years ago when Wildewood was for sale and to meet a guy I met here on WC years ago. I've not stayed there, but would in a heartbeat. I started staying at Wildewood when my wife and I made our first trip there in the mid 1990's and am comfortable there because of familiarity.There are so many great lakes and camps all across Ontario. Every one has something a little different (experience wise) to offer people.Our border crossing at Pigeon River was painless as we were nearly over prepared because of the people sharing info here on WC. My other group headed for LS the same time crossed at IF and had one guy chosen for a spot check in Fort Francis and it delayed them an hour and a half. They had a couple younger guys with them that were familiar with video stuff and it went smoothly, but just took some time to work through. Hopefully next year will be different.Pooch"
6596622,phishfearme,2021-09-13 09:19:00,1242,"turtle island seems like a very nice little outpost - and miles away from anything else. will have to look into it. thanks for the responses, phish"
6596774,RichA$1970,2021-09-13 16:52:00,1159,I will just add staying at Wildewood I never felt crowded or pressured on the lake or at the camp. So much lake to explore I would just consider the Narrows as a land mark for reference.
6597070,NM_Trout,2021-09-14 17:01:00,1094,Isn't that the truth. An ideal retirement for me would be to spend summers bouncing from one lake to the next!
6596248,Pooch,2021-09-11 06:52:00,4618,"Good report HeHooksHimself. Wildewood used to be a fly-in camp when we started going there in the mid 1990s. There were a LOT of trees and it was always hot with no breeze as it is located in the bush and surrounded by tall pines. I don't remember when, but a large storm came through (early 2000s?) and dropped most of the trees onto cabins and pulled down all of the electrical. The owner had a really big job ahead of him to clear the camp and get electricity restored. IMO getting rid of a lot of the trees made the camp much better. Now you can get a breeze and air moving around camp. Before it would get really hot in the summer. Plus the skeetters were really bad back then. When we were in camp just prior to ""Hooks"" I saw many people fishing the narrows day and night. The narrows is pretty unique in that all the water in the lake flows through an opening about eight foot deep and maybe thirty feet wide. There is always current there and in the evening gets a lot of pressure. So there are scads of 15-20"" fish there in the evenings and many times during the day light hours, too. As people get more comfortable with the lake they will start stretching their legs further out to other parts of the lake and find much more good fishing and new scenery. I've learned that you can (on occasion) catch a much larger walleye in the narrows, though it is usually full of ""eaters"" most of the time. Larger fish can be found in deeper water near the narrows. The fishing pressure pushes them out and deeper until it gets quiet. That is how they got to be be bigger fish! There is a phenomenon that I have never seen anywhere else that sometimes happens in the narrows later in the evening. The fish will suddenly stop biting and on your depth finder screen you will see a black or heavily shaded area appear just off the bottom and it grows larger. Sometimes nearly blanking out your screen. I think we finally figured out that it is plankton. When that starts the bite for the evening is probably over. This year is only the second time I've fished Savant at the end of August first of September and both times the lake fished very different from our June, July and early August trips of the past. Which is to be expected. Fish were transitioning off of the sunken islands, mid lake humps back towards where ever they go in the fall. Probably slowly easing towards and following bait fish to where ever they also go in the fall. We found most of our summer hot spots nearly devoid of fish. Fish were on the move and had to be located for best fishing. (meaning larger fish) I had another group of buddies fishing Lac Seul the same week and they found the same as above. I don't get to fish Savant as much as I used to, but it is one of the most productive producers of football shaped walleye around. It does not produce huge ""numbers"" like LS, but it produces as many or more ""pounds"" than LS. Size? If a lake has a lot of healthy, fat 20-25"" fish then there has to be a lot of much larger fish in there somewhere. It is just a matter of figuring out (or stumbling onto) where they are and what they want. Every fish over 27 inches and up to an honest 29.75"" walleye I've caught over the years fishing Savant, Lac Seul, Birch, etc. came from Lake Savant. LS has the potential for more numbers of larger fish than Savant, but do not under estimate the potential of Savant for large fish. You just have to learn the lake, read the lake and pick up the ""rhythm"" of the lake at that moment. The largest Northern Pike I've ever seen in my life was near the narrows about fifteen years ago. At first glance I thought it was a large sturgeon until I realized that there are no sturgeon in Savant. Got him to the surface and got a really good look then he just sank back into the depths like a ghost breaking my line. That is one fish picture in my mind I will take to the grave with me. I'm still dumbfounded by the shear broadness of it's body and the overall length of that fish..... They are there. It was good to meet Rich and his partner Fred. Would like to have met Hooks, but we had been there twelve days and it was time to get home and back to work. Maybe next time! Pooch"
6596298,gordy28,2021-09-11 10:51:00,437,Hooks and Pooch. Awesome to see reports from both of you. Glad you were able to get back to your happy places and glad it was a good experience Cheers Andrew
6596312,phishfearme,2021-09-11 12:46:00,1242,"great reports guys - thanks.isn't there another outfitter more at the center of the lake?i looked at wildewood years ago and was a bit concerned about all their guests being focused on the south end of the lake.thanks,phish"
6596358,RichA$1970,2021-09-11 18:24:00,1159,Cliff and Roma’s as it’s a fly in and they are like 18 miles north. You will see a few as they only 9.9’s but no issues at all as the lake is huge.
