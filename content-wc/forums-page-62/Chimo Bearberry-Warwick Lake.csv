I have been going with Chimo for many years including Hornby/Marvin/Schultz/Roderick/Culverson/Keeper but this will be the first trip to Bearberry (and my girl friends first trip ever to Canada!) We are flying out Monday 9/6 but will only be staying for 4 or 5 days. Any advice/hazards/must see scenery would be most appreciated!!"

That said, I've always heard excellent reports. I've been interested in Bullock Lake forever as I heard the walleyes are on steroids there. Looking forward to hearing about your trip when you return."

6598576,Pink Unicorn,2021-09-21 13:33:00,83,"Hill,Penny on here marked a map along with the guys coming out. To be honest, we struggled. The lake was very nice, loved the setting and the beach right by the cabin. We averaged 15 fish/day fishing from 11:00-3:00 every day and a couple times in the evening. Water temp was 61 degrees, average daily high 62/50 low. Wind, rain, sun. We caught them from 20-34' but I don't fish deeper than that due to the swim bladder. 3/8 jig with white or smoke or black 5"" kalins twister tipped with frozen minnow or worm. All things considered, it should still be a great lake but I seem to struggle on larger, deep lakes in the fall. I have done very well at this time of year at Schlutz, Marvin and Keeper but Roderick and now Warwick have beaten me.Main basin is over 80' and has lots of mid lake structure in the sweet spot. I think bottom bouncers would be very effective. We fished all of the rapids and caught fish but nothing like what it must be like in the spring. One interesting thing I found is that the structure was different than most lakes I've fished. Way less rocks and boulders- more smoothed out humps and valleys. This leads me to believe in the later part of the year the fish are roaming more instead of staying tight on a spot. We would catch 2 or 4 pretty quick and it would go dead. Move around a bit in reverse/neutral +/- 10' and nothing. I would love to check out the lake again earlier in the season with a bigger group and spend more time hunting. Everything about the setup makes for a special lake."
