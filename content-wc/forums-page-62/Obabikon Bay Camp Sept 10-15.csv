6598540,gowrlop,2021-09-21 10:08:00,109,"I was blessed again to fish the fine waters of Lake of the Woods in Ontario September 10-15. After fishing all over Ontario and Manitoba for the past 40 years, there's just something special about the Ontario side of Lake of the Woods for me. This trip was solo, and I go to enjoy the historic Obabikon Bay Camp. It has always been on my list, and I was so pleased to finally stay there. I was also very happy to support Jerad and his family. He has been a tireless advocate for all of us fisherman dealing with this COVID / boarder debacle. I crossed he boarder at Baudette / Rainy River. I selected 9:00am in the arrivecan app and pulled up exactly at 9:00am. No vehicle in front of me and no one behind me. The interaction with the agent was friendly, smooth, quick and all good, until he smiles and handed me the dreaded blue box. ""Sir, you've been chosen to do a random COVID test"". Well, I'm so excited to get back up there, frankly, I didn't care. I drove up the road to Rainy River and parked in the driveway of a friends house. After greeting my friend, I began to unbox the blue box. I followed the instructions and got to the part of the video chat. It said I was #35 in the que and should hear from someone in about an hour. As I was starting to get frustrated, a voice of a young lady said, ""Good morning Mr. Brown"". there she was, just a matter of a few seconds. I did my test, she watched and instructed me during the short process. Our video shat did go dark a few times because of the poor service in Rainy River and frankly, that caused some more frustration. After under the watchful eye of the nurse, I fully sanitized the plastic bag and placed it in the mailing box. The drop off location is across the street from my friend's house. What is just wonderful is the Purolator drop off location is an auto mechanics and part store and they have a ""garbage can"" outside with a sign, ""COVID test here"" with an arrow pointing to the can. The entire process took an hour - well worth it. The fishing was extremely good. I hit the water each morning at 7:30am and returned to the docks at 5:30. My preferred way to fish that time of the year is throwing a 3/8 lead head paired with a 5 inch jerk shad or paddle tail. Those walleyes, northerns, and smallmouth bass love big minnow style baits this time of year. I had a couple days where I caught well over 100 fish a day. The lowest day total was 68 fish. I fished long points with flats on them in the 16 to 25 foot range being the best. Sitting in 30 to 26 feet and throwing the minnow baits up on the flat and working it back. Obabikon Bay Camp was everything I thought it would be and more. The staff was extremely accommodating and friendly. The food was great and the portions where on the extremely large side. You gotta love a place where a trained chef is slinging minnows in the morning and crafting a savory chicken marsala for dinner. The location of the camp in Obabikon Bay is a beautiful part of the lake. I spent the last three hours of each day on the deck wrapped around the gazebo over the water. Enjoying a fine cigar and a couple or three large J.P. Wisers whiskey while enjoying the view. Each night I watched the comings and goings of a plethora of eagles, ducks, geese, pelicans and many more. As the sun set and the moon, planets and stars brightened, it provided another type of beautiful scenery. I can't thanks Jared, his family and all camp owners whom have worked so hard to help get the boarder open. These places are so special and enjoyed by so many. Best of luck to all. Roger Brown"

6598570,steve.a,2021-09-21 13:25:00,274,Were you able to get in Obabikon Lake with the low water? If so were the crappie in the elbow?
6598580,1shooter,2021-09-21 13:40:00,1493,I was there 3 weeks ago and yes you can back to that lake. It is extremely low but be careful and you will make it through.
6598584,gowrlop,2021-09-21 13:41:00,109,"Steve a, Beings I was alone I did not attempt to enter Obabikon Lake. I do have some friends that have a cabin on an island just west of Obabikon Bay. They have the same boat as mine (Skeeter WX 2060) and they went to Obabikon Lake the day before I stopped. They caught 15 nice crappies but I didn't ask exactly where they fished. I also visited with another group in the fish cleaning shack that had a real nice mess of crappies. They told me they caught them in Obabikon Lake but again nothing specific. Roger"
