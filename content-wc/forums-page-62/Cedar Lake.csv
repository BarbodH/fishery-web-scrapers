Also went over to Cedar Point Resort and fished with the 2 Jim's for crappie but never found them but did manage around 80 plus walleyes.They did fish the same spots the following day and found some.Smallmoutgs were also on the feed bag. Great week of weather also.The muskie boys let me fish with them and I did manage a 48 1/2"" fish.Awesome week on a awesome lake.Walleye fishing is absolutly fantastic and there are certain spots where you can't drop a jig without a bite.Hope it continues as ill be busy again.Cool mornings with fog.Water temps hanging in around 65F. Some rain in forecast and slight temp drop but everything should be good."
