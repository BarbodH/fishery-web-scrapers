6596658,Springstead,2021-09-13 11:12:00,12,Our group of 6 is planning on crossing over the Baudette border later this week. Needless to say we are all very excited to be finally going to Canada once again. I've been reading lots of post and researching in preparation of a hopefully smooth border crossing and great fishing trip. 1) we understand that no live bait or dead bait is allowed so none will be with us when we cross. 2) We've all been vaccinated and have our vac cards and will be doing the Walgreens ID Now test within 72 hours of crossing the border. 3) Regarding the ArriveCAN app I'm a little unclear if everyone needs to do it on their own or if the driver of the car crossing does it and includes the passengers in their car? Our group is six so 3 cars with 2 persons per vehicle as we are bringing up our own boats. Looking for help on how to best do this. 4) Does anyone have experience with being randomly selected for Covid test at this border? I understand that we need to have a good internet connection and that we need do this before we move onto our camp (which does have wifi connection but is on an island) . If we are selected does anyone know where the Purlator drop off location is in Rainy River? I thought I read somewhere that this can be dropped of a the Post which I believe is the equivalent of a USA Post office? 5) any word on lake of the woods water levels and locations of walleyes? Our group will be fishing 75% muskies and 25% walleyes. I look forward to hearing back from you fellow fisherman on this website.

You then will follow the instructions in the box and call to talk with a nurse… They will walk you through the process and then it will be mailed in. They do like you to do it before you leave town, but you don’t have to… If you will have Internet access where you are going.Water levels are very low. 18 to 24 inches below normal. While I fishing has been great, and they are in all the normal fall spots. Muskie fishing is very good also… Rocks, broken down with beds, beaches… The usual stuff"

If you do not have a vax card holder I suggest you get one. This is not required but was suggested by the boarder agent. Here is a link of what they look like. https://www.amazon.com/Vaccination-P.../dp/B0924NTMSF 3. You can do it either way they actually never asked for the info from the arrivecan app it just populates when they check your ID. 4. If you do not have internet you can request a call from switch health and a nurse will call you and you can have your sample picked up from an address of were you are staying. I called them and they were very helpful with the questions I had. 5. Water level was down 2-2.5 feet. Walleyes will be on there summer, fall structure flats,points, reefs, next to deep water. If you are fishing muskies the walleyes should not be far from the same places you are fishing. Good Luck and wear your mask at the boarder and wait for the agent to tell you what to do."

Most of them smaller than normal. 26"" was the biggest. 19"" smallmouth was the biggest. We usually fish for Musky also but not this time. You can put both people in your car on the same arriveCan I did but my phone wouldn't let me answer a question it just froze I tried several times. The agent at the border looked at my phone and finished it for me. Not sure what I did wrong cause he didn't have any problems. He just laughed and poke fun of me. Rained every day off and on and the wind blew every day. Not sure on sending the self test with the PO. I think it has to be the carrier they suggested. The Lake is down probably 2ft right now. Alot of rocks showing that you don't normally see. Have a great trip."

We pulled over in same parking lot as canada border shack and did our test there. We all did it separately and had waits from 10-45 minutes on the phone. I was lucky enough to go first and be the guinea pig. After completing, there was a drop box .9 miles away at a repair shop.The drop box was a garbage can! The day (9/11) we were leaving back to US we received our results. Interestingly, Switch Health is trying to send me a second test (which your suppose to take if staying more than 8 days which we were not). I have been contacted via text, email and telephone! I keep telling them I am back in US but Switch Health has sent daily emails to verify the address of the resort we were staying at."

I suspect the border agent had all of the information that we entered at his fingertips upon scanning our passports. We were asked for our passports first, then our vaccination cards, and finally our COVID test results. We were asked the standard questions about alcohol, tobacco, firearms, where we were going, how long we were going to stay, etc. A very professional and polite conversation. He then said have a nice trip and off we went. This was this past week (9/10 border crossing and 9/18 return)."
