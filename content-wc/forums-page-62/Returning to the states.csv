6597760,dakota eye,2021-09-17 12:22:00,69,"Just crossed the border at Emerson. It was a walk in the park. Asked about our fish, looked at our passports and sent us on our way."
6598058,Twins_dad,2021-09-19 07:49:00,38,Crossed yesterday in Fort Francis 5 minutes no issues.
6598094,NARDA 1,2021-09-19 10:23:00,636,"Same here, crossed at about 8:30am. Didn't even have to pay duty on extra whiskey I brought back."
6598284,Mojo-NC,2021-09-20 09:04:00,1929,"We crossed back into the US at International Falls/Ft Francis on Saturday, 9/18. We pulled up at about 5:00 PM and were the only vehicle in line. None of us were wearing masks and he didn't say a word about it. He asked the standard questions, but nothing about fish (we didn't have any) or COVID. He also did not ask to see our vaccination cards. Once he checked our passports and realized that we were all from North Carolina he correctly assumed that we were driving a rental vehicle and he asked to see a copy of the agreement. I did not have a paper copy but provided an electronic copy of the rental agreement on my phone and he was fine with it. He was extremely professional and polite and we were in return. Easy peasy; we were on our way to catch our flight home in a matter of about 2 minutes total."
6595774,dakota eye,2021-09-09 07:25:00,69,Any issues with crossing the border getting back to the states guys? Any updates? Thx!
6595780,guidedfishing,2021-09-09 07:54:00,531,"No issues, we were asked the same questions as always, handed passport, another agent did look in boat and back of truck but it was not a serious inspection. 3 guys in the truck from pulling up to the gate, answer questions and quick inspection probably was not even 4 mins total."
6595786,1shooter,2021-09-09 08:04:00,1493,no issues at all. We even had 2 people in our group with expired passports and just a normal drivers license.
6595802,fishingMN4eyes,2021-09-09 08:57:00,108,Not for us back in August. When we crossed they were checking everyone's fish but it wasn't a major delay or anything. Just have your fish and your Canadian fishing license readily accessible should you happen to get checked.
6595806,Eagle1,2021-09-09 09:23:00,28,"No issues for us coming over last Saturday 9/4. Drove up to the front of the line around 1pm, handed him our passports and answered the typical questions. Took less than 2 minutes or so."
6595874,rather-be-fishin,2021-09-09 14:24:00,429,Crossed at Int'l Falls at 11am ON 9/3. We just gave passport. Minimal questions took a couple of minutes. How was your trip & where did you go? RBF
6595918,Hwy101,2021-09-09 17:21:00,18,"We crossed on 9-3. I would describe the agent as frosty to border line hostile. I did not see another car in the area crossing back to the USA. I didn't understand why one of the agents felt it was necessary to stand in front of my truck until the lady in the window said I could pass. In my head head I wrote it off as "" I'm from Wisconsin and your 0-4 in Super Bowls"". Still not as bad as crossing from Juarez MX."
6596034,eyecatcher1,2021-09-10 06:24:00,323,"The wife and I crossed at International Falls at 11:30 AM August 23. He asked if I had fish, rocks or purchased anything in Canada. I said ""No"" and he said ""Welcome Back."" Took maybe 30 seconds."

Agent: Where are you guys from? Me: Indiana, sir. We were fishing. Agent: You bringing any fish back? Me: Yes, sir. 4 walleyes each, 8 total. Agent: Welcome back. That was it!"
