We have spotty cell service at our camp and there is actually very spotty cell service on Lac Seul itself. We were fishing one day and my brother had his phone in his pocket. Ring Ring. Was sort of funny. We stay at Onaway and like I said, spotty. There are times we get it depending on where you are. Times we have to go outside, stand in certain spot to get it. If we had troubles, we hopped in teh truck and drove up the drive out to the HWY and just parked. Were able to call home etc fine from there.Don't think you would be able to use it as a GPS on the lake though. Also, heads up, your data rates etc may apply if you are doing that as well. I don't have an iphone but you have to make sure your plan allows international calling. Also, to use local towers you sometimes have to reset your phone. I will have to look that up before I go but it's like *2289 or something like that? Hit send and it programs your phone to use local towers."
2002065,rommel,2013-08-02 19:33:00,369,i just came back from lac seul and had ok reception on lake. i used navionics app on my droid to navigate the whole lake. it will work without data as long as you download the area of canada your fishing before you go. turn your data off at the border or expect one helluva bill
2002281,tmoreau,2013-08-02 21:34:00,3,"I can answer that question we have two main providers in Lac Seul, I'm new to the forums and work for LSFN. Yes there is cell service in the area we recently put up a 2g cellists in Kejick Bay, but the antennas were pointed too far down so our ell coverage there is a ill shotty. We also have Tbaytel in the region and the only other competitor. So hopefully we fix this problem before you come back next year but if you buy a cell booster it would help your cell service. Kmobile and Tbaytel have a Rogers agreement. Bell Mobility is in Dryden now and currently the biggest provider and slowly making our way near Sioux Lookout and the ear falls side of Lac Seul waters. I know quite a few of the camp owners on the Sioux Lookout side though. And a few in the red lake and Dryden area. I'd be happy to provide info on camps and potential guides local natives that could go out with you during the time anyone comes up."
