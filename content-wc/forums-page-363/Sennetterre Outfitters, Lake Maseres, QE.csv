2005385,pitbull,2013-08-04 17:27:00,45,"Just returned from a week of crazy weather, the wind didn't stay the same for two days in a row. Rain, Cold Fronts ect. The last ten miles of roadway access is a lot for desire (Brush closing in). On arrival, we were greeted well, told the cabin were staying in. Cabin was in fair condition, fridge/New Stove worked. Shower part needs holes closed off and roof repaired as it leaks in middle of shower. Access road hasn't changed, you need 4-wheeled drive to access docks if you don't want to carry gear back and fourth. I didn't see any sign of upgrades to enhance more fisher persons. Boats are good, 15hp 4-Strokes good on gas. Really have to look out for rocks as lake is not marked for rocky areas. All ways Buy Lic. before going back to camps as it is a Hundred mile trip each way!! May Flies hatch was over about a week ago, really late this year, still seen some floating. One person from other camp hooked onto a large Sturgeon, but lost it. Fishing was tough. Liked the lake, lots of structure, surface temp changed 4-5 deg. in a day. Would I go back? Probley Not."
