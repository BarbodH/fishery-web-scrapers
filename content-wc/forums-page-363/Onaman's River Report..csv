While it is always nice to see pictures of big walleye's, pike and trout I really enjoyed reading about your interactions with your daughter. I am sure it is a trip you will both remember. The ""laid to rest"" section was very well done and a good tribute to a fellow outdoorsman.."

I was there a couple of years ago and conditions/equipment wasn't so kind to me and my son on that trip, but yet I am still in love with the area. Thanks for the pics and the report, it must have taken alot of your time to put together such an enjoyable read."
