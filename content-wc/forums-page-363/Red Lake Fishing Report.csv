1988762,bergsh,2013-07-28 20:47:00,183,We had a great week up there. We found that we hit a lot smaller fish than normal. Though we caught a ton of them. The big mayfly hatch that happened seemed to mean that night crawler chunks were about as good as bait to use as anything. Seemed to have to head west for larger fish.
1991610,stevensinks,2013-07-29 20:27:00,330,"My wife and I just got back from Bow Narrows. We landed more fish this year than ever before. We drifted and backtrolled for walleye and casted for pike. Crawlers seemed to work the best for walleye. But we had a hard time finding the larger ones. It was cool , damp , windy and we had a GREAT time. Just 51 weeks and we will be back."
2000473,BigBehr,2013-08-02 08:22:00,16,I have never fished Upper Red in the summer and am wondering if there are any structure that a person should look for? From what I know about the lake is that it is a big bowl? We are heading up there the weekend of the 8/16/13. Any advice would be great.
1957081,bergsh,2013-07-17 08:35:00,183,Headed up to Red Lake this weekend. Wondering how the fishing is? Are the walleyes east or west? Any advice on depth?
1957729,Mondo,2013-07-17 12:10:00,61,"From what I've heard, the late ice-out has caused a bit of a challenge this year. Most fish seem to be still in the east end ~ usual places like East Bay, Chukuni, etc. Mayflies should be about done. Hatch lasted a couple of weeks so hopefully the 'eyes will be waiting for you. Best of luck. P.S. If you plan on using leeches, they seem to be in short supply ~ about $42-45 / lb."

1965025,cwb,2013-07-19 17:39:00,13,"Dave,We usually backtroll harnesses to find them then sit on them and jig em up.For the most part the fish are deeper 17-30 ft but that varies.I'll post a report when we get back!"
1966241,dman617,2013-07-20 06:15:00,117,"When I go there later than June, fish are usually in deeper water 20-30'. We are on St. Paul's Bay at a cabin for my stay. Always fish out by Burnt Island, Fisher Islands, in 20' +. Sometimes the pesky little ones can be avoided by using a harness and faster moving bait. I was there in early-mid June and caught plenty to eat, but nothing big. Back trolling was by far the best. Limits everyday. Even tried to pull in a 45"" northern by stringer rope as he was eating my catch off the stringer. Couldn't get him up high enough to get him in the net. It hung around that stringer for about 10 minutes."
