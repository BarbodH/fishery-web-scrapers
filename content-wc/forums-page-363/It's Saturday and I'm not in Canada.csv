I'm deep in the planning stages for next year so we don't have the issues we had this year with people backing out at the last minute, well in May which is pretty late to reorganize for July, and planning is a big part of the fun anyway. Just ordered a new production mold so I can pour jigs faster in the sizes I use most and with the hooks I prefer; sharper out of the box and with a little wider gap. Thanks to this site I will also have plenty of coppertone next year, too. There's still plenty of fishing to be had around here but it is mostly very early and very late because of boat and canoe traffic. In fact, I'll be out from 11 until 1 or 2 tonight chasing big trout which is another kind of fishing I look forward to all year. Grouse season is only 6 weeks away, salmon are inching towards the rivers, as are the big Lake Michigan walleye and the last big hatch of the year will be starting in about 10 days. The fall smallmouth will be turning on shortly, too. I know the grass is always greener, it just seems to be amazingly green in Canada, ya know?"

Whether a lodge is used is irrelevant, the deposit is sizable enough and non refundable that more commitments are made up front and rarely does anyone back out. And the good thing was that an irregular group of guys became a regular group of comrades during at least one week out of the year. And another good thing was that if someone did back out, the trip just got less expensive for everyone else. Sorry you couldn't make your trip."

My trip was a couple of weeks ago but it ended up being to a lake that wasn't our first choice and the fishing was disappointing. The guys who backed out ate the deposit on the first place but the cost was driven up so high, I ended up paying 80%, that we had to go to a cheaper place. My boys had a great time and I learned a valuable lesson, ask about DUI's. Right now I'm just jonesing to get the trip I had hoped for. Next year. I just got back from some late night trout fishing, throwing mouse imatations and never nowing how bih the fish is until it is in the net. It's an adrenalin filled way to fish and you can catch some real monters. I got some nice ones, lost some nice ones and spooked a beaver or something large who spooked me back when he splashed about 10' away. In a couple of weeks we're doing a family trip to the maritime provinces and that may lead to a little fishing if I can make a left at Montreal and head up into the Laurentians a bit. Kind of a long shot but if the boys are up for it I might convince the wife. If not I'll just waid for next year, unless the guy I know with a cabin on Windermere decides to go again the one week I have time in Sept. Another long shot."
