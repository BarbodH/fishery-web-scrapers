2008929,trapperbob,2013-08-05 19:50:00,45,Try Ganglers in Manitoba. Part of the north seal river system. We where there several years ago and stayed at one of the mini lodges called Maria lake. Pike fishing was fantastic. Plus there was another lake that you portaged to that was full of pike. Lake Maria also has lake trout but no walleye. There was a manager on site with meals provided. There are several other choices to fish. The camp had electricity and very nice boats with a casting platform in the bow. Unlimited gas and is catch and release. Have to use barbless hooks or crimp the barbs.
