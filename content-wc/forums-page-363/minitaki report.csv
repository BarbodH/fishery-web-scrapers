1986874,kordman,2013-07-27 22:49:00,5,Heading to minitaki next week. Looking for fishing report and what's working. Chasing walleyes and big northerns. Can't wait to get my line wet.
1987594,Dogbreath,2013-07-28 10:32:00,494,"Was there last week and fishing was not as easy as previous years. Water is up quite a bit and we found no fish to mention in our regular spots.We got quite a few, but had to work harder and longer for them.some in camp were going all the way down to the end of Red Pine and English river. Even the reef was not producing as normal.We thought it looked to be getting better towards the end of the week.Good luck"

Fishing around Burnt Hut Island and the surrounding area proved to be productive using leeches on Lindy Rigs in 15 to 20 feet of water. Slow backtrolling worked best. We caught our fill of walleyes each day and then some. Many fish in the slot and above as well though our largest was not a giant - - 24"". Still many beautiful fish and enough to eat and take a few home as well. We were thrilled with the fishing quality and the accommodations at TEC and it is the best deal, in terms of price. The owner, Kevin, is an exceptionally friendly and helpful person. We would highly recommend this location. All in all each person caught 50 to 75 Walleyes in 4 days of fishing and also many northern pike with the largest (38"") weighing in at 15#. Enjoy your trip!"
2001801,scar,2013-08-02 16:23:00,196,Leaving on Wednesday at 4am. Hope to be fishing by 4pm. Will fish 3 days on Minnitaki and 1 on Lac Seul. Any new reports on Minnitaki or south east lac seul?

Our biggest pike was just over 40"" and the biggest walleye was 25"". We had a couple of fair days and the rest were slow. The water temp was 62 degrees which is by far the coldest I remember. It was fairly cool and windy most days. We found the fish on humps and points as usual for this time of year. The fish were also deep."
