2002289,tmoreau,2013-08-02 21:35:00,3,Which camp you planning to stay at?
2002962,scar,2013-08-03 10:52:00,196,"TMOREAU, We are staying on Minnitaki but plan on landing, loading and driving to Deception or Hudson Landing. Hoping I can get some info on what area of Lac seul is good in August so I know what landing and what general area of the lake to fish including depth, structure and presentation. I have fished Lac Seul often in June but we go all the way to Bear Narrows area and then fish 3 -12' max. Hoping I don't need to travel that far either."
2003130,jimirjr,2013-08-03 13:25:00,1149,"I, too, have an interest in this info.... We wanna plan a Mid Sept. HB trip for 2014. I have heard the Fall season is tougher fishing than in June? BUT... FALL is SO BEAUTIFUL...."
2005145,ScottL,2013-08-04 15:24:00,733,"We fished that area July 18th -21st. Stayed in Sioux Lookout and trailered to Deception Bay Access each day. Our best fishing was in the area between Maclean Narrows and Bear Narrows. Jig and a minnow 20-28 FOW on mid lake reefs. We also fished the Deception Bay area the first day and fished Sen Bay one day. We caught fish in all of those areas but it was much better in the Bear Narrows area both size and numbers. It's about a 30 mile jaunt by boat, but it was worth it. At that time the water level was high enough for us to run thru the Rags, which shortens the trip. There were also boats running all the way from Sioux Lookout thru the Pelican Falls, but I have never done it and just maybe a little chicken."
