1997818,pikeandtina,2013-08-01 07:34:00,145,Stayed there while fly-fishing the area.
1999914,bigdog8837,2013-08-01 21:54:00,30,Yea there lots of nice small river for trout around Webster but i like walleye and smallmouth. I guess you always want what you don't have.
2000113,pikeandtina,2013-08-02 05:14:00,145,"Haha, isn't that the truth! That's why I go to Canada as well, LOL!"
2000281,octanehi5,2013-08-02 06:56:00,1104,"You may want to check out Air Tamarac, they have some very nice family plans in the summer,that are in your price range that are fly in trips,with not many people on the lakes, Places on the Gouin and Lac Hebert In Quebec Province, drive straight up Interstate 81 to Canada. I spent my 10th yr on Lac Hebert this yr. You will not find a better fishery in Quebec"
1991801,bigdog8837,2013-07-29 22:38:00,30,"I am looking for a new lodge to go fishing in canada. The most important thing for me is great fishing. This means to me being able to catch lots fish including walleye, smallmouth bass and pike, and the average numbers being around 25 a day. I want a drive to with the american plan. It must have a big boat that is comfortable to fish from. The final thing is a price for around 900.00 for the week. If you have any idea's please let me know. My experience in Canada is mostly in the easter part of Ontario. I have been to Eagle Lake once and really enjoyed that but most of the lodges on this lake are a little out of my price range. I have been going to Canada for 15 years now. I live in West Virginia so the Western part of Ontario is about as far as I would like to drive. Any help will be great. Thanks in advance. https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...c/progress.gif"
1992113,BornToFish,2013-07-30 07:28:00,1224,I fish from Manotak Lodge in NW Ontario about six weeks per year. It seems to fit the criteria that you set forth. Here is a link:http://www.manotak.com/There are many great lodges in Ontario. I hope you find the one that fits best. Regards.....

1992865,@Lunker,2013-07-30 11:37:00,835,"www.witchbay.comMaybe a bit pricier than you're looking for, but great food, great service and GREAT fishing. All 4 major species present - walleye, smallies, northern, and muskie; as well as the incidental jumbo perch. They get people coming from as far away as Colorado, Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, New York and Mass. on an annual basis. Your desired goal of 25 fish a day would be considered awful, post-cold front numbers for LOTW. Set your goals higher, go to Witch Bay and blow the doors off."
1992929,troutwater,2013-07-30 11:48:00,299,"Not trying to hijack, but I've always wanted to try this place. The fishing looks great along with the location, it's just pretty darn expensive. Is it worth it?"
1993713,NARDA 1,2013-07-30 17:09:00,636,I sent you a private message.
1993785,Blades-n-Beads,2013-07-30 17:54:00,484,"Big dog . I have fished very close to witch bay And specifically that portion of LOW. You will not be disapointed with fish quality and the bonus sumo perch!! I have not stayed with witch bay but have heard nothing but great things about there facility, staff and gear. We fish that area 3 times a year and will continue to because of the great fishing and great people. Heading back to that area in 3 weeks. Give them a call and book yourself a great fishing experience."
1994305,@Lunker,2013-07-30 21:40:00,835,What can I say.....Blades 'n Beads beat me to it. In a word.....YES!
1994337,dog2,2013-07-30 21:54:00,198,try AWO [artic wilderness outfitters] out of nakina. Great people to do business with several great lakes and great fishing 25 fish a day is usually a first drift on most lakes.
