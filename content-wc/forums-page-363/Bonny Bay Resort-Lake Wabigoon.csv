1447509,Robert Cardenas,2012-06-10 22:19:00,138,"Hey guys, not sure about the comments about stopping the thread, this thread is for people who fish Wabigoon, people who stay at Bonny Bay Resort, and fun things that people look forward to as they travel to there resort. I will not be negative here because I'm not the negative type and you can tell I am not trying to hide who I am! I have actually talked to many locals because of this thread and received much help when I needed it to get my boat fixed. I can say I have made new friends from Dryden. It was actually pretty cool to see how many people on Walleyecentral actually go to Lake Wabigoon and how many stay at Bonny Bay Resort from this thread. If I'm to positive about Bonny Bay Camp there is a reason. They have top notch cabins, top notch Lodge that is huge-handy during the bad weather days, top notch hospitality, the whole camp is treated like family for a week. I am not being negative towards any other canadian camps, I have stayed at a lot, and Bonny Bay Camp just happens to be a 5 star for many. This thread would be doubled if all the P.M's I have received were posted, and their all from locals and people who are staying at resorts on Wabigoon/Dinorwic, and Hunting in the area! Oh yea one more thing, good luck to all the people fishing the Masters Derby on Wabigoon and stay safe! This is about growing the sport, helping the sport and supporting many good people. Here is a few more pics from our trip--"
1447514,115 optimax,2012-06-10 22:39:00,650,"Well said Robert.I was on the Bonny Bay Camp web site and it does look like a nice place to stay,lots of nice walleye photos two."
1485579,Robert Cardenas,2012-09-11 19:44:00,138,"Does anyone have any pictures to share from Lake Wabigoon this spring or summer. I hear the Muskies are on fire, just got done looking at the Bonny Bay Camp website with many 50""ers being caught. Would like to see a few of those. Hope all is well up in Dryden!"
2001097,michaelp,2013-08-02 12:08:00,14,"I leave for the goon in 2 weeks for the first time. We are looking forward to the variety of fishing opportunities. I would appreciate any advice on patterns to fish. Not looking for your hotpots, I hope to find my own. I like the challenge of new water, but knowing what pattern to target would help me out. Thanks in advance. We arrive at BB on 8/17. I have a black Lund Angler SS. Say hi if you wish, will share success and failure."
2001257,Skywagon,2013-08-02 13:09:00,1106,"Since you have your own boat and are so close, you should grab a guide to show you around the west side of Lac Seul for a day (there is a public ramp on Scout Bay), would be time well spent. Looking forward to your review."
2001737,115 optimax,2013-08-02 16:11:00,650,"Slip bobbers in 3-5ft of water on top of any reef with a decent size top on it.Be patient,the fish seem to come in waves.I anchor up wind and let the waves take the bobber across the top.Nice Walleye and Bass are caught this way.Good luck!If you end up in any of the back clear lakes,normal Walleye fishing resumes.Jig and minnow 8-13ft.P.S be careful out there,the lake is full of rock piles.I'm sure the owners will help you out with that."
2002145,v-bay gord,2013-08-02 20:09:00,3168,He's going to Wabigoon Lake........and asking about advice about Wabigoon Lake. He's staying at Bonny Bay camp ...on Wabigoon Lake. How does Lac Suel figure into this scenario????
2009537,Skywagon,2013-08-06 07:00:00,1106,"Gord, Sorry, I should have been more clear to the reasoning on that post. My thought was that since he was so close to a great lake (Lac Seul), it might be fun for him to try it out. If Wabigoon does not pan out, he has experience on another lake he might want to try in the future, Eagle lake is certainly another good option. Hopefully Michaelp will post the results of his trip."
2010473,2746,2013-08-06 13:50:00,3206,??? Sounds complicated but.....I get confused easily.
2011201,Guest,2013-08-06 18:22:00,0,"I'm with Robert on the fishing on Wabigoon, I'm sure the camps are all awesome up there. I love fishing on Wabigoon and the other lakes Mile/Trap/Butler, I haven't been Dinorwic other then the first time I fished Dryden Walleye Masters about 9yrs ago. This year during tournament we kinda forced to fish the Wab because we had a nice walleye in the live well that was caught on jig/leech in Butler at 9am, she was lookin a little stressed about 1pm so we decided to leave Butler to get closer to the arena if we should decide to go weigh her. We got out to Wab and she perked tight up so we decided to pitched jigs to some 8ft humps. Next year I'm going get to know Wabigoon better, the fish seem to be fatter. Wabigoon for sure is one of my favorite lakes to fish, the action can be incredible, weed fishing is awesome in Mile/Trap...just drop a jig/leech right into the weeds and wait for the big hit....Just an awesome fishery."
1440341,Limeyangler,2012-05-24 21:14:00,563,Dont know if you will see this reply if you are leaving tonight...anyway...i use a jig and minnow...and sometimes a floating jig/sinker rig with minnow as bait. Slip bobber is also killer!
1444109,pikeandtina,2012-06-03 05:42:00,145,"Robert, Can't wait to hear the report on your trip to Bonny Bay! Eighteen days and counting til we leave..."
1446365,Robert Cardenas,2012-06-07 19:46:00,138,"Well this year was a success again as usual. We caught tons of Jumbo perch and walleye including many big Pike. I posted a video on my facebook page and many pictures on Bonny Bay Resorts website. The video should also be coming to the Bonny Bay site at some point. We did manage to also catch a few of those huge 13-15"" crappies. The weather started out cold but became beautiful the rest of the week. The hospitality at Bonny Bay Resort as usual was spectacular, Len and Nancy go above and beyond to help with every need, including there camp help (Tweet, George, Dusty, Katie, Jamie-SR. dock boy and all the other dock boys.) Our group had a great time and ate a lot of fish and chips. Unfortunately I had some motor issues and drove around Canada for a day and a half trying to get it fixed. But I did get to fish out of the resort boats with the 50's on them and they are really nice, not sure I will bring my boat up there, might just fish out of them. I also got to fish with my 11 year old nephew, it was his first time to Canada and one I think he will remember forever (He caught the 40"" Northern Pike). Oh yea, the walleye bite off the dock is still there! Here are some pics from this year. Good Luck to everyone heading too Bonny Bay Camp on Lake Wabigoon!"
1446686,BWLCwalleyeguy,2012-06-08 13:26:00,26,"Wow, looks like an awesome haul! We left Sioux Lookout Tuesday AM a day early because of snow flurries and 4 consecutive days of subpar fishing. I heard the weather turned around wednesday(may 30th), and it looks like the fishing turned as well. Good job!"
1446775,Robert Cardenas,2012-06-08 18:46:00,138,"BWLC walleyeguy, I probably passed you on the road as I went to the Souix Lookout to the Marine dealer in town on tuesday, I spent a good part of that day there working on the boat. Sorry to hear fishing wasn't to good, Wabigoon stayed hot all week even though it was cold outside, and with the nice warm cabins and Huge Lodge at Bonny Bay Camp we were happy campers."
1446874,Skywagon,2012-06-09 05:56:00,1106,......and the commercial goes on............
1446883,pikeandtina,2012-06-09 06:40:00,145,"Robert, I sent you a pm."
1447115,Robert Cardenas,2012-06-09 23:35:00,138,"Pikeandtina,I don't think I got your P.M. I did get the p.m. about help in Lorrain OH. for the AIM derby I will be fishing. Hope everything is all good!"
1447135,Jeepman,2012-06-10 05:28:00,386,"O'Sullivan's Rainbow Resort, Nakina, Ontario...have any WC readers been fishing that lake over the years. This is our group of 8 first time to fish that lake, and we'll be fishing the mid-summer (early August) bite after years of fishing other Ontario lakes during the mid-June bite. What can we expect fishing O'Sullivan's in Nakina, Ontario in early August as to the fish bite? Jeepman"
1447156,stillangling,2012-06-10 07:11:00,149,I'm with you Skywagon. How about a moderator jumping in an shutting this string down?
1435816,BWLCwalleyeguy,2012-05-15 14:48:00,26,"We fish out of Sioux Lookout, mainly the Abrams/Minnitaki area, but your crappie catching has me curious. I didnt realize there were crappies as far north as Dryden. Do you know how much further north they are caught? Was wondering if there would be a smaller body of water we could fish not far from Sioux Lookout that would have crappies in it. Just curious? Also, do you find large numbers of fish or is the population fairly small and scattered? Very interesting to me..."
1436583,Robert Cardenas,2012-05-16 21:29:00,138,"Not sure BWLCwalleyeguy, I would of never thought they would be north of Rainy, but they seem to be doing great in Wabigoon. I just started hearing of people catching them 5 or 6 years ago, but the pictures I saw of the crappies were big ones, so they have been established for a while on the Goon! I wonder why or how they were introduced to Lake Wabigoon?"
1436750,BWLCwalleyeguy,2012-05-17 08:26:00,26,"Thanks for the reply Robert. I've seen and heard of some locals up there not wanting crappies in their lake, but I'm happy their territory is moving north. Something about watching a slip bobber with minnow go under in a bed of reeds and knowing their could be a fat 15"" crappie on the other end gets my blood flowing. I leave for Sioux Lookout in one week, cant come fast enough!"
1437500,Robert Cardenas,2012-05-18 21:52:00,138,"BWLCwalleyeguy,Good luck up at the Sioux Lookout, I leave in just over a week for Bonny Bay. Have a safe trip and good fishing to you."
1437527,dogrodder,2012-05-19 04:26:00,400,....and opening morning has finally arrived. Rained overnight. Wind is 10 out of the west calling for rain today and a high of 27. Ice has been out for over a month and the wather is warm. This place may fish more like mid June today. BB is fantastic as ever.
1437717,Robert Cardenas,2012-05-19 18:34:00,138,"Dogrodder,That is great news, should be able to use everything in the tackle box to catch fish. I bet those pike will be snappin. Good Luck up there and stay safe, tell Len and Nancy I will see them next Sunday. I will be looking for some of these Gators!"
1439701,Robert Cardenas,2012-05-23 19:39:00,138,"Does anyone know the water temp on the Goon. Heading up this weekend, hope everyone is catching. Lets see some pictures!"
1439715,Limeyangler,2012-05-23 20:09:00,563,"Surface temps are into the 60's now Rob......I have been fishing from in front of the house since opener and they are in as little as 18"" of water.A couple from the lawn last week Rob.http://i907.photobucket.com/albums/a...r/IMG_1980.jpghttp://i907.photobucket.com/albums/a...r/IMG_1976.jpghttp://i907.photobucket.com/albums/a...-Copy-Copy.jpg"
1439765,Limeyangler,2012-05-23 21:40:00,563,oooops double post
1439950,BWLCwalleyeguy,2012-05-24 08:56:00,26,"Nice pictures Limey, shore fishing is always a bonus. I leave for Sioux Lookout tonight, looks like the weather is going to be crap for the next 5 days, but oh well! We have similar water off our dock and have caught walleyes this early in the year before in the shallows(it stays about 3-4 ft for 100 meters before dropping off), but just curious what you use in that shallow of water? I've had great success with a 4"" swimbait. Good luck to you as well Robert, lets hope this forecast of high 40's, rain, and east winds doesn't happen."
1431808,thundereyes,2012-05-07 08:46:00,12,"Hey RobWould appreciate any info you could leave for us, seems to change a little every year. Just put some clues on a note and tell Nancy to give it to the Bensons when she gives me my welcome hug!!!! Have a great trip"
1432086,Robert Cardenas,2012-05-07 16:42:00,138,"ThundereyesI will give it to Nancy as I get my good bye hug. No problem, I hope your crew has a great time and stay safe."
1432093,Robert Cardenas,2012-05-07 17:02:00,138,"Limeyangler & 115 optimaxIf you know Len and Nancy, there is always an open invitation to fish in my boat! Looking forward to meeting you eh."
1432201,Limeyangler,2012-05-07 20:13:00,563,"Sounds like a plan.....like i said...get online once you arrive and shout me up...if i aint workin i will come fishing, guaranteed!"
1432379,Robert Cardenas,2012-05-08 07:35:00,138,Sounds good Limeyangler.
1434071,dogrodder,2012-05-11 10:18:00,400,Planning on heading out onto Wabigoon opening morning. Hope the walleyes are hungry!
1434281,Robert Cardenas,2012-05-11 19:18:00,138,"Dogrodder, it would be nice if you posted a couple pictures. Good luck on Wabigoon and stay safe. I wish I was there!Here is some picture memories from last year!"
1434363,115 optimax,2012-05-12 04:37:00,650,"If you don't do good on the Goon,hit the back lakes.Butler,Mile and Trap.I've been Crappie fishing a few times on Mile last week and we have been getting lots of nice Walleye mixed in with them."
1434695,eye1a,2012-05-13 08:45:00,9,"Hey Robert Cindy and I wont be making out yearly spring trip to the goon, and it sucks. We are the Couple from Nebraska. Will miss the nightly campfires and good compnay of the camp. Not to mention the camp supper. I remember that great stringer of perch your group brought in last year. We are thinking about booking a fall trip if we can afford it. Have you ever fished there in the fall? Have a great trip and drive safe............Dan"
1435105,Robert Cardenas,2012-05-14 09:31:00,138,"Dan,Yea, the latest I have been to Bonny Bay is in late August, a couple of years ago I was up there for a week. We did just as well as we do in the spring, if not better. Our group is going to miss ya. Hope you can make it up and good fishing to you and your wife this year, and stay safe."
1429039,Robert Cardenas,2012-05-01 00:35:00,138,"Can't stop thinking about my first Canada trip of the year, to Bonny Bay Resort. The end of May is going to be here soon. Len and Nancy better get that firewood stock piled for the camp fires every evening, along with the peeps. The walleye and perch fish fries, along with the double fried french fries will be here soon. Looking forward to spending some time with the family! Anyone else heading to Canada in May? What are some of the favorites you look forward to at your resort you go to?"
1429756,Babamel2,2012-05-02 12:52:00,414,it seems like wc does not attract many peoplie who fish Wabigoon/Dinorwic. Do hope you have good finding some hot spots.
1430099,Robert Cardenas,2012-05-03 07:54:00,138,"I have been going to Lake Wabigoon for a long time. There are too many Hot Spots. The walleye and jumbo perch bite is crazy. Also the pike average size is in the upper 30 inch range, which is a hefty fish, with muskies mixed in. 24 days until I'm at Bonny Bay Resort, but who's counting? Almost forgot about camp dinner, and perogies!"
1430134,115 optimax,2012-05-03 08:38:00,650,"Wabigoon is an awesome lake to fish!Tons of rock piles to fish.Most common problem for people out there is fishing too deep.I've been fishing the Gooner for 18 years now,and most of my 6-8 pound walleye came out of 3ft of water or less."
1430153,thundereyes,2012-05-03 09:11:00,12,"Hey RobertHeading to Bonny Bay 1st week in june, the only thing you forgot to mention was the campfire smores. Len and Nancy run a great camp.Hope for some decent weather and great fishing."
1430852,Robert Cardenas,2012-05-04 20:28:00,138,"Thundereyes, Looks like I will miss you by one week! Look for the pictures on the trophy board in the Lodge, I will try and leave some clues to where some of the fish are. One other thing I forgot is fishing off the dock at night with lighted bobbers and catching walleyes."
1430982,Limeyangler,2012-05-05 08:20:00,563,"Have a great time Rob.I live on the Goon within sight of the Twin Towers. Met Nancy the other day and she recognized my voice from some videos i post. We chatted fishing of course and your name came up too, said i was familiar with you for posting here. SMALL WORLD these days.Anyhoo, never know...might just crash into you at Devils Island! Or if ya fancy a shot at some crappie this end of the lake shout me up on here.CheersSimon"
1431705,Robert Cardenas,2012-05-06 23:26:00,138,"Limeyangler,That would be great, I will be helping my teammate out at the Can-Am AIM walleye tournament in Brimley MI. but will be heading up to Bonny Bay Resort Sunday the 27th.
