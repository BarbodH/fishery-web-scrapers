Fortunately, that's the extent of the bad news as the fishing was as good as other years...probably aided by the windy, cloudy conditions. We(my son and me) fish exclusively for walleyes with mostly jig and twister tail tipped with a nightcrawler. We'll fish some with Hot N' Tots to locate, then jig. Surprisingly (at least to me) was the depth in which we caught the majority of the fish. The number one depth for the week was 4-6 feet as the wind was howling across reefs and points and wind beaten shorelines. Also got into some fish as deep as 15 feet coming off a mid-lake reef. For the numbers folks we counted fish on our last day and boated 110 walleyes. Most days were similar in numbers with a few days a bit better and a few a little slower. The cabins at Ara are some of the nicer ones we've stayed at with good propane stoves and fridges and a large solar panel supplying electricity....assuming the sun is shining. Outhouses serve the cabins as does a central shower house with pretty good hot water. Several guys in camp were on the meal plan and were pleased with the quality/quantity of food. The boats and motors were solid and ran well. I believe this camp/lake provides an excellent value. One exciting moment on the return trip: As we approached the border my son was driving and asked for the passports. When I handed them to him he asked why I had ""Mom's "" passport. I assumed he was joking but, unfortunately, he wasn't. A few exaggerated heartbeats as we explained the situation to the border guard but he was very cool and we returned with no problem. He actually joked that my wife and I kinda look alike! Looking back it was interesting that the customs agent on the way in to Canada didn't notice the passport error....or figured we were too dumb to be any trouble and just didn't bother."
