Had 2-3 days of good fishing other days had to work hard for them. Fished McKenzie Bay, Bay of Islands, South Inlet, & South of Manitoba Point. Walleye are deep 25 - 35 feet. Best fishing South of Manitoba Point. Used jigs & Willow & Tommy Harris Spider Spinners with minnows with good results. Fair results with Leeches & Crawlers. People also had good results with bottom bouncers. Saw 2 Moose & a black bear. In our 10 years of fishing Lac Suel this was the most difficult & challenging trip.....fish weren't in the typical hot spots. Still had fun & planning our return trip next year!!!! RBF."
