1999530,TrollerDude,2013-08-01 19:06:00,33,We are heading up to Minaki on 8-9-13. This will be our first time in this area. Was wondering how far of a boat ride is it up to Big Sand? Is Big Sand the best area to fish out of the surrounding lakes? Are there any hazards to look out for on the water? Any info would be great! Looking forward to going to this area!!!

2000577,yurtman,2013-08-02 09:07:00,46,"14 minutes flat out from the Rockpile to the bridge with my 620! wouldn't recommend it if you don't know the water.permanent hazards are well marked but fluctuating water can hide some others - get a map and follow the main routes until you are familiar with the area. if it is a new area - slow down, especially around the islands and points.Jack's baits in town has everything you need. leeches or crawlers always work but not necessarily both at the same time. be prepared to try different presentations in different depths. when the fishing is ""hot"" it almost doesn't matter but other times it still requires some skill."

2003898,LoDo,2013-08-03 21:18:00,721,I remember trolling spoons and rapalas in 80ft of water in big sand with 20 other boats in the middle of the night years ago. All boats had the front and rear lights and fished under the northern lights. Incredible fishing and even a better atmosphere. Heaven! Several boats followed one another single file back to Paradise Cove at 1am ish... Such a great memory. Suspended walleyes in 25ft plus of water. Have fun!
