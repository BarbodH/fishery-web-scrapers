2004193,captwatk,2013-08-04 07:10:00,7,"I'm leaving Friday for my 3 trip in 3 years to Lac Hebert. In 2011, 2 of us drove a Lexus 330 SUV. At and overe over 50 mph you had to be careful especially on freshly graded, thick gravel. We went into a 4 wheel drift once, but recovered nicely. In 2012, we took a Toyota RAV4, with stability control, and handling was better - no problems at 50 mph. This year there are 4 of us in the RAV4 with a roof rack. With such a heavy load, speeds will have to be lower."

2007553,trapperbob,2013-08-05 14:00:00,45,I just returned from Clova over the weekend. The road from parent to Clova was in great shape. However the road from St. Michel to parent was in terrible shape with extreme wash boarding in several areas. You can still make it in a car but the road to Parent will really slow you down. It may be regraded by the time you go.
1980306,NY Walleye,2013-07-25 09:00:00,78,"Just returned from Lac Hebert in Quebec last night. Weather was not good but fishing was fantastic. Three days out of the five days produced heavy rain and big winds. My father and 7 year old where on the trip with me. 7 years olds do not like three to four foot ways. Fished when we could around the rain and wind. Caught hundreds and hundreds of walleyes in the southern and middle of the lake. Most where between 15 and 19. Caught multiple eyes 20-22"" which were all put back to the lake. Caught a 27 in eye which ran around 8 pounds that was the biggest of the week. My son caught close to 50 plus eyes in a three hour stretch right before dark. Needless to say he did not want to go home. Roads and travel went very well with a 10 hour return trip to Syracuse. Air Tamarac was fantastic and camps were well equipped and taken care of. Thanks to Ron, Steve and Barry for all the advice. These guys really know this lake. We will be returning very shortly. Father is 65 plus years hung and been fishing his whole life. Never seen fishing this good."
1980562,octanehi5,2013-07-25 10:32:00,1104,"glad to be of any help, Lac Hebert has always been a great fishery, Air Tamarac,Is and has very good locations on the Gouin and Hebert, One of the best if not the best outfitter in Quebec, A better fishing trip in Quebec can not be found, For the money it can not be matched, anywere in Canada.All of our guys had the trip of their lifes, setting their personal bests very high.The bite this late in the yr was very good,because of the late winter,and lack of high water temps. The guys who went early in june did not do as well as normal, Great to hear all the positive reports on the lac"
1981985,trapperbob,2013-07-25 19:17:00,45,Glad to hear you had a great trip. We are on our way up tomorrow for a week of fishing. It will be our first time.
1999394,wantabigone,2013-08-01 18:22:00,39,How bad is the dirt road drive? Can one do this in a car. No one in our group has a truck!
1999442,NY Walleye,2013-08-01 18:40:00,78,I think you Could travel the road in a car or SUV. Took us 3.5 hours from MT Lauier to clova. Road was graded with a few washboard spots. They were grading when we left. I drove a Ford Escape and traveled at 45 to 55 MPH. No issues. The fishing is so good it's worth the trip.

2000153,rsiminski,2013-08-02 05:41:00,53,I would not hesitate to make the drive to Clova in a car. I went up there last month and the roads were in great shape. We have always drove a truck or large SUV but a car would have no problem.
2000257,octanehi5,2013-08-02 06:41:00,1104,"You will have no problem making it by car,The first section of road from st Micheals to Parent is a little rougher than the streach from Parent to Clova, we moved along at 55mph at times. plan on being on a dirt road for 3 1/2 hrs. you are not going to do it in 2 hrs. The only problem I would see is how much gear you can bring in a car?"
2000385,TheDFP,2013-08-02 08:02:00,39,"We did the drive in a Toyota Highlander back in mid June. The Highlander is built on a Camry chasis. We had no problem and when I had a truck, we never needed 4WD. Made the drive in about 3.5 hours."
2000673,octanehi5,2013-08-02 09:44:00,1104,"I understand that some of the roads that go off of the clova road are a real hoot, like getting to the Gouin by car, is a trip you may not want to take. Thats why when you are that far north its time to fly in."
