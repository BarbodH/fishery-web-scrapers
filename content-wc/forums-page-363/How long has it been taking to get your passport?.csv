2005609,troutwater,2013-08-04 19:41:00,299,Just wondering how long its been taking to get your passport or passport card lately. My g/f sent in her application last month and we were wondering. I got mine 5 years ago so I don't remember.
2005713,Glenman12,2013-08-04 20:34:00,762,IIRC I got mine in 6 weeks..the birth certificate came a few days later..
2006025,kzoofisher,2013-08-05 03:52:00,5144,"6 weeks for me, too. We applied back during spring break in March and I have to say the folks at the Post Office did a great job with a big crowd. Made sure that everyone in line had their paperwork in order and took people who needed pictures in for those so there wouldn't be a delay at the front of the line. Kudos to them."
2006313,troutwater,2013-08-05 07:07:00,299,"Thanks. I applied for mine in like January in a year when the requirement got extended by a year. My brother made fun of me for it since I ""wasted my money."" Well the next year he put it off and had to expedite it...costing more than what I had to pay. I found it amusing."

2007681,dogrodder,2013-08-05 14:39:00,400,My fishing partner sent his expedited form in on July 27th. Anybody want to take bets on whether or not it will be here by the 9th of August?
