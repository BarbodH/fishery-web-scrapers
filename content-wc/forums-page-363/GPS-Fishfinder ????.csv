I thought about using thje 597 ci-HD-DI that I have on my boat. But by the time I buy a transducer, a base mount and a power cord I will have spent $200 or a little more. All I really want is GPS and 640 pixels. If I can get a good new or used unit for under $300 I would just as soon get a second unit. Is thera a unit any of you would suggest that would fit what Im looking for?? I found a HB 768 Combo on ebay but the reviews are really mixed."
