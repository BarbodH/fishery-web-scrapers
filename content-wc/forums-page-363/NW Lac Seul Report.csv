2009849,Anglin Andy,2013-08-06 08:52:00,100,"Fished July 29, 30, 31 and August 1 in the Manitoba Point area. 3 guys, 3 1/2 days of fishing, Great trip. We caught 38, 70, 76 and 109 walleyes during that time. Numerous fronts coming through made it interesting at times. Used bottom bouncers and spinners usually in 24 to 29 feet of water. The bite was not aggressive as you would feel ""extra weight"" or a very ""tiny tick"". If in doubt treat it as a fish. The final day we did not move from our area and I would say we fished primarily a 100 yd stretch of structure, of the 109, 70 percent were 18 inches or bigger. For the trip we had a 1-28, 2-27, 4-26, 6-25 and as I stated many fish between 18 and 22. We had excellent accommodations staying at Gayley's Little Beaver with Gayle and Doug being excellent hosts.
