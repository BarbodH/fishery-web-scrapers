2005481,go dart,2013-08-04 18:16:00,77,I should of thought of Charlie but I didn't know he guided Lac Seul. I've know him for 3 years and he's a good guide. Showed me places on Perrault I never fished in 10 years. Definatly hire him.

2004593,SinOrSwim,2013-08-04 10:14:00,1528,"We will be fishing out of Onaway Lodge Sept 7th through the 10th and are looking for a guide a couple days. If others in our group are interested, it could be a full 4 days? Anyway, we did ask Kathy at Onaway if it was okay to ask and bring an outside guide in. They are also putting some feelers out to see if they can hook us up. If anybody is interested or knows a guide in the area for early September, please let us know. This is only our 3rd year fishing Lac Seul. We have done okay, but not great and would love to get to know the lake a little better from someone more experienced. Thanks!"
2004689,houndog,2013-08-04 11:25:00,365,I've heard several stories about problems at the border for US guides taking folks fishing in Canada. You should check out the legal aspects if you are thinking you will hire a guide and his boat from here in the US.
2004697,rather-be-fishin,2013-08-04 11:31:00,429,Doesn't Onaway have a guide? I have gone to 3 different resorts on LS and they all had a guide from the resort that we used. It is definitely a good idea & great way to learn the lake & the fishing hot spots. Good luck. Let us know what you find out. RBF
2004713,SinOrSwim,2013-08-04 11:40:00,1528,"I am not looking to take someone with from the U.S. to Canada to be a guide. I'm looking for a Guide that guides out of that area. A local.Also, yes they normally have guides from my understanding but not sure if that time of year is different? They are going to try and line one up for us as well but she said it was okay if we tried as well.Thanks"
2004737,go dart,2013-08-04 11:58:00,77,He's not a guide but Limey on this board is money on Lac Seul. Mabe he could offer a spot.
2005177,rommel,2013-08-04 15:32:00,369,i just returned from onaway on Friday. Blair told me that they don't have a guide working in camp at this time. he did put us on fish right away though.nice place and great people.
2005257,Hawkfan,2013-08-04 16:01:00,237,"You have a report?!? Like Sin said, we leave in 4 and a half weeks. Getting that itch!"
2005297,rommel,2013-08-04 16:23:00,369,"we had a very tough bite. cold front first day. had a couple high wind days and thunderstorms on our last day. we caught fish in bay of islands, McKenzie bay also produced( moose island, big sands, and almost any island in the bay). caught most fish in 18-24 fow on jigs with minnows and spinners with minnows. also took a trip to broad and sunlight. we caught a lot of fish in these two lakes but they tended to be on the smaller side. big fish was 27 1/2 caught in bay of islands. many in the 20""-26"" range and also a lot of smaller eyes . hard to catch good eater size fish. good luck up there."
