532168,Guest,2003-06-11 08:01:00,0,"Walleye Pirate...........sorry for all the dissing, some of these knotheads just can't help themselves. I completely understand your request and wouldn't hesitate to shoot a stupid rodent if I had to. Things aren't always as cut and dry as they seem up in Ontario. A couple years ago I had a bear break into my cabin and he kept coming back for no other reason than to tear other things up around the camp. I called the local MNR and they told me to shoot the ####....which I did with a gun I brought across the boarder about fifteen years ago when the gun laws were sane up there. Take the BB gun and don't sweat it, just tell them you have it when your crossing the boarder."
532170,troutaholic,2003-06-11 08:08:00,827,"I agree with Aaron....besides, stewed squirrel is a good meal to have after a Gazillion meals of walleyes - especially one that is fattened up with cookies!!! Oops, I better not say walleye meals...someone will get angry that we are ""depleting"" the resource. Jusr Rip Lips and Keep a Tight Line!!"
532220,Guest,2003-06-12 05:19:00,0,"Spiced just right a good gumbo with walleye and squirrel is fit for the gods. That squirrel fattened up on cookies is perfect. Reed the little guy peanut butter cookies for a day or two before the cooking, makes for a nice flavour"
532229,Guest,2003-06-12 09:12:00,0,Are all Canadians this self-righteous? Try giving the guy some help rather than being so arrogant and condescending. Your best bet is to contact the border where you will be crossing and ask them the protocol.
532232,Guest,2003-06-12 09:45:00,0,"Since it seems you have offended some of the holier-than-thou crowd, I suggest you take a live trap with you to catch the helpless little squirrel alive. Then put a big treble hook in his butt and use him to troll for muskies."
532249,Guest,2003-06-12 13:26:00,0,"Welcome to WC! You obviously have not spent much time on this message board. Unfortunately, the responses you got were what I have found to be all to common here. Do a search of previous posts on ""Beer in Boat"" (be sure to search the archive) if you really want to get a taste of what goes on here. It really is quite humorous!"
532261,Guest,2003-06-12 16:15:00,0,"Please don't bring a BB gun across because it is the official weapon issued to Canadian Armed Forces. The Army mounts theirs over the handle bars of an armored mountain bike, the Navy has their birch bark canoes bristling with BB guns and the Air Force has their radio controlled planes equiped with rapid firing BB guns AND they can drop firecrackers if it is real battle."
532262,Guest,2003-06-12 16:24:00,0,"The post wasn't about some flea bag varmit, it's about a firearm. Due to Canadina gov. firearm regulations I would suggest leaving the weapon at home to avoid potental problems and bring up a walkman or gameboy instead, or better yet get him on the eye's asap and he won't even think about being board."
532283,Guest,2003-06-13 04:58:00,0,"You are so right ""ask a simple question---get a major lecture."" I do agree that a BB gun would probably be a hassle at the border. I would suggest bringing a Wrist Rocket sling shot and some glass marbles. Those things are great fun (if I remember correctly from 35 years ago). The camp vermin would be history in short order. The boys could toss a stick in the water and shoot pebbles at it, set up a paper target, put a can on a stump, etc. I figure that I will get a lecture now that Canada has strict ""Sling Shot Control Laws""."
532288,Guest,2003-06-13 06:33:00,0,"BB gun = firearm? That's stretching the definition past the point that my dictionary describes. I don't argue Canada's right to restrict or probably soon ban firearms, but if it's supposedly a safety issue, I'll guarantee there's more people killed every year with knives than BB guns. Better start checking the border for knives too. Personally, I'd rather have my kid outside practicing target shooting with his BB gun than playing with a Game Boy. I just don't hear myself saying ""Okay, son, we're going to Canada to spend a week in the woods fishing and learning about nature and enjoying the outdoors. Don't forget your game boy."""
532146,Walleye Pirate,2003-06-10 18:32:00,2,I'm taking a group of dads and sons into canada and one of the boys asked about bringing his bb gun. Anybody know the border regs. about this? Thanks
532148,Trailerguy,2003-06-10 19:40:00,1407,"In Canada pellet guns with more than 625 fps. are registered, just like a firearm. Your typical Red Rider(spring operated) falls below this so it isn't regulated. Alot of pump-up BB guns fall in the regulated group. I can't imagine any camp owner that would be happy to see a BB gun in camp though."
532149,Guest,2003-06-10 20:01:00,0,"Your kidding me right? Whats the kid going to shoot? Birds or what? I can bet you a plug nickle that targets get pretty boring after about 15mins of shooting as I went thru the same thing when I was a kid. Guns in Canada are nothing like guns in the u.s. , You make sure you declare that innocent pellet gun your going to bring across the border and lets see what your car looks like after the B.P. go thru it with a fine tooth comb and after they do a through check of all your i'ds. We have laws concerning guns here in Canada and there is no ""right to bear arms"" here. Leave the gun at home, your there for fishing not for target practice."
532152,Walleye Pirate,2003-06-10 20:23:00,2,"Didn't expect a debate over gun rights, or child rearing, just looking for information, which I believe is what this board is all about. By the way, the camp we go to every year has a resident squirrel that has decided any and all cookies brought into camp are his property and the screen windows wont stop him either. Our hosts not only have to pay for the repairs this rodent creates, but have gone so far as to offer a t-shirt bounty to the last young man I brought up there. Not every kid shoots out windows and kills songbirds. Hunting and firearm respect is taught thru father and son relationships on trips just like this, be it fishing, hunting, or just quality time together. Lighten up guys....I dont think the ruin of civilization hinges on a kid with a bb gun."

532154,Guest,2003-06-10 20:38:00,0,You can't kill anything in Canada without a liscense not alone a squirrel. They are protected under the small game laws of the provence of Ontario which for them would be legally open either the third or fourth week of September depending on which zone you wish to hunt. Sounds to me that your camp owner is trying to skirt the laws of Ontario by having you kill the pest instead of applying to the MNR for a permit to harvest this animal which BTW would leave you liable for your own actions. You can't kill Fox Squirrel or reds with a gun here period unless you have a liscense to trap which you being a non-resident is impossible. Like the post above said leave the gun at home no matter how innocent you may see it to believe as others may see it in a totally different manner.
532159,Guest,2003-06-10 22:30:00,0,"Sure, bring it...and then I hope Canada Customs throws your sorry arses in jail. Please, someone, give this guy the ""Buffoon of the Month"" award."
532160,Guest,2003-06-10 23:00:00,0,"This may be a dumb question but in the fall, when many US citizens go to Canada to hunt, what do you do then? Don't they bring their guns then? I haven't hunted in years and never have in Canada."
532162,Guest,2003-06-11 06:53:00,0,"Sure, you can bring non-restricted firearms into Canada for hunting but you need to fill out a firearms import permit before hand for approval."
532163,Trailerguy,2003-06-11 07:04:00,1407,"Hunting in NWO is certianly not as easy as it used to be for USA citzens. You need to pay a $50 fee at the border to get your long gun in. Or take a course and get a Purchase and Aquasision License, $80 good for 5 years. Then register the fire arm, $25 now I beleive. You need an old hunting license from your state, or take their hunter safety course to buy a small game license $75. Then hunt in the correct Wild Life Management Unit, at the correct time. That would be just to hunt a rabbit or Grouse. Now if you want to hunt bear or moose....... ;) ;) you better rob a bank first. LOL"
