You won't see it when reading this message, just back up and look at the top of the page for View in Threaded Mode. You'll have the same look and feel as the old one. When you want to see the main message and the replies then just click on the View All link right behind the main message subject. I also run a dcforum that is not a PHP version. Trust me this board will make everyones life easier in the end. The old version requires a lot more to maintain and even administrators want to go fishing once in a while. Thanks Walleye Central"
