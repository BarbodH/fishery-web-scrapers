532284,Guest,2003-06-13 05:08:00,0,Stu-Take a good look at Holinshead Lake Resort. It is located 2 hours north of Thunder Bay. Absolutely the most beautiful lake I've been on and the fishing is out of this world. Website is www.virtualnorth.com/holinshead. George and Sherri are super great hosts and really down to earth. You can e-mail me at [email protected] if you would like any further info.
532049,Stu,2003-06-07 14:28:00,472,Does any one know of a secluded lodge in Ontaio?I would prefer a drive in. I don't want to seem rude but I am trying to get away from the crowds. A friend suggested crow lake but it seems a little close to LOTW. I am trying to set up a trip for next June. Any suggestions?

532079,Guest,2003-06-09 07:25:00,0,Take a look at our website - buenavistaresort.com
532081,Guest,2003-06-09 07:51:00,0,"No particuliar resort to recommend. If your willing to drive, I suggest lodges from Ear Falls and north to Red Lake. Look for one resort on a lake or a fairly large lake system. I used to say the way to good fishing was over bad roads or have a big pocketbook. You may want to look at boat-in resorts. The operators often will pick you up and take you to the resort. Boat ins won't have the cost of a fly-in but usually will get you away from personal watercraft and water skiers. One of my best fishing trips was to a boat in resort in the north arm of the north end of Rainy Lake near Devils Cascade-great smallmouth fishing."
532123,Ia Walihntr,2003-06-10 10:59:00,320,"Spruce Island Camp! On LOTW approx in middle of lake. Boat launch from Morson or navigate yourself. (It's easy with map or GPS coorinates) Excellent accomodations and very helpfull owners. You'll see very few boats from other resorts. (only one close) Most importantly, the fishing in that area is great for all spiecies. Website is: www.spruceislandcamp.com"

Check out www.witchbay.com Yes, it's a lodge on LOW....but a secluded one. There are recent posts on the Gabbin' with Gail page about how pleased people are with the service. FWIW..... Lunker"

532215,cough6609,2003-06-11 23:56:00,48,"I'd say the most important question is ""what species of fish gets you going""? If it's walleye and northern...I'd agree with a previous post, go north of Ear Falls or Sioux Lookout. Going up the Pickle Lake road will definitely get you into some secluded areas. Pashkokogan Lake is about 2-3 hours north of Sioux Lookout and there were times we would not see another boat for hours at a stretch. If you're pulling a boat with you...it can be an adventure...keep both hands on the steering wheels! Unless you want to spend the $ on a fly-in, any resort up the Pickle Lake road will give you the seclusion you're looking for."
532264,Stu,2003-06-12 16:57:00,472,"Actually guys, I have no problem w/ LOTW. I'm just looking for a small to medium sized lake. I am trying to stay away from a fly in because of the weight limits (boat in would be fine). I would also consider Manitoba if you know of any there - Thanks Stu"
