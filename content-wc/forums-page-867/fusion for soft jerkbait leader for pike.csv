532266,Guest,2003-06-12 17:56:00,0,Was wondering if anyone has tried using spiderwire fusion as a leader as opposed to wire? It is pretty tough stuff which is hard to cut with a knife/scissors. I was considering using it with soft plastic jerkbaits when I go to L.S. next Saturday. Would appreciate any input. Thanks in advance!
532271,Guest,2003-06-12 20:08:00,0,Not sure about Fusion but I have used Fireline in various diameters and the pike have no problem cutting through it. I think I should just keep a pike in the tackel box for when I need to cut that line. They work better than a scissors!
