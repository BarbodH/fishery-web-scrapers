532237,Stevie B,2003-06-12 10:09:00,157,When are you headed up that way? I will be in that area this weekend. I heard that the fishing was great in the clearwater area. I try and find out more and let you know how it was. Fish ON!!
532238,Guest,2003-06-12 10:22:00,0,I hae a cabin there...but I'm a trout/musky fisherman and haven't a clue about walleye in the area.
532246,Stevie B,2003-06-12 12:01:00,157,That is about what 75% of my fishing is. Hopefully I can get into them and see what there biting on. Last year at this time nothing else but leeches where working. And in the middle of summer nightcrawlers where the way to go. Most of the time we where jigging of points and reefs or trolling walleye spinners. We also do a fair amount of small mouth fishing as well. For those we usaually go for top water early in the moring or tossing buzz baits along shallow rocky shore lines. Fish ON!!
