Since he thinks he's the BASS MASTER trying to perfect walleye fishing. I'll show him next week the biggest walleye living in lac seul. Since the POLISH MASTER is my teacher he guarantees that we will once again see J.R. puff up."
531569,Ryan,2003-05-31 10:11:00,135,"Been there probably 6 times from between mid july and early august. Caught several 28.5 inchers, but nothing larger. We have also landed a few muskies, and some nice northern up 45 inches. Stayed in the Chamberlain Narrows region. Always catch some big walleye in wapesi, but on average, we catch our big fish of the the trip headed south past bear narrows and near the big water."
531570,Guest,2003-05-31 12:15:00,0,I've been going to Lac Seul for 11 years...I caught a 30.25 inch walleye my very first year there...since then I haven't been able to top it. Hopefully I can break that record later this year.
531571,Guest,2003-05-31 16:17:00,0,"Aye, One Leg our mission is the JR puff up. Its almost to easy....but it is so much fun to watch those carotid arteries swell up and that big nose turn RED."
532197,Guest,2003-06-11 16:58:00,0,"Been fishing Lac Seul for 31 years- About 6 years ago took a houseboat up to the NE end on the Opening Saturday- cold temps and intermittent snow all week. A group of 6 of us locked on to a sand bar /drop off with current. We all caught personal bests - post spawn females : 1-35"" , 3- 33"" , 4-32"" , lots of 29"" ...you get the idea- these were all released after the photos were made. We had to travel 7 miles each direction to two river ""falls"" in order to pick up fish small enough to keep/eat. We don't go that 3rd Sat. in May anymore as the ice still on the main portion of the lake has blocked our route on several occasions. We have never again got into fish of that consistent size during the warmer months- The fish caught in the warmer months ( never fished it in the fall), have never exceeded 30"" , although not as long, are in great shape- strong,fat and much more aggressive! We catch the biggest ones trolling Muskie baits in the deeper narrows areas. Great fishery - although we have collectively lost 2 lower units, 2 props and a powerhead over the years while we were still learning the lake . Sometimes those insurance premiums come in handy!! best regards, JBP"
532222,Guest,2003-06-12 06:33:00,0,"Well, last year was my first year up there, and my biggest was 28.5"". My father has made over 25 trips, and the largest was about 34"" or so. Usually, they catch several in the 28""-30"" range. Last year, the temp was warmer than usual (second week in July), so that may account for the drop off in size, as the mayfly hatch had already happened (we only caught a handful of 28+""). This year, with the 'delayed' spring, I'm hoping for much better!"
531558,Guest,2003-05-26 16:06:00,0,Seems like a lot of you guys fish Lac Seul. What is the biggest Walleye you personally have caught on Lac Seul??
531559,LUCKWI,2003-05-26 16:59:00,13,Weve been going to Lac seul for at least 15 years and every year we have several over 28 inches.My personal largest is 29 inches.We have fished for years in the Vaughn lake areaRoy
531560,Guest,2003-05-26 19:24:00,0,been fishing Lac Seul for 5 yrs now almost every day my personal biggest was 26 in... still trying to beat it;)
531561,Mike KS,2003-05-27 05:41:00,18,"Been on Lac Seul for 10 years . Biggest Walleye 31.5"". Even thiugh it was caught by a friend it was a beauty."
531562,Codydawg,2003-05-27 07:34:00,14,"Been fishing both walleyes and northerns on Lac Seul for 17 years. I mention that as I fish walleyes about half the time. Personal biggest is 29.5 inches, however, I couldnt hope to count the ones over 26 inches. Probably average easily over a 15 per year. Just about every year, I hit the 28 mark. My biggest fish usually hit cranks."
531563,whitetip1,2003-05-27 09:03:00,53,"Been there once. Biggest was 28"".Dave"
531565,Guest,2003-05-27 09:42:00,0,"My biggest was 30"" about four years ago."
531566,Guest,2003-05-27 10:19:00,0,"4 years in row now, 29"" every year but one. Leaving in 8 days. Perhaps this is the year to hit 30"" but if not, a week in God's country, at a terrific resort, and with my father and my son, what could be better?It's not what you accomplish, but how you accompish it"
531564,Guest,2003-05-28 06:29:00,0,"I am part owner of the Fly-in camp on Vaughan Lake( at the end). The biggest Walleye I have seen caught ( by my partner was 31"" ) in fall. In spring the walleye are everywhere and the fall the numbers drop a little but tend to be much bigger. I am going there the first week of July. When to you normally go?"
531567,Guest,2003-05-28 09:44:00,0,Im not a very good fisherman . The biggest Walleye I ever got was one I dipped with a dip net when my buddy the POLISH MASTER caught it. I put it on my stringer and it got away....Im Stoopid
