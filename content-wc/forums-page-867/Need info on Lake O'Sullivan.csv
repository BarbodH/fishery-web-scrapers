532143,Guest,2003-06-10 16:35:00,0,"15.5 pounds, that must be a good story--we're up on 6/12 through 6/21 and we'd love to know about the sandbars. North or south of the lodge? We've always used worms and jigs, or rigs, are leeches really effective, more so than worms? Thanks for the info and yes, we always follow the wind. have a great trip."

532185,Guest,2003-06-11 13:05:00,0,"Hi Andy If you have been a patron in the past than you most likly have heard of teds bay (former owner) this has some wonderfull sand bars near the mouth of the river and along the shore about 20 feet from the shoreline.. again the wind should be in the direction of the river, in order to be productive.. also in the center of the bay there is a small rising of rocks (takes time to find) this has been proven to be a great spot to catch dinner.. you must first determine the pattern in which the fish are in.. if they are in post spawn I recommend spending some time in this area the 15 pounder was caught near the lodge sandbars close to the entrance to pikes bay.. I have determined this area to be some kind of highway for the fish to move about and follow the baitfish on which they feed.. also if you pay attention to the sandbar on which you dock your boat you will find an occasional leech, therfore proving that large fish who have in the past fed in this area, may be on the lookout for a tasty leech snack (matching the local forage can produce the best fishing under the right conditions) smiths bay is a good morning spot if the fish are known to be in shallow waters.. good luck keep me posted ps i was in the brocure in 1999 bob fiorito"
532219,Guest,2003-06-12 04:51:00,0,"Andy This O'Sullivan is so loaded with walleye that it's tough to pinpoint specific spots, depending on conditions. Each year, it seems, we locate hot fishing areas that, the year before, might have been not so productive. There are areas that would produce for us, big time, for a year or two and would be less productive the following year. As a result, we spend a lot of time trolling around and trying new areas and re-trying the old favorites. One trip I would strongly suggest is up the river to Clatouche. It's shallower and warms up a bit faster. The water color is a bit greener and the bonus is that HUGE pike swim this lake. Smith's Bay can be outstanding for trolling and jigging (near the entrance and all along the surrounding shorelines) and, when the wind is right, off the island at the far end. Raymond's Bay and all of the bays on the same side of the lake on your way to the south end have been big producers at various times over the years with the mouth of Candy being exceptional, at times. If the wind is right and the weeds are up, big pike lay in the shallows and will hit anything that moves. Be stealthy and toss weedless spoons or buzz-baits back into the river and out through the upgrowth before working the open water for walleye. The sand bar at the north end (to the left, as you come on to the main lake, past the big island) is sometimes unbelievable when conditions are right. West, Southwest or South wind, threatening skies and a jig dressed with a twister with a crawler has produced. But trolling or casting sticks will get 'em, too. I could go on forever, but I think you get the point. Have a good trip and save some for us, eh."
531948,Guest,2003-06-03 20:00:00,0,Anybody been to O'Sullivan yet this year? What's new or old or whatever? Many Thanks. Cannot wait to get there.
531949,5Paulie4,2003-06-06 02:38:00,34,Andy...the fishing at O'Sullivan must be so hot they decided not to come back. Or the road's so bad they can't come back. It's 21 days and counting for our group. Good luck.Thunderstick
531950,Guest,2003-06-06 18:38:00,0,"Thunderstick - Looks like we are on the same schedule. We are scheduled into O'Sullivan on June 27. Do you recommend buying bait (leeches) before going into the lodge? This is our first Canadian fishing trip and we are really looking forward to it. See you there.Dennis S.Long Valley, New Jersey(Water temperature 56 degrees at Round Valley Reservoir this morning)"
531952,GR8WTHUNTER,2003-06-06 19:36:00,618,I fished it mid June last year. Did good at the north end of the lake.
531951,5Paulie4,2003-06-07 05:08:00,34,"You can pick up leeches at the gas station in Maniwaki. It's on the left side of the road as you head out of town, adjacent to a Subway and it's open 24 hours. We've only used leeches sparingly over the years and pretty much stuck to 'crawlers, which are available in Maniwaki (and, unlike leeches, available at the lodge as well). We pass by the 1000 Islands Bait Shop on our way through, so we'll stock up on worms before crossing the border. Since it's your first trip to O'Sullivan, feel free to look us up and we'll be happy to share some information. This stretch of cool weather should mean that the black flies could be active and also that the walleye might still be scattered in shallower water, so we'll start by trolling small Rapala floaters (#3 and #5, orange, gold and, of course, old style Thundersticks). We'll be arriving around noon on Saturday, June 28. Just ask Russell to direct you to the four guys from Batavia, NY Have a good trip and enjoy that drive up the Clova Road! Thunderstick"
531953,Mr Ranger,2003-06-07 06:17:00,272,"Our group of four will also be up on the 28th and are all from Wausau, WI. One of our members has been up many times and we are relying on his experience. He usually went up the first part of June and is concerned we won't catch anything during the end of June. We are confident this won't be an issue as only the pattern should change. We also have heard that crawlers are a very good bet. Will let you know how we make out.Stay safe!"
531954,Guest,2003-06-07 13:24:00,0,Whats the price on 300 crawlers at Manawaki or the Thousand Islands?
532074,Guest,2003-06-09 03:40:00,0,As of 6/8/03 the prices for Crawlers at the 1000 Islands Bait Shop are as follows: 100.....$12 250.....$25 500.....$45 You can check out their website for up to date info at:http://tibait.com Good luck!
532098,Guest,2003-06-09 18:21:00,0,"We are heading up for our trip the week of the 20th. Have not been there in five years but we have had great success in the past.. Avid walleye fisherman I have taken some pretty nice fish, largest caught was 15.5 pounds back in 1998.. recomend trolling the sand bars in the evening near large wind blown points with drop-offs using lindy rigs and leeches or air blown crawlers. boat controll is crucial.. if you find a school try slip bobbers and leeches. jigging can be effective near rocky points.. use ultra light line and the lightest jig possible to reach the bottom white color in the evening chartuse during the day.. pike can be caught on thundersticks.. key is to follow the wind hope this helps...... bob"
532128,Guest,2003-06-10 11:47:00,0,"rrobertbubbles, can you identify any specific sand bar areas? i have fished o'sully but still have alot to learn. any input would be helpful. thx."
