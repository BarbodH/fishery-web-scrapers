Luckily we were within the law both time. With regard the game warden tried to explain the change in the limits on walleye to the 2 and 2 rule of LOTW. 2 in the boat per license maximum and 2 back at the resort. making your limit of 4 in posession. The game warden was very nice and believe that had we had more than authorized might have let us put one back from the live well. It was nice how referred to us as "" our friends from the US"". But he said something about the reason for the 2 and 2 rule was because of the govenor of minnesota jesse ventura and something to do with fish. I should have asked him to further explain why something jesse ventura did would penalize the americans onfishing on LOTWs. Does anyone have any idea what this could be about? thanks alan"

A few years ago some owners on the American side were taking launches over to the Canadian side and limiting out, then going back to their American lodges. I think the non-resident limit was 4/day at the time. The Canadian govt. responded with some type of restriction aimed at Americans who weren't staying overnight in Canada (somebody will correct me if I wrong about this). The American govt. responded by complaining that the new restriction violated NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement). The end result was that the lower limits for non-residents stayed in place, but instead of applying only to Americans who just come over for the day, now it also applies to Americans who come up and spend a week at a Canadian lodge. In my humble opinion, two walleye per day is enough anyway."
532247,retire55,2003-06-12 13:14:00,1029,"Some non-residents not accommodated in Ontario were harvesting more walleye than Ontario residents legally could from ""Border Waters"" (e.g. walleye limits in Minnesota were higher). In response, Ontario changed the catch and retain walleye limit in Border Waters for non residents not accomodated in Ontario to zero (in other words catch and release only). As Rockpt stated, there was a NAFTA challenge to that Ontario response. Subsequently, Ontario changed its catch and retain limits in Border Waters for all non residents, regardless where accomodated, to 2 per day. I suggest that you not consider this as punitive against non residents. Rather, see it as a postive response that Ontario took to better manage walleye resources in Ontario waters. Surely, you must support such measures or you wouldn't be going to Ontario to fish. Resident Ontario fishermen can catch and retain 4 walleyes per day in LOTW unless they have walleye in their possession (possession limit is four walleye). Consequently, a resident who catches and retains 4 walleyes on the first day of his fishing trip can not legally catch and retain any more walleye that day or any other day unless he somehow reduces the number of walleye in his possession. A non resident has the same possession limit of 4 walleyes. It would appear that any claim that non residents are being penalized is a non-starter."
532253,mps,2003-06-12 14:17:00,7,I am from Minnesota and I think that the Canadian limits are fair and I am glad they are looking out for their fishery. I agree that no one needs to keep more than 2 per person. Now they just need to do something about the fish hogs on the MN side of the lake.

532278,Guest,2003-06-13 00:02:00,0,We used to go to lac saul for the previous 20 years and thought we would try LOTW to see how it is. This is where we always went when we were kids. I guess the road to lac saul back then was just gravel. Its not a big problem just not we were used to. Just was curious as to the limit reason. The resort owner just said the rules are the same as last year. i guess it was my mistake not to ask exactly what the limits are.
532282,ackermannsacre,2003-06-13 03:48:00,196,"Seems it is not a mistake but a responsibility to read and understand the rules and regulations for any body of water each year as the regulations come out. The boundry water special regulations for non-residents have been in effect since 1999. For someone that states he has been going to resorts in Canada since you where a kid, you don't seem to be too savvy about traveling and accomodations in general."
