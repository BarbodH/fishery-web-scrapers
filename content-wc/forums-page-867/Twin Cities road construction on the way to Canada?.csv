532182,Guest,2003-06-11 12:25:00,0,"If you are going north on I-35, get off at 33 North thru Cloquet and it will hook you up with 53 just north of Deluth. Don't have to go thru the city then. Nice short cut as 33 only goes between I-35 and Route 53."
532183,Guest,2003-06-11 12:35:00,0,"When I came back from Lac Seul 2 weeks ago there was not any construction on 35E. For years I took 35W, now I take 35E. I would recommend 35E, if you get into the center lane you only have to change lanes once. Also a lot less traffic."
532186,Guest,2003-06-11 13:07:00,0,If you are going thru during the week in mid-afternoon you best have alot of time and patience. There is construction everywhere here your best bet is to come thru very early or very late.
532189,Trailerguy,2003-06-11 13:54:00,1407,[font size=4][font color=green][b] But is 35E better than 35W?
532192,gmerz,2003-06-11 14:19:00,911,"Not right now... I drive 35E twice daily from northern suburbs to southern suburbs and recently switched to 35W. The construction on 35E at Roselawn is a real bottleneck... Only through mid July, then I'll be back to 35E"

You may want to try detouring via the 494-694 loop. Take 35E to 494West. 494 turns into 694 as it crosses over I94. About 15 miles later you'll see the I35E North exit. On 494, you'll run into a botleneck over the Mississippi River. Stay in the right lane until your most way down the hill, then try to get left. - Rick PS, Not So New is right about going thru Cloquet instead of Duluth if your heading through International Falls / Ft. Frances."
