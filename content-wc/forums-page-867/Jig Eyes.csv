I usually make double eyes by using those paint sticks you can buy in a craft store. One touch with the end of the pen in black or white, then when it dries I follow up with another eye inside the first spot with the opposite color. On bare, livebait rigs I don't know if it makes much difference, I think the main color is the big thing. I usually make about half and half. Only once can I recall where I thought eyes made things worse and that was real clear water. I've had exceptional experience with two tone jigs in contrasting colors. But I still make a lot of single color jigs. If I had to chose no eyes or eyes---I'd go with the eyes."

I do put them on the hair jigs I tie for sale because people seem to expect them. I do not put them on plain jig heads, I have had very few people inquire about them on the untied heads-go figure."
