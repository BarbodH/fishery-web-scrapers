532156,Guest,2003-06-10 22:07:00,0,"I can give you a couple of places to try as I have fished Wabigoon/Dinorwik Lakes a fair amount(8-10 times) but not for the last couple of years. On Wabigoon, fish Devil's Island especially if there is some good wind. Our group has done much better in morning than the evening at this island. There will be alot of boats fishing around it. I would also spend some time back in 1 of the smaller lakes connected to Wabigoon & Dinorwik called Butler Lake especially around some of the small islands as there are alot of quality fish in Butler. If you get a good South or West wind I would fish the windy sides of the islands on Dinorwik. Buy a good lake map to get you started. We jig fished these lakes with 1/8 & 1/4 ounce jigs in primarily white, chartreuse, & orange colors. Sometimes we just used a colored jig head & a crawler or leech or we added a 3"" twister tail. We never used minnows. Good twister tail colors are white, chartreuse, & yellow. Don't be afraid to fish shallow for the eyes in these lakes as the water is stained. Wabigoon & Dinorwik are large lakes & you really have an opportunity for numbers of fish along with a chance for a 10 pound walleye. Good luck & let us know how you do. DC"
