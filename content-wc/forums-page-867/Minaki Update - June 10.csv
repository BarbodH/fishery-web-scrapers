I was out a week & half ago and noticed that the water temp in the river was around the 60 - 62f which tells me that we were all fishing wrong. I suggested to Don to head on up to the lake & sure enough.....the fish were there. I'd say that the fish are in a early summer pattern right now. IF you are heading up, go up to Big Sand. Don was doing very good on the big sand beach. Mike H. also did well on the Clay Banks, with a 31"" taken from there. The fish have been in the ""staging"" area for the crank bite, so that may even get going soon. I'm currently in Winnipeg, so I don't have any reports from the last couple of days. I'll be heading back in a couple of hours. I've yet to hook up with any new W.C guys & gals, but Reels is out there right now , and there are others as well. Later this week is a scheduled W.C shorelunch, I don't know exactly when/where but I will next post after this ""event"" :-) Good Fishen Robwww.minakilodge.com"

I love the updates because I'm not able to go up their this year because of a new born child. Rob have you ever flew out of Haley's and what did you think if you did?"
532204,Guest,2003-06-11 18:44:00,0,"Yes, it's Mike H. from Brainerd Minn. Spoke to a couple of guys today & they were hammering them. These guys headed home today & were claiming that this year was the best fishing they have had in 6 years. Lots of reports of big fish 28 - 32 with a ton of fish in the 25 - 28 range. crawlers was working best for these guys. It would appear that all the past efforts of catch & release are finally starting to show. Good Fishen Rob"

532230,BillyBigFish,2003-06-12 09:33:00,31,Where were the fish caught. I am heading up Monday for a week and I really could use a good trip. Thanks
532241,Guest,2003-06-12 10:36:00,0,"Most of the bigger / nicer fish have been coming off of Big Sand. The Sand beach has been good as well as Clay Banks. West Harbour has also been producing real sweet ! I'll be out guiding Sunday / Monday so I will have a much better idea as to what / where etc. BillyB.F come see me sometime monday evening, and I'll give you the lowdown. I can be found around the lodge here, when you see the sign out front ""Dockside - bar & grill"" thats where you'll want to dock and look for me. Just ask around, everybody here knows who I am...... Good Fishen Rob"
