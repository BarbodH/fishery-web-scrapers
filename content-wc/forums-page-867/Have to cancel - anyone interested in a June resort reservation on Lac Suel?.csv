Here are the details: the reservation is for Sunday June 22(afternoon) through Saturday June 28(morning check out but can fish til noon or so). Cabin can take 6 but was booked for 2. I saw several posts in the Spring looking for June spots on Lac Suel. So maybe this will be a good opportunity. I just want to get my deposit back however it works out. Post your email or let me know you are interested and I will contact you immediatelly - we need to move fast."

532150,Guest,2003-06-10 20:07:00,0,Give me $300/US and i'll pay the rest. Let me know if interested as I hear the fishing is good up that way!
532165,Guest,2003-06-11 07:21:00,0,Sorry Fear Factor - that's not an appealling offer. I walk away and loose my deposit already. It doesn't make much sense to pay you for my spot. Let me know if you are still interested.

532174,Guest,2003-06-11 09:36:00,0,I would hope they would hold my deposit for next year. I just thought someone might be looking for a shot at a June week on Lac Suel. It's a long shot kinda deal and can understand if some are hesitant. We will contact the resort tomorrow if there are no interested parties...to give them a shot a filling the week.
532239,Guest,2003-06-12 10:29:00,0,ttt - one last shot - will cancel tonight if no one is interested
532242,Guest,2003-06-12 10:55:00,0,"Fuzzy, You said the cabin sleeps 6 and it is reserved for 2, is there a minimum number of people? What is the cost for the week?"
