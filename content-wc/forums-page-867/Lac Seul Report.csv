Weather was very mild and not the best for Walleye fishing....high sunshine, no clouds and calm to light winds. That said, we still boated extremely high numbers of Walleye. We didn't seem to catch the number of fish over the slot that we did last year, but still lots of action. Biggest walleye of the trip was 27 inches and several northern in the slot with the biggest being 39 inches. Stayed at Anderson's lodge and again, great service and accomodations. These folks really go out of there way to help ensure you have a great vacation. Good luck to all....I'm back to reality until next trip!"
532129,Guest,2003-06-10 11:49:00,0,Just returned from Lac seul also the other day and have to say that we caught more fish over the slot this year. And we thought we killed the walleyes last year. We had a hard time catching fish to eat. Everything was slot or bigger. It got to the point where it was annoying to catch 25-27 inchers all day. Smally fishing was UNBELIEVABLE!!!! Hundreds in the 3-4.5lbs range. Spent one day just fishing for them and absolutely killed them all day
532130,Guest,2003-06-10 12:05:00,0,Hey just wondering how you fished for the smallies???
532132,Guest,2003-06-10 12:44:00,0,"Hey Walleyeman, Where were you staying on Lac Seul and how deep of water were you catching all those smallmouth ?"
532176,Guest,2003-06-11 10:05:00,0,Walleye were caught anywhere from 3.5 to 12 feet of water. Most were in the 7-8 feet range. Smallies were caught VERY shallow (104 feet)off of range piles. Sluggo's bass assassins ect worked really good. Shallow running cranks worked even better. Pop'r's worked really good. spinnerbaits never got hot though.
532177,Guest,2003-06-11 10:06:00,0,"thats 1 to 4 feet on the smallies, not 104"
532258,Guest,2003-06-12 16:01:00,0,"Hey MOFisherman....are you the guy from Lebanon we bump into each year at Andersons? We're the guys in the bus, a couple highway patrolmen, and go into an outpost with Anderson's. I believe we were pulling out the same time you and your wife were leaving. If I'm right, email me at: [email protected] Thanks...eyesnatcher"
