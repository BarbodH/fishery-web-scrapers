532216,Guest,2003-06-12 00:05:00,0,"has anyone else noticed the attempt or so it seems that when checking out the bill is never right. It almost seems that they are hoping that when you check out in the morning you will be in too much of a hurry to look it over real good. mistakes seem to be the rule rather than the exception. Our place tried to charge 119 dollors for 2 7 day nonresident licenses that we bought in town at the bait shop for the listed price of around 30 each. the gst tax was still included because he said the government never finished the process , so now we have to send in the form for the refund. gas at he dock was 95 cents a liter canadian. 90.00 dock fee for our boat. Does anywhere in canada charge for using the boat launch? $5.00 at sioux narrows. All the public water launch ramps we pass in canada on the way look free to me! just want to compare others findings.. thanks alan:("
532218,Guest,2003-06-12 04:20:00,0,"Sounds like you picked the wrong lodge. In my 20-some years experience fishing in Canada we have occasionally caught billing mistakes in our favor but never had any incidence of over charging. In fact, it was the camp owner who enlightened us about the GST rebate and walked us through the procedure of processing our refund to our full advantage. Cheating customers is suicide to ethical operators. If you have evidence that your operator is raking you, it's time to move on or settle up the night before your departure when you're not in such a hurry."
532223,retire55,2003-06-12 07:34:00,1029,"ex pup: If you ended up with surprises (e.g. docking fee, price of gas at the dock, etc), you didn't ask all the right questions before you signed on. Deductive reasoning (i.e. ""has anyone else noticed the attempt or so it seems"" and ""mistakes seem to be the rule rather than the exception"") to paint every outfitter with the same brush went out with the dark ages. No one condones unethical or cheating outfitters. And it's fine to ask questions for clarification. However, castigating all outfitters while you're at it isn't acceptable. Our experience with Canadian outfitters has been outstanding."
532224,stumcfar,2003-06-12 08:38:00,451,"The camp we stayed at last year tried to overcharge us upon checkout. I'm not sure if it was an honest mistake or not. They charged my buddies extra this year and as a result they drove down the road to a different resort and booked for next year. We are going back the end of this month, but if we have the same problem again, we also will look elsewhere. Check the bill and if you are not satisfied, there are many other great resorts willing to accomodate you."
532225,Guest,2003-06-12 08:59:00,0,"You haven't lived until your ""all inclusive"" fly-in outfitter charges you extra to rent the ax by the week to split the firewood, or extra for the life preservers for the boat, or $1/day for a landing net, or $4/gal. US for boat fuel, or $5/gal for for coleman fuel for the lanterns, which he also charged for. Live and learn. And this guy is still in business in the Chapleau/Wawa area. They always find another sucker."
532231,Thumper,2003-06-12 09:40:00,133,"Hey, Alan Although many resorts charge a launch fee when you bring your own boat, $90 seems excessive! I think $10/US is pretty average and it usually includes a slip with an outlet for charging your battery overnight. 90 cents a liter for gas at the dock isn't really excessive. However, they should have told you the price before pumping. The GST thing isn't really that much on an inconvenience though, is it? Sure, it'd be nice not to have to pay it at all, but you can get the rebate form off of the internet and you ge a check back in a few weeks. Did they charge you any / the full PST (in Ontario)? If they didn't know about not having to charge the full GST, then they might not know about the PST amnesty this summer. $119 for the licenses? I wonder where they came up with that price? It's ALMOST the cost of 2 Full Year non-resident angler licenses (2 @ $55 ea = $110 + 7% GST = $7.70 = $117.70 CAN) round up to the nearest dollar for $118 - then what, a 1$ service charge for (not) selling you the license? So, what lodge was this? - Rick"
532233,Ia Walihntr,2003-06-12 09:46:00,320,"We have always asked for the bill on the eve preceeding our departure. Over the years, mistakes were made but we always had time to go over the bill before paying it that evening. I'm sure that the mistakes on our bills were ""mistakes"". I gotta believe that a big percentage of all the resort owners would not risk the consequences and possible legal reprecussions that would almost inevitably come from purposely falsifying their customers bill. Have to think it was a mistake."
532235,Ia Walihntr,2003-06-12 09:57:00,320,"Alan Most resorts in the Patricia Region charge between $5 and $10 for using thier boat ramp and between $80 and $120 for weekly dockage, especially if electricity for battery charging is at the dock itself. The easiest way to be sure that all chares are ligit is to have a brochure and a current rate shedule before you go to the resort. The brochure and rate sheet almost always has all current prices and all applicable charges. It helps to have them when you are checking the final bill."
532244,Guest,2003-06-12 11:47:00,0,"Most of the mistakes I've found have been in my favor. I agree with most of the other posts that with very exceptions, the camp owners are ethical and would never intentionally try to screw their guests. Sometimes I leave the owners at my camp an extra $50 or $100 for the ""camp fund."" They never want to accept it, but I tell them to use it for upkeep, bonus for staff, whatever. Because I go to the same camp twice every summer, I kind of look at it as ""my"" summer camp and I'm happy leave a little extra to keep it in good shape."
532279,Guest,2003-06-13 00:17:00,0,the launch fee was for using the public access ramp at sioux narrows. the charge was 5 dollors round trip. It just seems like I dont remember seeing any charge at any other launch ramp in canada. the dock fee was 90 and I knew about that. Yes we went over the bill the night before to avoid the rush and luckily I did look at it and adjustments were made. I think next year we will go to the same area but a different resort.
