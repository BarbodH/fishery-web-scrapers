561258,prov1900,2006-09-19 22:30:00,544,"OK, Just got back on the 17th and had a wonderful trip. The fishing and the weather made it the best trip I have ever had in 38 years. Lots of walleyes and some nice smallies made a great fall bonus. I will definately be headed back to Lac Seul next year. As far as the resort goes......all I got to say is.....""DUDE!!!"" If anyone wants any clarification on that, let me know."
561259,Hump,2006-09-20 07:40:00,578,I wouldn't mind clarification. Did you stay at Golden Fawn? Where did you get into the smallies and any big walleyes?
561276,prov1900,2006-09-20 19:52:00,544,"Well, if youre not expecting 5 star, no make that 1 star accomodations, then it is not bad. The thing that peeved me somewhat was the extremely poor (intoxicated) attitude of the owner. I mean...wow. If you want to feel good about your own alcohol usage, then this is the place for you. I know she has fallen on hard times, but come on. Business is still business. The price was more than fair and the owner was more than fair about some of the extras, i.e., rental boats. They dont know where the fish are and could not care. You are on your own. Now for the good news. The fishing was excellent. We started on the west end and about the third day, made our way across McKenzie Bay, through Poplar Narrows, and beyond. This is where we found our honey hole. A perfect point, with a tapering shelf, with 30 foot of water fairly close. We hit tons of eyes and a handful of nice smallies, plus decent pike, all on that point. Anything went from 5 to 30 foot of water, all day, i.e., app noon to 4:30. It is a long run there though. Lots of gas. Play the wind. If you have a GPS, do yourself a favor and buy the Navionics chip. Well worth the investment. Two of our guys thought they could get by without. They are regretting it now because they both hit rocks. Maybe not 110% accurate, but I was really, really happy with it. By the way, jig and minnow or jig and half crawler was the only thing that worked. I tried some other things, but when I didnt catch a walleye in 5 minutes, went back to the jig and minnow. Any more details??? Holler."

561610,Guest,2006-10-15 05:56:00,0,"> Has there been a buyer for Golden Fawn? NO, the camp hasn't sold. You could always call Barb direct and ask. She will be closing up now that moose hunting is over."
560125,Guest,2006-08-09 01:21:00,0,Hi. sorry to hear about golden fawn. we stayed there many years and it was fine. a couple years ago her husband died and some scoundrel tried to steal it from her. I guess its too much for one person to handle. yes the fishing was always great too.
560212,Guest,2006-08-10 15:28:00,0,Has anyone heard if the place has sold? I think Barb is burnt out.
560213,Guest,2006-08-10 16:00:00,0,"We were at Goldpines the second week of July and Golden Fawn came up in one of the conversations. She had it on the market for 1.25 million. Before the property changed hands and the new owner took over, the indians trashed the place. Whoever took it over has a job on their hands to bring it up to par."
560217,Guest,2006-08-10 16:40:00,0,"Does anyone know the new owners, or did they back out? Any idea when it was trashed?"
560247,Guest,2006-08-11 10:49:00,0,Trashed by Indians!?! News to me! Haven't heard anything about it officially being sold. It's a beautiful spot that needs some TLC!

Etc. >Any info would be appreciated, unless you are going to tell me >it is the worst place in the world:) We are locked in for >September. I know it cant be all bad, a former Iowa girl runs >it!! The camp has NOT been sold. Yes, there were some natives working there but didn't trash it. Barb does have it for sale and it is a beautiful spot that needs some attention."

560464,Guest,2006-08-19 13:10:00,0,I hear someone is very interested in buying. Anyone else heard any thing?
560517,Guest,2006-08-21 12:25:00,0,I knew someone was interested and was coming to look a couple of months ago. I haven't heard anything since then.

559808,Guest,2006-07-28 13:35:00,0,"Our group of 4 stayed there this year. Made a reservation for 2 people was told had room for 6 people in the cabin ""bring up to 6 people to get the cost per person down"". Called back when we had the 2nd two-some confirmed and was told no additional deposit was required. Also told them we would be bringing 2 boats. Low and behold when we arrived we were in a little 1 bedroom cabin! Largest lodging available. Cabins are old, not upkept. Dockhand that was there first day was gone the next (Was told he went back to prison after being out for just 2 days). The deck hand counted every minnow I bought (Buy them at Four Seasons Bait shop, same price but you get about 60% more minnows, trust me I counted every time.) No gas pump at resort, just a 500 gal. tank that you had to fill 5 gallon cans to run to your boat. Only bright side was that you are only 1/4 mile from the logging bridge. We vertically jigged the supports of the bridge and caught 12 walleye from 23-28.5 inches. No little fish there. Good luck at the resort. You'll need it. By the way, the resort is for sale, good luck getting that welcome feeling. My only conversation I had with the owner was listening to her gripe about how lazy her employees were & how much overtime they were ripping her off. Just my 2 cents. Dave"
559809,Guest,2006-07-28 14:50:00,0,It's started to age a bit....needs some cosmetic love. Lac Seul is an amazing lake.....your sure to enjoy some excellent fising.
559816,prov1900,2006-07-28 21:25:00,544,"Well, I dont need five star accomodations, but am disappointed to hear about the quality, or lack thereof. Thanks for the tip on the bait, I will be headed into town for that. Hopefully with my 54 gal. gas tank I can get through the week without several trips to the big tank. No matter what, it will always be better than being at work, right?"

559817,GMANNN,2006-07-28 22:35:00,8,From where your at you can trailer up and get gas in town without too much hassle. We were at Timberlane and they ran out of gas so we had to load up and go to town to get gas. Did it and had the boat back in the water in ~40 min. We fished Mckenzie bay every day so the 200 Merc drank gas!

559824,prov1900,2006-07-28 23:14:00,544,"I hear ya, got a 225 Optimax myself. I miss my 135 on my old boat with gas prices the way they are. Plus, I think we will be making lots of runs to Mac Bay, but I am looking forward to it, regardless of the cost. I assume gas in town is cheaper than the resort. I hope I can get through most of the week on what I have in the tank coming across the border."
559828,Guest,2006-07-29 07:03:00,0,You could always boat over to Gold Pines camp for gas. They were charging 1.21 when it was 1.23 in town. Gold Pines is also a nice place to stay with some bigger cabins and very close to the same area.
559830,Guest,2006-07-29 08:16:00,0,Definitely boat over to Goldpines and get your gas. Peter and Christa and Bill and Helen will be more than happy to help you out. Just came bacj from 2 weeks over there. You just have to get on the waiting list for a cabin.
