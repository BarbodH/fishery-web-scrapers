561605,Mr. Walleye,2006-10-14 11:02:00,74,"Hi Bugsy I haven't stayed at Windsor, but have stayed at 3 of Ryan's other camps. We're going to Blackbirch Lake for the second time this June. Ryan & Kathy run a first class operation. I'm sure Windsor is similar to where we've stayed. Nothing fancy, yet clean, modern accomodations and equipment with FANTASTIC fishing. If you want info on Blackbirch, Dearden, and/or Obashi, let me know. I KNOW you'd love these lakes. These 3 lakes have the kind of fishing you dream about. Been going with Northern Ouptosts for about 7 years. Went to many places the previous 15 that weren't even close to what they offer. It's not cheap, but you get what you pay for. Hope this helps."

561612,bugsy,2006-10-15 07:35:00,49,"Thanks Mr. Walleye, Glad to hear you're so pleased with the Grady's. Still hope to get a little lake info-maybe from Larry S. or someone else- on Windsor, but can you tell me this? Did you stay at one of Ryan & Kathy's overnite cabins or a motel the night before & which would you recommend? Bugsy."
561615,Mr. Walleye,2006-10-15 20:16:00,74,"We've stayed at both. Prefer Ryan & Kathy's. Less hassle the morning you fly out, and price is at least as good."
561620,jigman 2003,2006-10-16 07:58:00,981,"I haven't gone with Ryan yet (will this year thanks to Mr. Walleye), but I can tell you that the McKenzie Lake Inn (local motel) is clean, comfortable, and the owners are friendly. Wouldn't worry about staying with them. It's less than 5 minutes to Northern Outposts from the hotel."
561621,Larry S,2006-10-16 08:53:00,666,"Bugsy, Went to Windsor Lake June 16th to 24th last year. E-mail me your phone number at [email protected] and will give you info on the lake. My report is also listed on Windsor from last year on this website Larry S"
