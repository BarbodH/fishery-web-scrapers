561380,Guest,2006-09-25 18:53:00,0,Voyaguer. Where do you stay? Rodneys? We make the trip a couple times a year and stay right at the marina. Good fishing! I haven't found anything other than the mapcreate topo that shows any detail in that area.
561383,voyaguer,2006-09-26 08:35:00,54,"Highwayman I usually go to Separation Lake. I just got back last Saturday. Fishing was good as a large front came thru which cooled things off quite a bit and the bite was on. Looks to be even cooler this week. Looks like fire ban is over now due to rain. And I guess we just have to rely on Map Create Canada for the time being. On a side note, my new Lowrance 334i was a huge disappointment. Would not recommend that. It is a good idea that should work but does not and from what i have heard from others on this site and more, it has not performed well in many cases take care V"
561534,Guest,2006-10-05 15:59:00,0,"Does it also show reefs, depths etc. Like the chip for Lake Erie?"
561553,180FH,2006-10-06 14:05:00,444,"along the route line these hazzards are noted, and other prominent features in the system away from the route are also highlighted...such as large reefs and humps, etc. and depth increments. It is not unlike any other Navionics map for a smaller lake visual wise...although I am sure that not all the hazzaeds in the lake are marked, but they are along the route line and high traffic areas. I had never ran it till this year and had no problem, 30mi. in and 30 back. Bottom line is it's worth the money."
560528,180FH,2006-08-21 20:56:00,444,"Just returned and used this chip on my 3500C....was VERY impressed. Came out of Lost Lake landing and ran as far as Bear nrws with NO problems just following the route lines....all major navigational hazzards ALONG THESE ROUTES are marked; truly a thing of beauty. Might add that I also nailed a 47""er that was easily over 30lbs."
560531,7thCrowWing,2006-08-21 22:41:00,132,"We are using camp boats but I have my 334c rigged portable to use the chip /gps, glad to hear it works well!! Headed up sept. 8th to Evergreen."
560624,voyaguer,2006-08-24 12:52:00,54,"180 or 7th Crow. could you tell me does the chip you are using go down the English River towards the confluence with the Winnipeg River, and if so, all or which parts ?? Is the product labeled as your message reads ""Lac Seul Premium Chip ?? I have asked Navionics repeatedly and received a multitude of varying answers, but none definitive. Thanks in advance"
560629,Sutsgold,2006-08-24 14:36:00,219,"Voyageur, try navionics web site. They should have all the waterways listed. The chip for lac seul is the Navionics HotMaps Premium Canada. I got mine through the cabelas website. Best of luck."
560630,180FH,2006-08-24 17:11:00,444,"voyaguer, the product is the Navionics Premium Canada chip. As for the confluence question I don't know. The chip opens up as you travel and you really don't want to be zoomed out too far. If you fish Canada there are other lakes on this chip also; and chances are what you want might be on there also, so the chip seems like a good deal either way. I agree with Sutsgold, go to> Navionics Inc. 6 Thatcher Lane Wareham, MA 02571 508-291-6000 800-848-5896 fax: 508-291-6006www.navionics.com[email protected][email protected] hope this helps"
560640,voyaguer,2006-08-25 12:17:00,54,"Thanks to both of you. My ignorance on these chips is obviously showing. I thought they might be like the Map Create chips and others where all you need to in put it into your GPS and scroll to various locations, then zoom in to see what they show. My guess is they will show some but not all of the area i am interested in. I have contacted Navionics several times, but the folks on the phone or web site will just reference the list of lakes they show, which I know from experience are not complete. I guess I thought they could just pop the chip into a gps and scroll to where i was looking and tell me, but as i said, I guess I dont understand enough about how these work in the first place. I am wary to buy the chip only to find out it doesn't cover the area i want as their ""credit"" return policy only covers part of the initial cost. anyway, thanks again and take care"
560649,Guest,2006-08-25 19:06:00,0,"Voyaguer, you aren't as ignorant as your giving yourself credit for!! Your are correct, this chip can be put into a gps unit and zoomed in to look at a specific area in order to see the detail. Do you know anyone who has the new premium Canada chip that you could get a look at? If not, I would be willing to take a look at mine and see if I can locate the specific area you are talking about. I just back from fom Lac Seul a couple weeks ago, the detail for Lac Seul is excellent."
560665,voyaguer,2006-08-26 13:24:00,54,"Hello MuskyMark The English river flows out of the westerly end of Lac Suel and heads west and a little south. Like most of the major rivers in this area, it is comprised of a chain of lakes for the most part. The area I am interested in is about mid way from where the English converges with the Winnipeg River. Generally, that would be between Ear Falls and just north of Minaki, downstream from the White Dog Dam. The lakes i am interested in should show up fairly easily as they are significant enough to show in general shape and name on the standard background maps from Garmin and others. They are: Grassy Narrows Ball Separation Umpreyville Lount there are a few others in this vicinity as well. Map Create Canada shows these lakes well, but of course no bathymetric information. I know that one of the chips works for the area north of Minaki around Rough Rock\White Dog Dam because i have seen this chip in action. I just don't know how far that chip goes east, and I am a long ways from the owner of that chip right now. Unfortunately, I dont know of anyone closeby who has these chips to look at and i tried with Navionics, Cabelas, Bass Pro, Sheel Sports etc. and they dont seem to have the capacity or interest in looking. There ought to be an easier way to find this out, but thanks in advance for any assistance you can provide."
560687,Guest,2006-08-28 10:18:00,0,"Voyaguer, I spent some time scanning over my navionics chip for the area you referenced. Sorry to say, it does not appear there is any data for these lakes as best I can tell. For what its worth, you can go the navionics website there is a place on the website where it asks ""don't see your favorite lake?"" and you can make recommendations for lakes you would like to see added. Good luck & good fishing!!"
560708,voyaguer,2006-08-28 22:03:00,54,Thanks MM I really appreciate that you took the time to do that. Now I know I just rely on my Map Canada Maps for now and hope that Navionics picks up my area in the future. I did leave them a message earlier this year on that matter. take care
