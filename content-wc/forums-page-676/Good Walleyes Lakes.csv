I have been going back there for almost three decades. The chain of lakes and bays is 35 miles from one end to another. I have always stayed at Jim and Julies Wabaskang camp, but there are other nice camps on the lake. I think there is 6 camps total on the lake. If you want more information drop me an e-mail at [email protected] Brent"
