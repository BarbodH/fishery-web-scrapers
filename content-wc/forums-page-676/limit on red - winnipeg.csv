561616,Canuck eh,2006-10-15 21:07:00,5,"There is NO limit on the Red River at Lockport, that is if U follow the C & R system. If U are planning on keeping fish that is another story. The daily limit is the same as possession limit no matter if U have a ""Conservation"" license or full license the numbers are 4, with a combination of walleyes and saugers. Slot size: U can keep one a day over 22"" and if U plan on keeping one over 28"" (why U would though) U have to sign your license. You are allowed only one per year over 28"". This year there are lots over 22"" and several over 28"" with a fair number in the 30 to 34"" mark. ps: I took it for granted U were asking about walleye, was I right?"
