561561,Guest,2006-10-09 09:16:00,0,"With ThanksGiving upon us I am just wondering what it is you have to be thankful for? I personally am thankful for all the support my family has gave me over the past year, That everyone I care about is in good health and doing well. That I got to spend more time on the water this year compared to last year. Gerritt."

561569,tlars,2006-10-09 17:21:00,137,"What do I have to be thankful for? Wow - where to start: the perfect wife for 37 years; 3 happily married daughters; 3 grandkinds with 3 more on the way; sons-in-law who like to fish & golf; a job I love to go to every day; free of prostate cancer since Feb 14, 2006 (aptly named the Valentine's Day Massacre by the poker group); two trips to Lac Seul every year; and most of all way more blessings by the Grace of God than any one man should deserve. Life is indeed good. Lars"

561577,Dacotah Eye,2006-10-10 11:43:00,2722,"The support my family has given me since March 1st. I have had eye surgery, two heart surgeries and three weeks ago surgery for Prostate cancer. My wife and son have been great. I bought a new boat this spring and only managed to get 22 hours on it this year. Hopefully they removed all of the cancer and I will be thankful for a much better year next year. Good luck to ya all in the future. :cheers:"
