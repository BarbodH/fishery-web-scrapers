This morning I spoke with a guy who hales from Grand Forks and the success he has enjoyed over the past five days is nothing short of mind blowing!! So far his trophy tally has been ""ELEVEN"", his two largest both exceeded fourteen pounds! I think it's fare to say that few other if ""any"" other trophy walleye fisheries can produce like the Red when she's on! Where else can one guy catch eleven HAWG's of that caliber in five days. The sweet part for this individual........he still has a couple of days left before he has to head south! Oh ya, one last important item that I have to mention. This walleye catching machine from Grand Forks, ND has released each and everyone of these massive fish....way to go buddy!"
