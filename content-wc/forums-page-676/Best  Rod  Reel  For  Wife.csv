Talk it up on how you are not worthy of it............but she is. she will use it when she needs to, once a year, and you will have to use it, I mean, take care of it when she does not. worked for me with the treestand, muskie rig, bass boat(i mean fish and ski boat). Has not worked with the chick from hooters yet though."

561515,Guest,2006-10-04 11:04:00,0,"My wife put a new fishing pole on her Xmas list. We are going to Ontario next June to go Walleye fishing and she would like to have a new outfit. I was thinking of getting her a 6'6"" Med pole with a light spinning reel. St Croix PS66MF Quantum Kinetic-PTi-A 8.6oz Does anybody have any other suggestions that maybe their wife fishs with? This set up will be used for jig fishing. Thanks, Kevin"
561517,uzzi,2006-10-04 11:52:00,349,"My wife likes using a 6'6"" Berkley Series One (med or med/lt action)with a Quantum Catalyst PTI-20 reel, 6lb line for jigging, she likes the setup, light, sensitive rod, and a great reel."
561523,Stauff,2006-10-04 14:11:00,110,"I took my wife to BPS for her birthday at HER REQUEST. She came away with a Shakespeare Ugly Stik Lite 6' 6"" with a Shimano Symetre 2500 reel. She wanted the durability of the Ugly Stik and really fell in love with the Symetre compared to her old Garcias."
561527,Guest,2006-10-04 18:40:00,0,"I've had the girlfriend on a 6' St. Croix with a shimano Symetre 2500 for a few years now. She likes it and does well, sometimes too well! Your wife will benefit greatly from a St. Croix or some other upper-end rod with good sensitivity, especially for walleye. NWO Fishing Bum"
561529,Guest,2006-10-05 00:36:00,0,"i dont know if its good for the sife or not beins im not married, but i just got a rod and real from BPS for $150. the rod is a walleye angler signature series 80 million modulous graphite 1 piece(99.99). the real is a bps enticer(49.99). both very nice havent had the chance to fight, or feel a greenback bit on it yet, but used it perch fishing a few weeks ago and felt nice there(way to heavy but very sensitive). i know both are available on line. hope you can find her what shes looking for as long as she doesnt out fish you now."
561542,jerry bark,2006-10-05 19:03:00,822,"that outfit will be great, i fish almost the exact same. cheers jerry"
561545,Crappie Kid,2006-10-06 08:46:00,1581,Get her whatever you think would be your dream outfit. That way she is happy and you have a nice backup rod when fishing without her.
561550,Liquid Metal,2006-10-06 12:28:00,245,"I had always let my wife use any rod in the boat she wanted. Then one day she say's I want my own outfit and I want to pick it out.She went to cabela's web site and found a Phluger set up I bought it for her and she loves to fish with it. Let her pick it out and she will be happier.Ohh hers is the only Phluger in the boat! Jeff V. People will forget what you said, People will forget what you did, But people will never forget how you made them feel."
561554,satchmoa,2006-10-07 08:48:00,19,WOW Kool site where else can you trade a wife for a rod and reel? I am liking this site better and better everyday.

I need to set it up the way because when she hooks a fish the rod is layed on the edge of the boat and she just winches the fish out of the water. Now you may say with a broom handle rod, and heavy line she shouldn't catch anything, but the truth is she seems to out fish most everyone in camp every year. I never get any credit for putting her on the fish, but its a gas anyway. 3/8 ounce jig and a huge tiger leach is her favorite bait. Every time she says she's hooked on a rock,I have to get the net ready and the camera out."
