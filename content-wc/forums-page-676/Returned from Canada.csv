561575,Guest,2006-10-10 10:30:00,0,"Just returned last night from a week at Donnelly's Minnitaki Lake Lodge near Sioux Lookout. The weather wasn't bad with Saturday being the best. Around 60 degrees with a light wind. However, Saturday night the wind really came up, very strong, with waves probably 3-5 foot. No way we could fish so we packed up and came home. Fished Wed-Sat with mixed results. Reefs and dropoff producted the best in 37-50 foot water. Never fished so deep, but the fish were there and the bite was pretty steady. Nothing real big, biggest being a 24"" (only one), but mostly eaters. The hardest part was staying on the fish with the wind blowing. We were the only fishermen on the lake. Most everyone was moose hunting and some we talked to had pretty good results. Can't wait until spring opener..... Overall the trip wasn't bad, but probably won't go back this late in the year. The fall leaves were beautiful, but with the wind, they're gone........"

561581,Guest,2006-10-11 09:40:00,0,"Sutsgold...didn't make it to the English River, however, we did go to Redpine and Southwest Bays. For the most part the water was pretty rough except for last Saturday. The water levels are somewhere between 4-6 feet below normal. Using the line on the banks as a guide. Harvey Narrows was a far north as we went and was up there for only one afternoon. We fished the reef off of Burnt Island probably 50% of the time, however, the day we went to Redpine and SW we found a dropoff where the wind was blowing against and caught alot of fish. Went there the next morning and the fish were gone. Tried to find them further into the bay but never did. Back to the reef! Had a great trip but dealing with the wind created a problem. We would anchor on the reef at 30' and before you knew it you would be in 50'. The anchor slid off the side of the reef. So, the troller came in handy. If you go up or have already, let me know how you came out. Thanks"
561583,Sutsgold,2006-10-11 10:42:00,219,"Thanks Eyesnatcher, we are heading up next week. Not sure how much fishing we will get done considering they are having a snow storm right now and temps are around 20. Hopefully it will be back up to more normal temps by next week. I will let you know how we did if we get out."
