561526,Guest,2006-10-04 15:26:00,0,Anyone have an idea what the plan is to open the Lockport Locks? Usually it's mid-October and messes up the fishing. I made a few calls and couldn't find an answer up there. Old veteran
561551,Guest,2006-10-06 12:38:00,0,I read they will open on the 16th. Ill be there for the rest of the week. Does this cause a big slow down for the fishing?
561552,Guest,2006-10-06 13:49:00,0,It depends on how fast they let the water out. My past experience has been that fishing take a slight drop day one and it get's a little worse each day until things settle down. Certainly not worth cancelling a trip but not ideal.
