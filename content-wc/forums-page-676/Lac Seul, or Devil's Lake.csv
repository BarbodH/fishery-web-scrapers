THE FISHING WAS GREAT AND THE SCENERY WAS BREATHTAKING. AFTER 20 YEARS OF GOING TO CANADA, THE PAST 12 HAVE BEEN ON THE NORTH-EAST END OF LAC SEUL AND I DON'T HAVE TO LOOK ANY FURTHER. MARK"
561568,wooglin,2006-10-09 16:01:00,371,"Thanks everyone for the comments, I appreciate it. It will be a difficult decision when the time comes!"
561587,Guest,2006-10-12 12:37:00,0,"I have been to both place in recent years, Devil's lake twice and Lac Seul the past five years. Devil's lake is much more hit or miss than Lac Seul. The wind can absolutely ruin a fishing trip at Devil's lake. At Lac Seul, the wind just makes it a little less convenient. I am not the gretest fisherman in the world by any stretch, however, I caught more and bigger walleye at Lac Seul in two days than at Devil's in eight. I go with people that have been fishing Devil's for 10+ years. I do not think I will ever go back to Devil's again. I catch more walleye near my home. Just my two cents."
561601,Guest,2006-10-14 00:34:00,0,"I am on the other end of the spectrum. I fish DL about 40-50 open water days/year. I live closer to about 100 MN lakes and make the 170 mile 1 way trip with a smile on my face (even with the gas prices). Havent been skunked in 4 years. Many fish the last few years 20-27 inches (yeah, cant seem to break above 28) with this last summer being the best year I have ever had up there. I concurr with Burr about the DL shoreline. If pasture is developed then yes it is. If Reservation is developed then yes it is. There are only 2 real stores on the waterfront. You have to drive back into town to get booze, bars, and food most of the time. The fishing is not typical walleye fishing when compared to Millacs, Sakakawea, Oahe, Erie, LOW, etc. You can catch Eyes in 2 FOW all year long pitching cranks, jigs, or slip bobbering. Didnt fish deeper that 15 FOW all year this year simply because I didnt have to. I have never been to Lac. I would love to do it sometime. Scenery is probably amazing. The Canadian folks are wonderful (spent many a day playing hockey in many areas there). The fishing, as fantastic as it may be, I find hard to believe would top DL; but like I said I have never been there. I have to laugh when I think about it. Seems like it should be a simple decision where to fish especially when the 2 places are so different. Poor guy, having to make this decision. I need to make it to Erie in the next year or so. My dream place to go other than DL. Dont forget about Tobin, Columbia River etc."
561606,Guest,2006-10-14 11:12:00,0,let'see. 971 miles to devil's lake. 995 miles to lac seul. think i'll stick with lac seul for now.
561449,wooglin,2006-09-29 22:36:00,371,"1,500 miles round trip - Devil's Lake or Lac Seul. You are at the fork in the road. Do you go left to Devil's Lake, or right to Lac Seul? Why?"
561459,wooglin,2006-09-30 18:27:00,371,"41 views and no comments? Both are great walleye fisheres. Pros Devil's Lake: Still in the US Cheaper gas Closer food/gas outlets Bars/Restaurants closer Limited bait restrictions More take-home limit Pros Lac Seul: It's Canada, a great experience More secluded It's Canada It's been our annual trip for 4 years Just love the drive"
561469,prov1900,2006-10-01 19:36:00,544,"Never been to Devils, but plan on it for next year. I think you answered your own question with your pros and cons. GO TO BOTH. Take two weeks, or more. If I had the choice, without knocking Devils, I would go to Lac Seul, always. Love the pine trees. Living where I do, I see similar terrain to Devils everyday. Plus, if the wind comes up, from my experience, you can always find safe haven in the forest. Not always the case on the plains. Lac Seul is amazing. Just pick a spot and fish it. Of course, some are better than others, but if it looks good, it is, and not ""probably is"", just is. Again, I will fish Devils before long. Hear great things. Probably the hottest lake in the US. Dont let all the stories about Canadian Customs scare you, if you have nothing to hide, then no problem."
561475,wooglin,2006-10-02 10:15:00,371,"Good point about the wind, I never thought of that....thansk again for your thoughts. Anyone else?"
561476,Guest,2006-10-02 14:11:00,0,Fished them both. Lac Seul several times and Devil's once. Would rather fish Lac Seul. I think the fishing is more consitant and fish are easier to find on Lac Seul and run a little bigger. The scenery on Lac Seul is also a definite plus. Since I have only spent 6 days on Devil's and about 30 on Lac Seul it might not be a fair comparison. Just my opinion and I have been wrong many times....just ask my wife!!!!!
561480,wooglin,2006-10-02 15:29:00,371,"Is it safe/fair to say that Devil's Lake would be a lot more 'commercialized' than Lac Seul? IE, everywhere you look there's bars/restaurants, hotels...etc? I asked a guy who is a hotel owner there about shore-lunches, and he said it's not really possible as all the waterfront is private.... True statement?"
561494,prov1900,2006-10-02 23:08:00,544,"I cant see that. Again, I have never even seen the place, but with the massive expanse of water (that from what I hear, is constantly on the rise), I cant believe it would be that developed. Interesting though, and I would like to hear what others have to say about that. Shorelunches were meant to be done in places like Lac Seul though. Pine trees always make walleyes/pike taste better, IMO :)"
561503,Burr,2006-10-03 14:44:00,8612,"The lake itself is not real comercialized - as the location of the shoreline has changed significantly in the last decade. The shoreline is primarily private property - imagine for a moment that todays shoreline was a half mile from shore a decade ago. Somebody owns the land. There is Graham's island - a wonderful place for 'shore lunch', very nice campground with facilities. Most restaraunts, motels, stores, are in town - a mile or two from the lake. All that being said - most shoreline is undeveloped, unless you call cow pastures 'developed' - at one time fencing in ND was considered developed. If you really had your mind set on pulling up to shore to build a campfire and cook lunch, I'm sure you could do so, with or without permission there is plenty of acceptable sites. Respecting private landowners would indicate obtaining permission the best method for a sportsman. ND trespass laws are not as restrictive as most states - just about all other states are more restrictive. For hunting - if land is not posted, you are allowed foot access to hunt it. Other states usually do not allowed open-access regardless of posting. Not sure how this would be interpreted for shore lunch access? The wind does blow up here, but with a little planning, you can always find calmer water - just be prepared to go to another access. The lake is irregular shaped, so there is always shelter somewhere. For a reference point - the 'old' shoreline is about 24 ft deep. Thats significant in the sense you can feel 'pretty safe' when water is more than 24 feet, as the trees and other obstructions are generally in shallower water - or floating... If your really talented - you can run your boat right down a fence line and hit every post with your lower unit - don't ask me how I know that... Barbed wire %&#$$#%&!!"
561548,Guest,2006-10-06 11:09:00,0,My vote would be Lac Seul. I've never fished Devil's lake but I don't care for what I've heard. I've fished Lac Seul for 18 years. It's like home.
561549,Guest,2006-10-06 11:35:00,0,Ditto...Lac Seul is the ticket. Lac Seul has been awful good to me. My buddys tell me I couldn't catch a cold but I sure catch a lot of nice Walleye on Lac Seul.
