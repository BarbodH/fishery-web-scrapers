561566,Clark,2006-10-09 15:28:00,5,"Hi all. the fishing was real bad. To get an idea do a google search on Papertown Inn, Pinefalls and check out the weights for the tournement. Cheers Clark PS the Red was real good from what we heard."

561572,freespoolin,2006-10-09 22:48:00,472,"I prefer Pine Falls to the Red River. However, I can't argue with success. We fished Pine Falls once, two weeks ago, caught 0 walleye. Have fished the Red 4 times, have landed 9 master angler walleyes in the boat (2 people). (Seven masters by one angler, unfortunately not me. Two caught cranking, 7 jigging). This is the best I've seen the Red for masters in 20 years of fishing it. Yes, you'll have to endure a lot of saugers (3 tubs of salted shiners on Oct 5, 1 1/2 tubs Oct 7, 1 tub Oct. 9). But if you're also after some eater size fish, the saugers this year are bigger. The chance to catch a master greenback is on the Red."
561573,Guest,2006-10-09 23:26:00,0,"I agree, having never fished Pine Falls before I can say it was a little disappointing, my partner and I were very discouraged at the lack of quality greenbacks. We were lucky enough to boat a few but not nearly the numbers or size that one would expect in such a rich enviroment for fish populations. We caught one river walleye and the rest were greenbacks. I need more shad raps!!! My one tip is you can never have enough shap raps when going to pine falls."
561589,Burr,2006-10-12 20:31:00,8612,"Just got back from Pine Falls and the Red today - 10-12. Good news is the water temps are down at Pine Falls, on Wednesday it was 51-52 in the river, and 47 on the bay. Bad news is the weather. Sundays wind stirred up the bay, by Wednesday, visibility 'improved' to about 8 inches - it's real muddy. We had a nice fish on, came unbuttoned, and caught a sauger (very fat) shortly after that. Maybe the bite will start with the colder water temps? We only fished the bay for 2 hours before getting blown off. Our boat was the only 1 at the papermill access - that tells ya something all by itself. We saw one other boat on the river, and were the only boat on the bay. There were loose nets west of Robinsons, I'm guessing they came loose during the Sunday wind - were floating and hooked on the Rocks. Most nets were marked well (flags), however there was one large net South of Robinsons that only had Hilex jugs (no flags), for most, including ourselves, we could not see the other jug until we were already into the net. Lots of people got in that net. We came home early due to weather. Winds today were forcast out of the north at 40 Knots, and gusting, and rain changing to snow - -8 at sunup getting up to 5 C - winds furthur north on Lake Winnipeg were forcast 90 KPH - yep - 90!!!! The bay will be stirred up again. Doesn't look like the wind will subside until Saturday afternoon - but the water will days to settle out. 14 day forcast is all colder, by next Tuesday it is not forcast to get above freezing for a daytime high. It's forcast below freezing until the 25th - Snow, Rain, Wind, Cold - EVERY DAY. We did fish the Red Sunday through Tuesday - caught Sauger and Saugeye almost at will, and a few greenbacks sprinkled in each day. Greenbacks seemed to be slowing down each day. Our best was a 29 weighed 10 lb 1 oz - CPR. Got to meet Stu while there - really great guy - nice to finally meet him. The Red is the place to be, but typically they open Lockport on Oct 15 - so if your not there now.... IMO, October looks extremely cold, maybe we'll get a late warm spell and see what November brings."
561591,Guest,2006-10-12 21:56:00,0,by the sounds of it things are pretty well the same as the weekend that the tourney was out fishing. hopefully by the time the big rigs get out on the water for the Walleye Championships things will be going strong and some big fish will be caught(not to say that some big wieghts didnt come in). Thanks to everyone at Papertown who helped out with the international great event but you really need a second launch.
561592,manitobawalleye,2006-10-13 05:56:00,885,"danny they usually go out 2 wide and the process is much faster right now there is a big washout hole on 1 side that is one of the reasons for collecting a launch fee improvements are by the users and the mill maintains the rest manitoba .... a 100,000 lakes how many walleyes ???? i will never have enough time...."
561593,Burr,2006-10-13 06:22:00,8612,"The north wind has raised the river levels, both sides are usable. I had never seen the river as low as it was last Friday. By Wednesday, Treaty rock was completely under water. By the difference in the floating dock walking ramp, water was up about 4 feet as compared to Saturday. There is very little flow through the dam, but the lower water temps will help bring them in. The fish just were not in yet with the warmer temps during the voyagers derby."
