1058044,jfsh,2008-09-30 09:26:00,13,"Thanks for your report. Fished LOTW out of Morson back in the 90's around this time of year. Sure do miss the crappie fishing in Obabikon. We just returned on Saturday, 9/27/08, from a one week trip fishing the Seine River chain of lakes west of Atikokan. Experienced very similar results as you did. Water temps in the low 60's, most weeds still green, fish scattered and not concentrated in the fall pattern yet. Largest northern was 41"", largest walleye and smallmouth only around 20"". Mild temps: up to 70's during the day, 40's at night. Water level was normal. Unlike last year, there hasn't been a freeze yet. Most importantly our group of eight guys had a great time. ken"
1058053,Guest,2008-09-30 10:23:00,0,"Spent 10 days (Sept. 13-22nd) fishing out of Souix Narrows and the Yellow Girl and Chisolm area. Very good weather, one rainy nite, partly cloudy and moderate winds most of the time. Targeted Walleyes as usual. My group of four caught and released over 300; largest was 22.5"" the rest averaged about 18"". Got some incidental pike also, fishing jigs and minnows or crawlers, the largest Pike was 42.5 (22.5lbs) Most were between 33 and 38"" but fun as **** on 8lb line! Looked for Crappies one day, no success..... Can't wait to go back next year! JIMI R."

1058093,Bill Krejca,2008-09-30 15:02:00,6107,"Thanks, Juls, I really appreciate the site (and gave it credit in my book) and just don't want to take advantage. However, since asked, the name of the book is ""A North Woods Fisherman's Story"", the story of my late father's God's Country adventures from 1926 through 1997. It covers camping/fishing adventures in northern Minnesota and exploring LOW starting in 1936, particularly Whitefish Bay and Turtle Portage. Contact me for details, or do a Google. Bill Krejca"
1056887,Bill Krejca,2008-09-23 12:52:00,6107,"Got back Saturday from a week at LOW. We stayed at Young's Wilderness Camp in Stevens Bay. The fishing was fair overall, but not as good as last year, same time. Water temperature varied from 63 to 59 degrees, depending on whether the sun was out. I would guess the season was about 2 weeks behind, e.g., more like August than Sep. Leaves were just beginning to turn when we left. Water level about the same as last year. Crappies were the targeted species, I find I usually catch about everything else in the process. As usual, red/white tube jigs and some home tied jigs caught just about everything. We used no live bait. Fished the Hay island area, felt it was definitely not peaked, but managed to do alright. The area near camp produced fairly consistently, as did the narrows near Turtle Lake. Boated over to Obabikon Lake one calm day, did well on crappies after spending a good deal of time finding the biters. The wind, or rather the lack thereof, was a factor, as it normally is fairly easy to find the biters when it blows. Biggest crappie was 14"", we got quite a few 13 or better, and came back with a nice bunch. On the way back, stopped over at Obabikon (Camp), and chatted with Jared and friend George. Had a good discussion of the present state of fishing, and of cabbages and kings. Largest walleye was 22"", next was 20"", not too bad when we really didn't fish for them. One of our guys lost a nice muskie, not too hard to do when you are using 4 lb line; you could see the line streaking for the surface and the predictable jump, usually doesn't take much guessing to figure out what is on before you see it. One jump, and it was gone. Six Swedish pike fishermen were staying at camp, targeting muskies. They did rather well, boating and releasing 41 during their week's stay. All the muskie folks did well. The water in Sabaskong seemed clearer than usual, although the bloom was in full force closer to Obabikon. Back next year, just a little bit later. Bill Krejca"
1056986,rockpt,2008-09-23 19:58:00,589,"Thanks for the report, Bill. Sounds like a great trip. We head up Oct. 3 for nine days. Curious to see if the warm weather is going to hold or give way to more seasonable temps. Never know what you're going to get up there in the fall. Oct. 2003 was t-shirt weather all week with skeeters still around and 2006 we had a snowstorm with three days of blowing snow and frozen pipes."
1057012,fishncamp,2008-09-23 21:49:00,49,Thanks for the report....spent a weekend in august and a weekend in september at Young's targeting muskies. Nice people and nice camp!
1057045,patrick,2008-09-24 06:37:00,277,"thanks for the report, sounds like a good trip"
1057101,1700SS,2008-09-24 10:50:00,104,"Bill,Glad to hear you had a good trip. Maybe one of these years we will catch up with each other. Bill is right on with his report. 7 of us were up the same week, staying at Red Wing Lodge. Only one other cabin filled that week. I sure hope business picks up for you resort owners soon!! 50% of my time was fishing crappies/walleyes and the other time was spent chasing muskies. Found a nice school of crappies in the Hay island area, but most were smaller fish. Hit the Elbow a couple times and just hammered them one afternoon, nice size also, up to 13 1/2"". Thompson Creek was very slow for us this year, could not find the fish, maybe we just did not look hard enough. Walleye's were hit and miss for us also, but got into quite a few up too 27"". All crappie and walleye caught on jig and plastic. Muskies, we boated only 10 between the 7 of us, up to 47"". Cowgirls and big spinnerbaits were the ticket. Not much action on glide baits or topwater. Bill, PM me and give me the inside scoop on the 41 muskies them guys boated, please. Jared, sorry did not stop by, seen you guys are working on that new cabin, looks nice. I will be by next year.Brett"
1057130,snaggletooth,2008-09-24 13:51:00,135,"Bill, Thanks for the report! I truly love that area. My partner & I usually fish out of Duck Bay Lodge for a week each year. We were unable to get there this year due to job committments. Did you notice if Young's is still selling the ""Novak"" glide baits ? They are small, handmade, wood muskie jerk baits that usually look like panfish. Chuck"
1057143,Bill Krejca,2008-09-24 15:04:00,6107,"Snag - I didn't notice re: Novak bait, but they had a bunch, so maybe there were some. Re: Duck Bay: For years, I used to camp about a mile around the corner from the camp, across from the narrows. The spot got really hit with the tornado in '94, used to be a beautiful point with a huge white pine that shaded it. George, whom I mentioned was at Obabikon Camp, guides sometimes for Duck Bay, perhaps you know him. Bill Krejca"
1057373,snaggletooth,2008-09-25 14:48:00,135,"Bill, George the musician? Yes, we met Gerorge once, at the dock in Morson, while preparing to leave for Hay Is. He was leaving to go somewhere that day. (he sure looks like Pete Mania!) Everyone at the lodge has told us we must hire him for musky, but its never come together for us. We've really enjoyed fishing with Thatcher Haggberg from Nestor Falls. Thatcher has also shown us some wonderful fishing on Crow. Did you ever meet Dr Lund ? Or read any of his books about the area ? It sounds like you were camping rather close to his cabin."
1057378,1shooter,2008-09-25 15:20:00,1493,I'll be in the Miles Bay area tomorrow. You have any tips?
1057557,Bill Krejca,2008-09-26 15:33:00,6107,"Snag - Yes, we camped just east of Duane's cabin, and earlier used to stay at Turtle Portage Camp, when it was running, a number of years ago. Although we never knowingly met, we corresponded in 2002 when I was doing research for my book, which is related closely to that area. I have several of his books, which are interesting and informative. Bill Krejca"
