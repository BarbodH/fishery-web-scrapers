I've spent about 80 weeks fishing fly-in waters around Red Lake and it's always great. You probably need another trip to Trout. Do as I do and spend two or three weeks on you next visit to Trout. Extra weeks come cheaper. I'm looking at two weeks on Little Vermillion in May and 3 or 4 weeks in August. Also intend to be there for several days that include Thanksgiving."
