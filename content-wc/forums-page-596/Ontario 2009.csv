We'll be going fishing in 2009. My guys will have their deposits to me before Christmas. We've been doing this every year beginning in 1983. At least two cabins for at least the walleye opener week every year. No rush for August, but we'll be up there.Your advice is good."

People who do the trip every year, reserve the same weeks when they leave. Now's the time to get the first couple weeks in June if you want them!"
