1057126,Boots,2008-09-24 13:37:00,19,We were contemplating a sept. 2009 fishing trip to that area and heard the bridge was to be completed this month in Sept. Hope we can make it there next year. How did you do on walleyes when you were there?
1057350,JDP,2008-09-25 11:45:00,1457,I spoke on the phone with a Mahkwa Lodge manager in August. He indicated that a bridge was in the process of being constructed that would enable driving dirtectly to the resort (no need to launch at Archie's Landing and boat-in your group and supplies). The road to the lodge already has been in place for a while. The bridge will be finished this year. He also stated that a boat launch is being created at the resort for private boats. In 2009 Mahkwa Lodge clients will be able to drive to the resort and launch thier private boats. JDP
