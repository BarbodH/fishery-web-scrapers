1053529,dutchboy,2008-09-05 15:48:00,5717,Is there anywhere on-line I can look at a map of Lac Seul that has bays and rivers ect. marked? I would like to follow along on some of the discussions here and knowing the lay of the lake would sure help. Thank you..............

They are section maps about 3'x3' but I had to create my own because the area of the lake I fish was right on the corners of 4 different ones. So after some cutting and pasteing and going to Kinko's for some copies and laminating, I finally have what I was looking for. Good Luck!"

They should give you everything you are looking for and are easy to read. The problem is that it takes four maps to cover the entire lake. Their web address is www.awcl.ca/ If you go to the home page and click on Tourist Camp Supplies it will show you the key to the four maps. Also they do have an 800 number listed that you can call and order the areas you are interested in. WP - Sioux Falls"

This takes you to another page - hit ""map this location""Change map background to Can. NRCan+names and you should get what your looking for.Good luck.You can also insert your GPS files to see where you got lost last time. I would send you a file of my last trip to Lac Seul but the post does not accept *.gpx (GPS files)."
