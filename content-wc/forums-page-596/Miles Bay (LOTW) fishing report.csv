1056726,Guest,2008-09-22 17:31:00,0,"Two days ago I caught lots of 15-16 inch walleyes in mud portage. Today, they were all small... I think the schools are moving in and out, and they school according to size. Also, I caught 10 slab crappie in there today... mixed in with the small walleyes. That's the only reason we stayed there. Crappie fishing has been a little slow. Everything is on minnows... I don't even try anything else."
1056751,JTCUSTOM,2008-09-22 18:56:00,8,"I just returned form my trip to lotw morson. Fishing was good but small fish dominated. I went to the elbow twice and did good one day and not so good the second. For walleye in the begining of my trip most fish were caught deep 18-24 ft. As the weateher warmed I started to catch them shallow. Largest for the trip was 22"" wallleye, 19"" smallmouth, 14"" crappie, 12"" perch, approx 8lb northern, and we also boated a muskie over 40"" All these fish were caught on one style of rig. Medium size mac's smile blade w/ one stack bead and 2.5"" gulp minnows. Various color combos were used. I have not used live bait for 2 years and won't change in the future. All on gulp,power bait and 4"" chomppers drop shot worms. I fished from sabaskong bay to pony island, south end of miles, obabikon lake. The best areas were heavy with current. Also caught good crappie all over the lake in deep water, but keepers were few and far between. Jon T"
1055216,1shooter,2008-09-14 18:04:00,1493,I will be up there in 2 weeks and was wondering how the fishing is going. I've never been up there this time year as we always go in the spring. Is it pretty much the same deal? Jigs with minnows or crawlers and fish the reefs and points?
1055360,Obabikon,2008-09-15 10:31:00,2370,"Walleyes are biting in the entrance to Mud Portage... which is on the far east side of Miles Bay. Also, by the time you get here, I'm sure the crappies will be going crazy in Bottle Bay and the smaller bay just to the south of their... (we call it Bottle Bass Bay)"
1055547,birddogger,2008-09-16 10:08:00,43,Obabikan Where exactly is Mud portage? Thank you for your help.
1055605,Lazy Fisherman,2008-09-16 14:58:00,276,Also Obabikon Where is Bottle Bay? I have never heard of that bay before.
1055623,Obabikon,2008-09-16 16:15:00,2370,The area we call Mud Portage is on the far east side of Miles Bay. Just keep going east and you'll see a small island with several reefs to the north of it. Fish that shoreline... and north to the mouth of a cove. Bottle bay is a bay to the east of Thompson's creek. The bay itself holds a cabin which has a large boat house. Fish the small opening into the bay and out... but not in the actual bay itself.
1055842,alanb,2008-09-17 14:22:00,56,"Thank Obabikon. I learned something new about Bottle Bay in the fall. Maybe next year I can talk the wife into a second fishing trip to LOTW! I asked my father-in-law if he knew about the fall Crappie fishing (his family owns the cabin on Bottle Bay), and said when they used to make the annual fishing trip from Illinois in the fall, that the Crappie's were always great fishing in this location. I think they switched to the spring opener for Walleye because they were spending more time gambling and drinking instead of fishing! There is a good structure rise going into Bottle Bay, with it forming a hill right at the narrowest point. If memory serves right, it goes from roughly 20' up to 4' at the narrows in the bay opening and then back down to 10' inside Bottle Bay. Good fishing location any time of the year if you want to troll in and out of the bay. GPS coordinates are roughly: Latitude=49.27, Longitude=-94.31 if your not sure of Bottle Bay on the map. Alan Only 240 days to the spring opener"
1056413,1shooter,2008-09-20 13:21:00,1493,What are they biting n right now?
1056439,Guest,2008-09-20 18:13:00,0,"It's been tough the last few days. People have been telling me sunken trees in 20ft of water... Walleyes are easy, but the big ones aren't. Mud Portage is still producing lots of fish."
1056476,1shooter,2008-09-21 07:36:00,1493,what kind of bait are they using?
1056641,Tony Shirley,2008-09-22 09:58:00,211,Any good walleyes around the 16 inch to 18 inch in mud portage?
