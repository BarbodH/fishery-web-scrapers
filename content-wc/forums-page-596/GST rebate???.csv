The outfitter can do the rebate if he is willing to on his end, a little more paperwork for them, but less hassle for the customer and you don't risk not getting it back."
1055036,phishfearme,2008-09-13 17:22:00,1242,"GNO - thanks for the reply! so, i'm filling out form GST115E acting as a tour operator (which i was for my group), submitting the form with the original receipt (claiming 50% of the GST paid) and mailing it to the tax center in PEI. this sound right to you? (the receipt shows lodging and air service as well as boats and motors as well as ""sold to"" - me). thanks, phish"
1055041,2Labs,2008-09-13 17:53:00,685,"I have already received a rebate for my July trip to LOW. The camp operator sent it in for me. They specifically said ""The rebate program says the rebate is only for a guided trip"" and they documented for me who did the guiding by writing it on the rebate application form. The rebate came about 6 weeks after it was sent in."
1055106,phishfearme,2008-09-14 07:19:00,1242,"2labs - glad you got your rebate. reading the application, it states ""an eligible tour package must include either short-term and/or camping accomodations in canada and at least one service"" - that one service can be guiding but not necessarily. i believe for example that flight services are acceptable also (which is what we have). seems as clear as mud. thanks, phish"
1055183,GNO,2008-09-14 14:17:00,153,"That sounds right. I don't have to mail it in, I have to submit it with ny GST remittance. It will take a while for it to come back I am sure. It took me 3 or 4 months to get a letter stating that my packages qualified and what I needed to do to automatically rebate 1/2 the GST."
1055231,phishfearme,2008-09-14 18:58:00,1242,GNO - thanks - it's in the mail tomorrow. will report back. phish
1055760,Matches,2008-09-17 07:52:00,236,Here is quite a bit of information about the GST rebate program. should answer most questions.http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/gi/no...tml#P203_23858
1055831,phishfearme,2008-09-17 13:43:00,1242,"matches, yah, i had read this previously but since then a new FAQ was added and answered - it's exactly my situation: 3.27 Accommodation at a fishing outpost camp in Canada, flights to and from the outpost camp, a motorized boat and gasoline are sold for an all-inclusive price. The cost of the fishing licence is charged separately. Is this an eligible tour package under the new FCTIP? (New question) The fishing licence is not part of any tour package because it is sold separately by another supplier, i.e. a province. The items sold for an all-inclusive price  accommodation at a fishing outpost camp, flights, motorized boat, and gasoline  are an eligible tour package. The package includes short-term accommodation in Canada and a service. The service in this package is the air transportation. thanks, phish"
