1054985,lassh,2008-09-13 10:28:00,553,"The Doug Gayle Gawley run Woman River Outposts. They bought Woman River Outposts from Les and Sandy Schultz years ago. I have been to 4 of their fly-in lakes when Les ran the operation. I flew once with the Gawleys during the transiton year. Gawleys also run Little Beaver Lodge on Lac Seul and several fly-ins from Little Beaver. Most of the posts here speak positively of Doug. We would probably still be going with Gawley but he would not honor an agreement we had with the previous owners for keeping ""our week"" on a particular lake after we ""swapped"" for one of his other lakes in the transition year. We had some really good fishing on some of the larger fly-in lakes serviced by Woman River."

Passengers Held Up After Mouse Spotted on FlightPassengers on a KLM flight were delayed at Nice airport for five hours after one of the passengers spotted a mouse. The Dutch pilot refused to take off for Amsterdam until technicians had checked the whole plane to make sure the mouse hadn't nibbled through any cables.The passengers later resumed their journey on another flight, reports Het Laatste Nieuws. Hours later the plane was allowed to fly to Schiphol, with the mouse believed to be still on board.--------------------------------The WoW Power Leveling ( World of warcraft Power Leveling ) site offer buy WoW Power Leveling, cheap WoW Power Leveling, free wow power leveling, 1- 70 level wow power leveling and wow power leveling news!"
