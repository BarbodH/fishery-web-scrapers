1055249,Guest,2008-09-14 20:28:00,0,Leaving in thursday for a flyout 90 miles nw of Red Lake. Any reports from the outposts up that way? How is walleye fishing? I'll be on the Berens River system. Heard bugs are still bad. How deep are the fish? Has turnover happened yet?

A good idea anyway because of the recent 18"" of rain in that area. Not trying to alarm you, should be okay. Fishing could be changed a little from other years. I wouldn't expect bugs to be much of a problem. I should be in that general area right now for a two week stay, but work called. I'm in the barrel instead of the boat."
1055635,cspierings,2008-09-16 16:58:00,230,I was on Lac Seul the week of the 10th. Very few bugs at all. I can't imagine further north being worse. Good luck

Yes, some mosquitos are still out on calm morning/warm days. Fishing was better earlier in the week, losts of 20"" fish. Largest was 25"" with several 24s. Most fish were caught vertical jigging in 15' to 25' of water. Water temp was between 57 to 60 degrees. Turn over on Hornby is always a question for us, however, I did notice more floating vegetation later in the week (when fishing slowed down). Good luck."
