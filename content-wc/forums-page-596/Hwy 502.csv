1055035,cspierings,2008-09-13 17:20:00,230,I went up 502 on the 3rd and back down it on the 10th. I've never driven that road when it was in such good shape. I can't say as much for the bridge from Fort Frances across the Rainy we got held up for about an hour while they were working on it. Sailed through the border both ways.
1050093,JAY221,2008-08-18 18:28:00,877,"We came back down 502 Saturday morning(8/16). About 10 miles from the end going south a boat trailer in front of us had a tire just shred apart. Got down to the end where the restrooms are on the left & found that we had a right rear going flat. Changed it out & crossed over the border & found Stock Tire Co on the east side of 53. They were great about fixing the tire & asked if I came down 502. When I replied that I had he said I was # 9 for the morning(9:15 A.M.) that had come down 502 & had a flat. The wait times weren't bad on 502 & I wasn't pulling anything but it is tough on tires! Later, Jay"
1050096,Golden Eagle,2008-08-18 18:41:00,2642,"Estimated end of construction is September 5, 2008. Just in time for my September 12 drive up north. 19.10 kilometers are being worked on."
1050300,wiswalleye,2008-08-19 17:47:00,62,"Unless you're meeting someone else, coming from So Colorado why not take I-29 and enter Canada in Manitoba just north of Pembina, ND. You can bypass Winnepeg and catch Hi-way 1 East to Ontario where it turns into 17 to Vermillion Bay. You can also by-pass Kenora if you want. Decent roads, some constuction between Kenora and Vermillion Bay but not to bad. They're not working on the road itself, but blasting and moving rock to make it wider I guess."
1051229,hondachris,2008-08-24 16:41:00,7,just went down 502 2 days ago and there is gravel for about 13 miles. They had just watered it so i had a layer of gravel/dust/water coated onto my boat and truck that took me 3 hours to clean off.
1052235,Guest,2008-08-29 11:09:00,0,We came thru there yesterday about 7:am and the gravel had been coated with some oil or something that does not come off with soap and water. But it was good road once you get past that part and that part was god for a gravel road.
1052251,Golden Eagle,2008-08-29 12:53:00,2642,"Ministry of Transportation still posts that completion date is September 5, 2008. Sounds like a reach to me.I hope this thread keeps it's legs because I hope to be on the highway September 12. I'm flying in but can post from camp around September 13 or 14 to give my road report.Don't want black tar on my white van."
1052479,jka333,2008-08-31 10:02:00,14,"502 was fine. there was a ten mile stretch of re-paving being done. we managed to hit it just right going up......and got through while the southbound had to wait for our line of northbound to get through. i'd say the construction project, with gravel....kept us down to 40mph....and was not a factor at all. jka333"
1052796,Guest,2008-09-02 09:33:00,0,"I drove south on 502 Friday evening (the 29th). Construction crews would have been done for the week, but all surfacing was complete, no gravel anywhere, and the road is in the best shape since I started going in the mid-80's. I can't promise no delays, since I don't know what work remains, but there are no gravel portions. We took 71 on the way up, and had several construction delays of 5 minutes or less."
1052871,Guest,2008-09-02 14:13:00,0,Just came back from a trip to Sioux Lookout on Sunday. 502 was probably the best I have ever seen since I have been heading up there. The paving was complete and when we were heading north last Thursday we were following the striper. By Sunday all of the striping was complete.
1055007,walleyeduran,2008-09-13 12:11:00,286,"Has anyone been on 502 resently, will be heading up on the 20th of sep. and was hoping that the gravel section on 502 would be paved by then. Thanks, Duran"
1046797,Moondog,2008-08-01 22:53:00,362,What's the condition of the 502 from Ft. Frances to Vermillion Bay?? We have been going up 71 for a few years since the 502 sucked so bad. Have they repaired it? Leaving Sunday from way down here in Southern Colorado for Gull Rock. Ya know........you almost can't get there from here.
1046799,rather-be-fishin,2008-08-01 23:31:00,429,"I just got back today and traveled up 502 and back 71.....502 first section is OK....then there are several miles of road construction which is pretty rough....then gets better before Dryden.... Hwy 71 also has some bridge road construction with stop lights, but in general not bad....is a little further travel route...but less construction... However, I think I would still do a circle route ~ up 502 and back 71....just to keep things interesting and beautiful scenery both ways..... Have a great time fishing!!!"
1047101,Guest,2008-08-04 07:28:00,0,"Went up and came back in mid July. There was a stretch of maybe 20 miles in the middle that was terrible, big potholes everywhere, as bad as ever. Slowed down to 40 mph as a result. I guess it will never be possible to fix the whole thing at once."
1047160,Guest,2008-08-04 12:09:00,0,Wow!!!! Traveled 502 @ the end of June this year. I thought it was in decent shape then Mustah got messed up in a hurry.
1047728,eyewitness,2008-08-06 14:35:00,680,"Heading up 502 on Sat......Do they have the road torn up for miles? Typically the Canadiens use a silicate spray on the gravel sections to keep the dust down. When it rains it is like a slick oily film that gets all over everything and is a major pain in the a$$ to get your truck and boat clean. It also stains your covers and tires. IF they are just doing pot hole repair then it isn't too bad, or if it is dry. However, would like to keep the brand new rig free of that stuff. Any input would be appreciated.thanks!"
1047864,Guest,2008-08-07 07:44:00,0,"Only gravel sections were where they had replaced some culverts and had not asphalt patched. Most of them you could fly over until you found a deep one. Generally about normal condition. Culvert salesman had a good year. Patches seem to be awfully rough, no attempt to level with surrounding surface. Came back Aug 3"
1047915,eyewitness,2008-08-07 10:40:00,680,Thanks!
1048210,2746,2008-08-08 20:27:00,3206,Just got back tonight and traveled 502 this morning. There is now a few miles of gravel and today it was a mess! My boat and truck are as dirty as I've seen them but should wash off. Looks like there will be several miles of gravel befor the job is complete.
1048471,new hips,2008-08-10 19:01:00,498,"Just got back, there is a 10 miles section which is gravel, otherwise not to bad."
1050023,eyewitness,2008-08-18 11:55:00,680,"Just got back from my annual Lac Seul trip. The 10-12 miles of newly laid gravel was a major downer. Just put brand new Towtector rock guard on my truck (thank God!) or damage would have been even more severe. As it was, I slowed down to a crawl and my brand new 50K rig got the crap dinged out of it. Needless to say I am not too happy. If you have an older rig or don't care what happens to your boat and trailer take 502. Otherwise, I'd block out an extra 1-1-1/2 hours and go the Kenora route. Lots of road crew slow downs and stoppages, but all good road.....PS: Found tons of walleyes in 5-8 FOW in the cabbage. Actually was better fishing than deeper humps........and lots more fun!"
