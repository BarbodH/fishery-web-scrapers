Was told, by guide, that eagle lake out produce Lac Suel in numbers of fish caught this year. We usally take a day trip to Lac Suel, not this year because we were hammering the eye's. This was our 4 year at Temple Bay, normally the fall trip is 25 fish per boat, this year is was 80 -100.....it sure was summer like weather in Sept. This was not the norm for us, will be going back again next year."

Have been back a couple times since then, with the most recent being this spring. Each time we return we comment about the improved fishing so it's clearly getting better.......as to outproducing Lac Seul this year I'm not sure how anyone would know that. Can imagine why an Eagle Guide would say that though. Lots of good places to fish on Eagle and an interesting lake to be on.....sure want your GPS!"

The Lodge acquired a launch site on Lac Seul a few years ago for that purpose. The last two years, I know that some guides have been doing fewer day trips to LS, because Eagle has been producing so well. I've fished them both and like them both - good walleye numbers on Lac Seul, and nice fishing variety and improving walleye numbers on Eagle. Dave"
