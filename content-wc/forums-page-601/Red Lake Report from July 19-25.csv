1045539,frozen fish,2008-07-27 21:33:00,92,"We fished Red Lake from Saturday July 19 to Friday July 25. The week started off slowly as there had been a major mayfly hatch and the water was full of larvae.Fishing improved by mid-week with Wednesday and Thursday as good days. Friday was so windy that boat control was a problem but we did manage to do reasonably well and got wet in the process.Finding fish in the 14""-18"" range was a problem all week, lots of fish >19"" and many, many dinkers.Water temp was 67F-71F.We fished Red Lake only, did not fish Keg or Gull Rock. We fished Windy Point, Pine Island, King Island, Dorion, Slate Bay, Martin Bay, Wolf Narrows. We often found that a spot would produce a few fish and then we'd have to continue the milk run to find more active fish. Crawlers and minnows worked equally well. We have booked for next year at Sunset Lodge."
