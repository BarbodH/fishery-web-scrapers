They come thru the screens of the camper and dine while we are sleeping. Big 'Eyes? Big Northern? Anybody been back in Ranger? Thanks"

I was using a blue spinner and minnow but others around me were jigging and getting fish too.Looks like the mayfly hatch has ended and the walleye are starting to get back to their nornal diet. good news for us, bad news for the walleye!!!!"
