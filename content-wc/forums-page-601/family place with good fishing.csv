1045261,Guest,2008-07-25 21:56:00,0,"Thinking of taking the family and maybe my parents to Canada next year. I'd like to find a place that offers a nice, drive-to, lodge with some family amenities. Clean grounds, a nice clean beach safe for kids (no hooks in the sand), no weeds. Cabins that have indoor plumbing, coaches, clean, Sat TV a plus. Not a typical fishermans cabin, but it doesn't need to be plush either. Preferably, within 30-40 minutes to a town. Somewhere that does some catering to families, but doesn't need to be over-the-top. Most of all, I'd like for them to experience Canada still. I'd like to be able to take the family fishing and get numbers of walleye and some quality. I'm a fairly competent canadian walleye fisherman, but my kids will lose interest if we really have to struggle for action, so it needs to be a solid lake that a guide won't be neccessary. A chance to see wildlife. Not a lake that is filled with private cabins or overcrowded with fisherman. Needs to feel remote. We would be traveling thru I-Falls, so anywhere North of there. Price range, I'm hoping to pay around $700-$900 (each) for my wife, parents and me for a week. Much less for my kids, they are all under 10. Housekeeping is fine, and 2 boats included. Alot to ask huh??? Thought I would try! Any suggestions would be appreciated!"

1045323,tackleman,2008-07-26 11:53:00,444,"iagree with the last poster. Gullrock lake is 15 minutes to Red Lake for shopping. 20 minutes to the golf course.The resort across the bay from my house has the sand beach, sheltered swimming area, lots of docking, good fishing (right offf the dock for the kids at night) and is very reasonable. I believe (though not really sure) that they buy golf passes so their guests can partake of that if theyso desire.As mentioned earlier, gullrock is an amazing fishery and even the first time angler can get fish without much trying.the camp across the bay is South Bay on Gullrock and is run by Mary & Harry Spencely. the phone number is 807-727-2830. She tells me she does most of her bookings over the internet so give it a google."

1045732,Guest,2008-07-28 20:13:00,0,"Thanks to everyone for your replys! I wish the South Beach had some pictures of their beach. My girls would be spending probably 70% of there time there while the boys go fishing. I know GullRock is a great fishing lake and it was on my short list. Does anyone know how nice the beach is? Is it set-up for swimming or to mostly pull boats up on shore? I think the facilities on Abram lake Park look really nice, and the beach looks top notch. How far of a drive by boat is it to Lac Suel? I heard mixed reports on fishing in Abrams, but it says Lac Suel is close by. Thanks for the suggestions guys. Any more?"
