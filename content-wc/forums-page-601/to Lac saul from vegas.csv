When we live in chicago we used to go up to canada every year. 3 years ago we moved to the vegas area. there are no walleye out here that are edible. last year we wasted a trip up to saschatchawan for the most dissapointing trip ever. Now I am thinking about maybe flying from here to somewhere close to lac saul at ear falls, what would be the closest do you think we could get? we stayed at timberlane lodge for about 15 years but with all the raves about evergreen i was thinking about 2 weeks there next year or the year after. we would not want to rent a car or bring any fish back home with us. thanks. alan"

If cost is no concern, then you could fly to Thunder Bay and Bearskin Airlines will take you pretty much anywhere with a landing strip. You could also check out Wasaya, which services many of the remote communities further north. Otherwise, your best bet is Winnipeg, leaving you about a 4.5 hour drive to Ear Falls. NWO Fishing Bum"

1045791,Guest,2008-07-29 06:19:00,0,the cheapest way i found when i was travelling from the east coast was to fly into minn-st paul and rent a compact car for the 9 hour drive up.

Uzzi. we drove 2000 miles each way to tobin lake bacause of all the raving about it. we are used to the lodges being separated by a good distance and the brochures they sent looked that way too but actually its a small town of resorts right next to each other, no truth in advertising there. the lake is completely open with no wind breaks so it was so windy no one could get on the lake for 4 days then i found out later the fish were contaminated to the point that it was unsafe to eat more than one meal a month. It might have had the record walleye caught there but it did not help us."
