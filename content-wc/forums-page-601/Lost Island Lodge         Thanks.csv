Six of us fished for 5 days and caught over 1400 Walleye a 41"" Pike and my wife hooked up on a Musky (estimated 40"") on a jig/minnow that broke off at the boat. Biggest eye was 28"" with a good amount of over slot fish caught every day. Seemed that the eyes were starting to school up and most were caught in 6' to 12'water. Hot jig colors were char,pink, orange char two tone. Thanks again to the great folks at Lost Island Lodge. Their service is great and they run a top notch operation. Good luck, Mike Kansas"

We ran about 45 minutes everyday to get on the Walleyes. It was well worth the run because we stayed on fish most all of the day. There was a fair amount of floating debris but it wasn't a problem. The lake actually rose about 4"" while we were there because of some rain and I think the rising water helped the fish activity."

One can sure travel to 45 minutes from Lost lake to Lac Seul, but the fishing is quite good within a seven mile area from the lodge, and it is quite good off of the dock of the lodge as well. Wife pulled out a 22 inch eye last night around 4:30. Fish have good girth to them this year so they are eating well. Best spots local to the lodge so far this year are the bridges the one behind the Wood mill and the one at the opposite end of the lakes. The eyes have been running deep so far 25-35 feet down. We will be coming back again next year for our 4th year in a row..good fishing..and good folks are found up at Lost Island Lodge."
1046097,Guest,2008-07-30 07:39:00,0,Great to hear that you are catching fish close to Lost Island Lodge. We always book Basil for 5 days mostly because my wife thinks he is the Cats Meow when it comes to finding a bunch of eyes and he cooks a great shore lunch. I have learned over the years that if I keep her happy when she goes fishing it allows me to fish a lot more. She has caught some nice eyes off the dock there too and who couldnt' enjoy the great hospitality at the Gazebo. Say Hi to Shane and the gang from me. Mike Kansas Mike Saresky
