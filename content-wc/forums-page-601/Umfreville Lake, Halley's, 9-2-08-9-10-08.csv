Anyone who has been to caribou falls landing who has any tips or info would be great. What's the fishing like up their this time of year, I went in June of 07 and it wasn't bad. Thanks for any help."
1045582,Sean,2008-07-28 07:21:00,160,I may be going up on Sept 12.There is a thread in the Canada section and this may get more attention there. I'm sure a mod will move it to there. I think the fish will be in the same place as you found them in the spring.
