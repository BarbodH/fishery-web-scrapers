533244,Guest,2003-07-06 14:07:00,0,"Spent a week at Way North and here is the report. The camp is located on South Trout Lake which has walleye and lake trout. Largest walleye 24"", largest lake trout 3 pds. Was told by camp mgr. this is as big as they normally get. Walleye size fell off to 8"" to 18"". Numbers were 10 walleye and 12 lake trout for the week for 4 fishermen. Portaged to North Trout Lake which has northern pike and lake trout. Largest northern was 20"", largest lake trout 5 pds. Numbers were 25 northerns and 5 lake trout again by 4 fishermen. The portage to Favourable Lake is an adventure it entails a 25 min. ride on a barge with most everyone in camp. A 20 min. ride in a ATV or on a wagon behind one on the path from ####, then a 45 min. boat ride to either arm of the lake. With loading and loading equipment the normal time fish best spot and/or return to camp is 2 hours each way. The lake has northerns and walleyes. Numbers were 150 northerns largest 40"", 3 over 34"" and rest 24"" or less, 125 walleyes largest 20"", most 16"" again by 4 fishermen. The other 2 portage lakes Lemonade and Borland were unavailable (no boats) or not worth going to (according to mgmnt.). The fly-in lake, Setting Net turned out a largest northern of 38"" one day but none over 32"" another day plus many small walleyes. This was reported to me as my party did not go there. The cabin we stayed in was OK but in bad repair with see through log walls with no ceilings probably not good for most women. The boats and motors were OK except for the swivel seats were all broke down and hard on the back. Camp owners very cordial. Rating on a scale of 10 maybe a 4 very disapointing."
533245,Vitreum,2003-07-06 15:53:00,221,it appears to me that you guys are generous with your ratings. it also appears that you paid a bunch of dough to experience this wonderful fishing.
533279,Guest,2003-07-07 11:10:00,0,">Indyguy, How!!!! sounds like you had a totally diferent experience at Way North than we did this year. Check my report first week of June ""in the records now"" Sure sounds like your fish numbers were VERY low? Were the mayflys hatching? Was this your first time up? Did the management help? Did you fish with a guide? How were you fishing? What was the weather like? We have always had GREAT fishing when we go. In fact this year was all you could ask for and then some. I agree the trip to favorable is rather unique but we always caught fish to make up the time spent getting there. I don't think it took us 2 hours each way but never clocked it. And I wouldn't spend 4 hours each day NOT fishing. Why do you think the fishing was SLOW? Just to give you a differnet point of view on North Trout the last day we were there, prior to fly out we spent three hours fishing right by where the boats were beached. Caught 6 Pike between 35 to 41 inches and 10 to 12 trout around the 5 lb range. But fishing is fishing and things do change. Did you go over to Setting Net? How was that? Sorry to hear you didn't have a better time."
533281,Guest,2003-07-07 11:23:00,0,"Indyguy, As you know I do most of the bookings for waynorth. I do not doubt the honesty of your report one bit. I am sure the fishing was not good at all during the week while you where there. Fishing is fishing and as we all know weather, water levels, patterns, skill, tactics, and plain luck all have a vote in fishing success or lack there of. I am not offering excuses in this post but I am trying to explain why I think you did not experience the awesome fishing that many of our guests have with trophy pike and numbers of walleye and trout. I will start with the weather. This spring (or lack there of) has been the warmest in years. You may so what, but with this warm pattern it has drastically changed the fishing patterns that we are so used to. I have had snow in june but this year we had 75 to 80 degrees and sunny for about 25 days straight from May 28th untill now! For example, I have been going there for the last 9 years and most years in the first full week in june. Normally that's 2 to 3 weeks after ice out and the big pike are in shallow water bays and in the mouths of the creeks in fav. and setting net. This year the ice was out for 6 weeks and the fish were out of the shallows but not yet in weed beds as they were not up yet. So it took me three days to figure out the pattern for big fish and when i did we got 11 pike over 40 (including one 46.5)and about 50 fish between 35 and 39 between our group of 6. I was still disapointed with those numbers as I myself had 9 over 40 in 2002 including 6 in one day on setting net. I have higher expectations for these waters because I know what they are capable of producing. In additon, due to lack of rain (casuing many fire bans in NW ontario) again changed the patterns and location for big fish. THE WATER LEVELS ARE DOWN 3 FEET!!! Instead of the classic patterns we had to find them on deep mid lake humps and wind blown points in about 7-10 feet of water! Normally this time of the year we fish them in 1 to 4 feet! Again, a major change from the norm. Third, the may fly hatch has been going on (again about three weeks early than normal due to early season warm weather) and the walleyes have been a bitting very light over the last two weeks or so. Prior to the last two weeks the fishing has been awesome for numbers and decent for trophies. We have had 3 walleyes over 30 inches and many 24 to 29. As far as pike over 40 we have had about 35 in the first four weeks of the season which is down about half compared to prior years amongst 66 fisherman. Those by many standards are very good but for our waters are somewhat disappointing. With regards to the accomdations our cabins are rustic, but are clean, comforatble, and have good showers and private bathrooms. Our staff makes your bed and sweeps up every day while you are out fishing as well. The cabins are designed with fisherman in mind. They are built by logs from the area. I was wondering if you could explain more of what you meant by ""see thorugh logs"" and ""no celings"". All of our cabins have roofs. We did have one cabin roof leak last week but we fixed as soon as it happened. We have had many families and women stay at our camp and not complain. I guess it depends on the women you are talking about. I hope I did not set your expectations higher with regards to acoomdations. If I did then I am very sorry and normally I explain the accomdations very clearly. Most fisherman say the accomdations are ""adequate"". I agree with your assesment of the portage to fav. and we are exploring new ways to be more proficient at getting people over to the lake. It's comments like yours that make us better and we appreciate the good and the bad comments from our guests. That is why we give every guest a comment sheet before they leave. We will address this for next year no question!!!!! One thing I will disagree with you on is that you do not need to run 45 mins. to get to good fishing on fav. For example some of the best walleye fishing is located just around the point of the launch in the islands and there are many good pike spots within 10 mins. of the launch area. Yes the lake has 25 miles of water so we give you 16 foot boats with 25 horse engines so you can run awhile if you chose to. But it's not mandatory to find great fishing. As far as the boats seats, they do take a beating and some of them start to sag a bit. That is one of the reasons why we provide boat cushions as well so you can prop them on the seat back for better support on your back while you are on the water. To sum up, the fishing has been very very good for much of the time but it has been very strange patterns due to mother nature. I would hope that the staff in camp tried as hard as they could to help you figure out the patterns if you asked them. I did not respond to your post to dispute your claims on the fishing you had but rather to explain what may have affected the fishing you had. I am glad that you did get a 40 incher even though it was only one. I am sorry that you did not experience the fishing that we are accustomed to and expect. I am glad you thought the camp staff was cordial and I am assuming they did as much as they could to make your trip as pleasant as possible. I know this sounds like ""YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN HERE LAST WEEK"" but we do have many guests who would be very suprised by your fishing report and hope some of them can comment on this board. Also, if you do a search on the board you will see other reports that are different from yours. Vitreum, Your post is not factually based. You are entitled to your opinion but when you base opinions on one report of a week of fishing without listening to others or experiencing it yourself is just ignorance. You have been posting on this board almost as long as i have and you should know that fishing is fishing and camps can not contol conditions or nature. When you say ""you pay a lot money for that kind of fishing"" you are wrong. The amount you pay has nothing to do with wheter or not you catch fish. I can't tell you how many times people have told me at camp that they went to NW territories or Manitoba, or sakatchewan and paid double what our cost is and had better fishing at our place. There are many determing factors in cost (and fishing success) but the main one is cost to get there. We are 137 air miles from the nearest road which means all people, food, boats, gas, etc. must be flown in which makes our costs very high. Do you honestly think that our fishing is like this every week when you consider that we are the only ones fishing these four lakes, we are 100% catch and release, and two of the lakes we fish are big bodies of water with major river systems flowing through them? You pay money to have the opportunity to catch fish. We could not stay in business for as long as we have if our fishing was like this all of the time. Even though Idyguy had a tough week during the may fly hatch they still managed one trophy and it seems based on his report that the staff did a good job running the place. We can control the staff but we can't control mother nature. All I am saying is listen to more than just one report before you make a strong determination on the type fishing we have. Tight lines Duffy"
533285,Guest,2003-07-07 11:45:00,0,Here is the link to other reports about the fishing at way north.https://www.walleyecentral.com/dc/dcb...id=25514&page=
533305,Guest,2003-07-07 20:49:00,0,"Duffy I appreciate your reply and the in-depth that you went to in it. This was our first trip to Way North and it was at the end of the May Fly hatch which in my opinion did not bother the fishing to any degree. We fished for northerns with spoons,jigs,buzzbaits and body baits. We fished for walleyes and lake trout with crankbaits, jigs and spoons. I agree the warm temps. affected the fishing but still caught fish in all depths of water but mostly the fish themselves were no deeper than 10 to 15 feet, As far as I know my 40 in. northern and 24 in. walleye were the two biggest of each species caught last week. We did not fly to Setting Net lake due to the poor reports we got from those that did on the efforts. We could not see the extra $400.00 each trip would have cost. We stayed in the housekeeping cabin and the rooms in that cabin have no celings and the walls are made of logs that dod not fit tight together and most women would like to dress in that atmosphere or hear the various male sounds that would be know to everyone in that style of cabin. Granted it was OK for 4 old male fishermen. We were not given any comment sheets as stated by you. We fished the North and South arms of Favourable Lake on the advice of Patrick who appeared to be the head guide. He said fish in the area of the (hole in the wall) in the North arm and the (Severen River) in the South arm. We caught walleye most everwhere we fished in Favourable however they were all (eaters) when the Camp brochure says eaters are had to catch. The boat seats do far more than sag several that we had did a full recline. There is one boat with no seats at all and another that only has one seat and it is for the passenger not the driver. Also when there was a need to transport equipment the two boats at camp were taken and thus no boats for anyone to use. What would they do if every fisherman in camp (at least 20) decided to fish South Trout the same day with only two boats on that lake where the camp is located. The camp is on the wrong lake and should be on Favourable. Why does the brochure say Lemonade and Borland when there are no boats on Lemonade and according to the staff Borland is a waste of time?"
533370,Guest,2003-07-09 13:04:00,0,"Excellent reply. I've never visited your camp, but you sound like a good operator. I believe everything you say because the same thing happend to me at Lac Suel. Over the last 20 years I've fished Lac Suel on both the east and west side of the lake many many times. We always have had excellent walleye and pike fishing. Most days are 100 fish per boat with many days even better than that. We've seen many 28"" plus walleyes and 40"" plus pike. About10 years ago I was approached by an old friend of mine who lives in Tenn for information about a Canadian Fishing Trip. He was trying to arrange a trip for the guys he worked with all of who lived in Tenn. None of these guys had a clue about walleyes or pike, but were all avid bass fisherman. I figured if you can catch a bass you can catch a pike and if you can hold a rod you can catch a walleye. I didn't hesitate to recommed the Ear Falls side of Lac Suel for a mid-June trip and I volunteered to go with them. We all showed up with great anticipation and I told them all about my past ultra-sucessful trips to Lac Suel. From the first morning t lake was absolutly dead. In 6 days the 12 of us didn't boat more than 50 fish of any species. Everyone in that end of the lake reported similar results. The air temps were well above average 80F everyday with bright sun, it was normally windy, and the water was down about 10 feet. The fish were near there normal areas and we graphed them all day, but for some reason they had lockjaw. No matter what we tried it didn't help. Was it weather, low water, bug hatch.........who knows? Six of those guys left two days early and the other guys were ready on Friday, but decided to stay the extra day. I also heard several not so flattering comments about ""The Great Guide"". After they returned to Tenn. I got a phone call from my friend who expressed appreciation for my efforts in taking care of the trip details and arrangements. He told me that most of the other guys thought that the trip sucked and that they would never travel that far again for any kind of Canadian fishing. I'm sure they told all there friends as well. I never did hear from any of those other guys. My friend has returned several times and we have spent those weeks having excellent (NORMAL) fishing in Lac Suel and other lakes. Those of us who know Lac Suel know that that one week was quirk. TGG"
533375,lobo1,2003-07-09 15:48:00,734,We had strange fishing this year ourselves. Never would have thought I would be jigging up pike in 35-40 FOW in late may early june - north of Armstrong. Odd year to say the least. we missed the pike in the shallows by two weeks this year (too warm) and last year the same week we got cancelled due to ice on our lake. Here at home we have had record hatches of mayflies - 4 continuous weeks of huge nightly hatches. talk about putting a damper on fishing. just cant control mother nature lobo
533389,fourize,2003-07-10 07:37:00,287,"As the saying goes, especially related to fishing, ""Timing is everything"". I used to make many trips a year to Pulaski, NY from NJ for salmon. I wish I had a dollar for everytime I was told ""Ya shoulda been here last week!"""
533401,Guest,2003-07-10 20:25:00,0,Duffy Again thanks for your in-depth reply. It shows your desire to honestly answer problems that clients of Way North might have with the camp. I recognize that everyone at the camp but my party were guided and would not try to think we could go into a new camp and outfish the guides. If we could have caught more mid size fish particularly northerns (6 to 14 pounders) we would have been much happier. Those fish eluded us. One of the best memories is Connies fresh baked bread which she kindly gave two loaves to us. Thanks again.
533776,Guest,2003-07-24 10:06:00,0,Does anyone have any current reports from Way North Lodge?
1044913,Guest,2008-07-24 15:07:00,0,"I dont know how the fishing is now but when our group was there 11 years ago,the fishing was fantastic.We were mainly after big Northerns and we really mugged'em.6 guys 6 days C+R 300+Northerns most from 32""-36""our largest 41 1/2(1)--41(3)--40(6)--39(2).We fished Favourable lake everyday except one(the day we fished North Trout).We caught lots of walleye while casting for pike,most were under 21"".Spent a couple evenings fishing South Trout(not as productive).This was the first week of August and one of the best trips ever,always wanted to return but have not been able to.The cabins were o.k. by us,nuthin' fancy but warm & dry.The owners and staff were nice and gave us well marked maps that were a big help as we did not use the guides."
1045518,Guest,2008-07-27 19:39:00,0,"I fished way north and it was absolutely the best trophy northern trip that I've ever been on. Both BIG numbers and BIG fish. We used a guide and he was worth every cent. Couldn't possibly keep track of the numbers, just kept throwin that silver spoon back for more! We caught about a dozen walleye each day just casting from shore as the guide was preparing shore lunch. I recommned way north for what it is, rustic, scenic, remote fish camp with freindly owners, excellent food and outstanding fishing. Set the hook and hold on! JR"

Indy, I just heard from the the group from iowa who was there the same week with you (2 dads with 2 kids) and they said they were averaging 200 to 300 fish per day on when they fished favourable and setting net. They siad they were very impressed with numbers and size of the walleyes and it was the best fishing they had in Canada. Again the big pike were tough to locate that week but they managed a 39 and several between 32 and 38. One of the kids got the 39 inch pike and 26 inch walleye. Please don't take that comment as a judgement on your fishing skill. As i said before, the patterns are awfully strange this year and these guys were guided so the guides had a half of a clue with the patterns based on the weather and conditions. Normally guides are not needed to find and catch fish but this year a guide really helps due to the unusual conditions mentioned previously. With regards to the cabins, you are right, the walls that divide the bedrooms do not go all the way to the cieling but the bedrooms are seperated for limited privacy. Many camps put the beds in one common room! As far as the ""open space"" between the log walls you are right. Some of the logs seperated about an inch over time. If a male wants to peek thorugh the inch seperation to check out a women dressing then we will shoot him immediately!! Just kidding!!! We can and will address this as this is the first complaint we have had about this. Again most fisherman feel that are accomdations are good enough for them. We are not the Hilton but we are clean and comfortable with private three piece bathrooms in each cabin. You should have recieved a comment sheet for your group from Bob and or Connie. I would be glad to e-mail or fax one to you if you did not get it. Setting net does cost $100.00 per person to fly over to and most guests once they go once can't wait to go back a second and third time! I don't know who you spoke to about bad fishing over there but the iowa guys went over twice in four days as they averaged 200 fish per day per boat according to thier reports. At one point one of the dads said his kid counted fish for one hour and he counted 26 fish between the two of them in one hour on setting net! You are 100% correct about the south trout boats and we will address it however last year most people asked for more boats on fav. and setting net because they are our two best lakes and everyone wants to fish them for big pike and walleyes. South trout is our least fished lake. We will have three extra boats on S. Trout next year. Because we fish 4 lakes we need to have boats on all of them. With 20 people max in camp we have to maintain 17 boats, motors, and eqiuptment so every one can fish the lakes they wish on the day they wish. We are not set up to have a full camp fish the same lake on the same day. Vitruem mentioned costs before, well here is a prime example of how it costs us a #### of a lot more overhead than other places. We have 17 boats and motors for 15 to 20 fisherman per week of four differnt lakes!!!. Think of the logistics and staff needed to maintain and portage. As far as the boat seats, we do the best we can to maintain them and if need be we will replace them mid year. Again, we will add 3 more boats next year to south trout. We can not fish lemonade anymore due to the natives in the area. This was found out by us after 10,000 brochures were printed and when I speak to the guests I tell them prior to booking. Borland lake is worth fishing very early in the season only as the walleye spawn there then eventually make their way in Fav. I am sure that's what Clint meant when he said it was not worth going over there when you were there and I am sure they took the boat off of it already. I hope this answers your questions and let me know if you have anymore. Good fishing Duffy > >"
