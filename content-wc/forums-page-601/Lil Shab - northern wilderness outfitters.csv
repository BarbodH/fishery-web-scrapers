I have to say, I've learned more about this trip in 30 minutes here than in countless hours on the rest of the web, this is a great board! Anyway, does anyone have any suggestions for us? This is our first trip with NWO, feedback looks positive from other old posts. Our primary questions are regarding the food package (is it worth it or...?) and any fishing gear/hot spot recomendations. Thanks for any help!"
1044614,joeman79,2008-07-23 12:21:00,417,in my opinion I did not really care for thier food package. The steaks and chops were good but other stuff was just fair. Next time we go with them I am going to bring our own food. I have also heard from others that have been very happy with package. I am picky about my food. A good friend of mine fishes Lil Shab and they do great and catch some real good sized walleye every time they go. Thier Aircraft are AWESOME!! Hope u get Chris for your pilot he is a great guy. Have a great trip. Joe
1044633,boostnut,2008-07-23 13:20:00,9,"Joe, this is exactly the type of information I'm looking for, thanks a bunch! Also, your friend wouldn't happen to have a map with any fishing hot spots marked would he? I'd be happy to revise and resend it to him upon our return with our prefered spots. Thanks again! Aaron"
1044676,joeman79,2008-07-23 15:57:00,417,I will ask him next time I see him. Seems to me one end of lake is really shallow. And They did not do to good on that side of lake. BUt I have read on here that on windy side of any island or point is GREAT. And he said there are lots of islands. One kid in thier group 5 years ago caught a 9 pound Walleye. They don't fish for northerns so can't help u there. If u ever go to Richardson in August I got some great spots that are easy to find. ANd on the food package once again. I would bring about everything they had on thier package but choose the brands and types of and more of some and less of some. And if u like deep fat fried fish you better bring a Big Jug cause we ran out of oil after 2 days for fish cooker. Not because of cooker but because we burnt some of the oil and was just not enough. But pan fried walleye were great too. It was not the kind of fish cooker that I had imagined. Looked like a big wok and oil did not last long. Bring peanut oil. email me and I will give more details of NWO
1044685,boostnut,2008-07-23 16:58:00,9,Sounds great. I'd love to have some additional info. What is your address? If you're not comfortable posting it here you can reach me at [email protected]
1045014,Guest,2008-07-25 04:02:00,0,"I will be leaving for Lil Shab next Saturday, flying out Sunday, returning Friday. I'd be happy to post how we do. This is the second year for us at Shab. We did well last year, lots of numbers but nothing big, 24 incher was the biggest eye. Biggest northern was a 13 lber. Cabin is nice. As far as the food package, we have always taken our own food. We keep it simple and eat lots of fish, taters, beans. Eggs and pancakes for breakfast. We do take some burgers and brats for a change up. And we usually have a steak night to celebrate being there. This is the seventh year our group has used NWO and never a hitch. Excellent planes. Nice cabins. Let me know if you have any questions."
