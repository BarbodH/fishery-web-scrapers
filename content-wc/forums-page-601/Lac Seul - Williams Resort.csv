575873,Wisc-Scott,2008-07-08 15:52:00,1,I have been going up to Ear Falls for the past 5 years. Thinking about a different resort on the lake. I saw Williams resort. Hoping someone could tell me about the resort and section of the lake.
575892,Guest,2008-07-09 09:34:00,0,"Williams is on Williams Lake, not Lac Seul. To access Seul, you need to travel across Williams Lake, down Williams creek and out Williams Bay, which will bring you into the southwest-central part of Lac Seul, about 5 miles NW of Silver Water Wheel Lodge. Depending on your HP, this trek could be 20 minutes or it could be closer to an hour. Once out there however, you're fishing one of the least pressured areas of the lake, with the angler/water square kilometer ratio far below that of the Sioux Lookout, Ear Falls or the West Arm areas.

The camp boats are great. The Outpost has 25hp Yamahas on 16 foot lunds and the main camp boats have 35hp 4 stroke Yamahas on 17 1/2' lunds. As Bum noted, this is a great area of the lake since it doesn't get a lot of pressure. The camp is under new ownership this year and they seem to be working hard to satisfy their patrons. I wouldn't hesistate booking a trip with them. Oh yeh, the price is also pretty good too."

576036,Guest,2008-07-14 18:40:00,0,"We had been going to Williams for the last 5-6 years. Fishing is decent for northerns on Williams Lake, and holds some big walleyes, our personal best is 8lbs. The ride to Lac Seul is about 30-40 min. We always spent all day, including shore lunch. The draw back is that everyone fishes the same areas most of the time, sometimes 2-3 boats on one point. We've seen as many as 8-10 boats in the same general area, as there is a public campground nearby. Fishing is great, 20-50 walleyes a day is pretty common. Hard to get fish under 18in. Cabins are nice, one drawback is that if water levels are low, you will not get thru williams creek it is only about 3ft deep. This happened one year for us. They put smaller boats on the North end of Williams then portage you over to Lac Seul. Make sure you ask about this before booking. If you like long rides and plenty of company, this is your camp. Geat fishing but not a lot of solitude. My personal best on Lac Seul is 29in walleye and 40in Northern. Hope this helps"
