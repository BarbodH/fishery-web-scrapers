1045276,Loup387,2008-07-26 05:26:00,5,"Going to fish Lac Poigan in La Verendrye Park first week of August . We usually go to Lac Andu in the Cabonga Reservoir, where we have had great success with jigs and leeches. Decided to try a different water. Can anyone offer any advice ?"
1045488,hugo giroux,2008-07-27 17:35:00,3,"hi been to that lake, and jigs with minnow gulp will do wonders, dragging worms on bottom will work too. trolling with yo-zuri crystal 3 inch color clown will outfish any crankbait you can try !!!! no bull . I fish in the park often and drive in that park every week because i""m a truckdriver and i've fished those lake many many time. this year the level of the water is pretty high. about 5 or 6 feet above.so fish will be closer to the shore,more than you think. good luck"
1045516,Loup387,2008-07-27 19:24:00,5,Hugo thanks for the advice. I am sure the walleye (dore) fishing should be good at Lac Poigan. Any idea where we can find some pike ? We wanted to go to Lac Saint Amour because the Parc statistics say many fishermen catch pike there but the road to get there seems rather long as we look on the map. Are there other lakes near Lac Poigan that have good pike numbers?
1045709,hugo giroux,2008-07-28 18:16:00,3,"as far as i know,there's a small lake at the entrance of the park called lac coupal ,there a asphalt boat ramp right from the 117 highway.that lake is known for large quantity of small pike.but for larger ones,you should concentrate on larger bodies of water. from where you will be fishing(lac poignan)if you follow the dirt road, insted of turning right to go to poignan,go 10 min furter and you'll end up at the dam of cabonga reservoir..drive across with your boat and trailer and past the 2 camps ,there's a bay on the left side that you can drop the boat..from that bay,go the the left side to malboeuf bay ..i caught nice pikes in that bay...make sure you have a map of cabonga reservoir ...it's a big bodie of water...better wet ,get a gps ...................... tight lines"
