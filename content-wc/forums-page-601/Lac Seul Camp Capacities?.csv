1045179,bpetersen,2008-07-25 16:07:00,251,Just curious if the resorts on Lac Seul have been full or has the gas prices slowed things down? Pete
1045296,thatvoodoothatyoudo,2008-07-26 08:58:00,79,"I was at a resort on the NE side of the lake July 6- 13. The camp was only about 25% capacity. I think the weather had more to do with the low numbers rather than the gas $. best regards, JBP"
1045335,Guest,2008-07-26 13:24:00,0,Why would weather have anything to do with the camp being slow? The trips are usually booked in the winter. I don't think anyone is going to cancel their trip and loose their deposit if they look at the forecast and it is calling for rain.
1045472,Guest,2008-07-27 14:55:00,0,"I would guess our camp near Ear Falls was about 50% capacity as we had our choice of 5 different cabins. Also when we crossed the border at I-Falls on Saturday July 19th at 7:30 am there were only 2 cars ahead of us in line, the crossing took less than 5 minutes."
1045528,Jigger1,2008-07-27 20:33:00,234,I was at Silver Water Wheel Lodge from June 22 - July 1 and the camp was at capacity the entire time. I believe this is a tribute to the way Mike Willems runs his facility regardless of global economic issues. You get what you pay for and SWWL never disappoints.
1045532,prov1900,2008-07-27 20:55:00,544,"As expensive at SWWL is, maybe the economy isn't in such a nose dive after all. Of course I have never been there, so maybe that wasn't fair."
1045882,bpetersen,2008-07-29 11:34:00,251,I was just wondering. I had talked to a few people from various camps. They said their camps weren't full but close to capacity. That was in the NW part of LS 2nd week of June 08. Pete
1045891,prov1900,2008-07-29 11:49:00,544,"Our camp was pretty much the same. Had a couple of earlier ""pull-outs"" due to lost jobs, etc. Other than that, they hadn't totally felt the crunch yet. Wait till next year. How was your trip? Did I provide any worthwhile advice?"
1046043,bpetersen,2008-07-29 22:15:00,251,"Absolutely, the first couple of days were spent just feeling our way around. We did very well at sanctuary mouth, Sawmill, Lunker and Herb's. I was amazed at the number of boats going into Sawmill. It looked like the opening day of a tournament. Spent a couple of days below the power dam. I hadn't fished current much. That was fun when they opened up 3 gates one day. Pete"
1046076,thatvoodoothatyoudo,2008-07-30 06:51:00,79,"I would think that many vacationers check : weather reports and projected radar weather patterns via NOAA or similar , fishing reports, and talk to the resort owners prior to embarking on their trips. Travel plans made months in advance are routinely cancelled with deposit lost due to weather ( Carribean Islands). Better to lose $ 200/pp than spend $ 1500 / pp on a week with consistent 40 k winds, rain predicted every day, record high water levels, very poor (compared to normal) fishing. Of course $6.00/gal gas (in Canada) , $ 16.00/ gal gas at camp not to mention the increased cost of travel on the trip ( 2000 miles for me) also contribute in no small way. - JBP"
