1044290,Guest,2008-07-22 09:02:00,0,"Geez..........It is a lake, fish camp or not. If we take our grandkids up there we will probably pull them around as well. Certainly not where we would bother anyone. Lighten up on Lee Wright, woulda?"
1044697,Guest,2008-07-23 17:46:00,0,"Didn't know I was hard on Wrights, just said there was some tubing going on, to each there own! Some camps are for fishing, some are for watersports and some are able to do both. I've just been told it isn't the old Weavers anymore, that's all, not a slam, just a fact. My husband now would rather go to Lac Seul now anyhow."
1045108,Guest,2008-07-25 10:49:00,0,Sounds like Rump has a big problem that he needs to take care of. Ever think of going to Pysch person??!!!
1045259,Guest,2008-07-25 21:40:00,0,"I have been to Wrights camp every year since they have owned it and have never seen any water skiers ,tubers or Blueberry pickers. I also have not talked to any other guests that have had any complaints. I would have to say Lee, Stephanie and there staff are much to busy running a fishing camp and taking care of there one year old son to have much time for anything else! I might add that I stayed there many times when Weavers owned the camp also, and very much liked Mike and Jerri, but they decided to sell and move on with there life. Sometimes things change, but I would say it is not much different than the way Weavers ran the camp. In a lot of ways I think its even better now."
1043922,Guest,2008-07-20 13:34:00,0,A couple of questions: Do they have organized Blueberry hunts with the Blueberry Fairy? Do they rent fishing boats or just the pontoons? Sounds like a great family camp.
1043931,Moondog,2008-07-20 14:20:00,362,"Better yet, when does the Blueberry Fairy arrive?"
1043937,Guest,2008-07-20 14:47:00,0,I have been to wrights/weavers for over 20 years. do not get where people get this stuff. he does not have jet ski's or pontoons. it is a FISHING camp--and the best one on gullrock to be honest cause of the location to Keg Lake.
1043944,Guest,2008-07-20 15:43:00,0,"I was there when it was Weaver's, and the hosts, facilities, equipment and cabins were all top notch. I always wonder who is picking at this camp and why. I have recommended it many times."
1043991,Moondog,2008-07-20 19:35:00,362,"I, personally, was NOT picking on Wrights AT ALL!!! It is a great camp and even tho we don't stay there (South Bay) we hold Gary in the highest regard. I was serious..........when are the blue berrys going to be ripe!!!"
1044008,tackleman,2008-07-20 20:36:00,444,"It has been so wet up here this summer and with temps way below normal, I doubt that there will be a decent blueberry crop this year.It has rained almost every day and the temps have been 5 to 10 degrees below normal"
1044057,Guest,2008-07-21 07:29:00,0,"Lee told me about the negativity he has got on Walleye Central when I was there last year. He said he thought it was a group from Indiana (?) that he asked to not come back the next year because they were a bunch of idiots. I dont remember what he said they did but im sure it was warranted as Lee and his wife run a first class camp and are the nicest people I know. The cabins are always nice and clean when we arrive, bait is always fresh, and the dock boys are ready to help you out in the morning with whatever you need. Last year we ran short on beer and Lee was happy to lend us a few to fry fish, at no charge of course. I wish you scoundrals from Indiana would get over it and leave Wrights alone. Anyone who has ever been there knows you are blowing smoke."
1044081,Moondog,2008-07-21 08:59:00,362,"Yes, that was about the time that the rumor that he was going to have jet skis available started. We talked to Mary (South Bay) and she said ""no way"" would Lee ever do that. Seems someone is out to get them or at least discredit the way they run their camp. I have had several conversations with Lee and he is a real gentleman."
1044175,Guest,2008-07-21 16:56:00,0,"I don't think it is fair at all to compare Wrights with Weavers, not even a comparison! My husband and his brother were up there the first or second year Wrights had the camp and they took friends out water tubing around the camp, that is not a fishing camp!"
1044270,Guest,2008-07-22 07:06:00,0,"you have got to be kidding me. Where ya from Macy, Indiana?"
