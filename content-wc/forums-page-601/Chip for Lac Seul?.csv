Hve been going up there for 14 years now and know the lake pretty well, however am still navigating via paper map and tired of it. Leaving in a couple weeks and am getting an itchy trigger finger already........Thanks in advance for any help on this."
1045663,Guest,2008-07-28 14:37:00,0,Absolutely go get the Navionics Canada maps chip. Makes finding those humps A LOT easier. This year was my first year using it & it was great. The navionics chip also had some detail not on the commonly available green map. Found a few new spots with it... Jef

Really nice being able to locate them without guessing. The chip I have doen't show all of them, but it did show me one's that I didn't know of. It's worth the money spent to locate the structure not necessary for the navigation. How much is knowledge worth????"
