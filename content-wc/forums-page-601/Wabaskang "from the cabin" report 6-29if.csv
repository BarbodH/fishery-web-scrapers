1044996,Guest,2008-07-24 21:09:00,0,"I'd love to take someoone out on a guide trip if they needed it, however most of the trips I already have either 3 other guys from home or my wife and kids along. It would be tough to tell my buddies to rent a boat for a day since they are waiting all year for a shot at the big ones also! Just follow the team crestliner and don't be afraid to ask me what's going on, I'm not afraid to talk to anyone! ....jka333...I already have too many northern lures but I'd chat with you anyway, especially over a cold one or two up at Jim's some night...just look for the crestliner and give me a shout!"
1045071,jka333,2008-07-25 08:22:00,14,"mike, what area of wabby is jim and julies? we're at gawley's. i know where you hang out for the N's....as we were within shouting distance of each other in '03 when i landed a nice N....and you did at the same time. i'd love to hook up over a brew. as we're out and about we'll watch for the C'liner...and check out jim and julie's if you tell me where it is. thanks for the reports....always fun to read. john"
1045312,Guest,2008-07-26 10:19:00,0,"The resort is located more in the southern part of Wabaskang. One of the nice things about it is its closeness to McCloud Bay and also Keynote. Many people especially ones who don't want to fight the waves on the big lake like to fish those areas which he is close to. try looking at his website for pics of the camp and also recent pics from our trips at wabaskangcamp.com Now I remember meeting you back then, but not sure what boat you've got now, keep in touch"
1045501,Guest,2008-07-27 18:13:00,0,"mike, you're back in iowa. thanks for the reports. i figured out where jim and julies is located. we'll dial you up. going up the 15th -23rd. hope your trip was relaxing jka333/john"
575836,wildernessgum,2008-07-07 07:37:00,19,Thanks for the tips. Wildernessgum
575978,jka333,2008-07-12 10:32:00,14,"mike, we'll be up on the 16th staying at Gawley's in Perrault Falls. Where do you stay when you're up there? You got a Crestliner right? I'd like to try Gawley's Bay and Mcloud Bay this trip up. How long does it take to get to Mcloud from Perrault...via frist narrows.... thanks for the reports. Anyone with coordinates for wabaskang? gl ALL and have a great trip there. john"
575996,Guest,2008-07-13 08:17:00,0,"John, I stay at Jim and Julies (my brother's camp) but have heard alot of nice things about all the camps on the lake so I think you'll be happy at Gawley's too. I don't know what you'll be running for a boat but it doesn't take long to get up to the Big Lake from Gawley's. Probably less than 20 minutes or so even with a rental boat. McCloud Bay might be just a few minutes further for you but that time of year will have alot less fisherman than the Big Lake in my opinion. There are also several underfished areas in the middle lake with all of its islands and points that don't see alot of pressure either. Good luck, I'll have a report from Wabaskang next week as I'll be up next Saturday."
576032,JAY221,2008-07-14 13:59:00,877,"Mike, Just wanted to tell you how much I appreciate these reports! The wife & I will be on the lake the week of August 11th. Later, Jay"
576039,Guest,2008-07-14 19:12:00,0,"Keep your eyes open all of next week for reports...I spoke to Jim today, they've been getting hammered with alot of rain and a really bad lightning storm which has kind of slowed things down. Hopefully by next week things will be in their late-summer patterns with walleyes out on the reefs and northerns working the deep weed edges. We'll see what happens."
1043345,ajbuff,2008-07-17 14:03:00,11,"Big Mike, We got five weeks and a wakeup till Wabby. I assume you'll be there again this year. Great information on the lake, conditions, etc. Very much appreciated. If we don't see you before, see you the end of August. Drive safe!"
1043585,Guest,2008-07-18 14:39:00,0,"Buff, Thanks for the help down in the disaster zone...I'll give you a cold one in August!"
1043665,LAvet,2008-07-18 20:26:00,94,"Thanks for the info Big Mike. Our group goes up in Sept and stay at Pefflleys. I can't wait to get up there and catch fish. Already working on new places to try along with the ""honey holes""."
1044308,wildernessgum,2008-07-22 10:29:00,19,"I spent last week up at Kingfisher on Wabby. The week started off slow with the mayfly hatch ending. We ended up catching a fair number of walleyes for the week but in general the size of fish was real small. Lots of 12-14 inchers. Hard getting fish in the 16-17"" range. My father-in-law did catch a 26"" one that was real nice and fat as well. Endend up doing a lot of fishing on the middle lake as well as McCloud. The weather was nice but maybe not the greatest for fishing. Very little wind, and hot. Rained a little bit one afternoon but nothing to keep us off the lake. Northerns were slow this year compared to previous 2 years that I have been there. Again nothing of size. Couple of 25-26"" fish. One in our group had a real nice fish on (38-40"") with jig and minnow but bite it off. Wildernessgum"
1044732,Guest,2008-07-23 19:57:00,0,"Big Mike just wondering if you would do any guiding while on one of your trips for a day? Sounds like you have them figured out every time your there. let us know, great detailed reports also."
575620,Guest,2008-06-29 22:14:00,0,"Just giving a quick report before I call it a night...just inhaled a pile of walleye and northern fillets with a couple cold coors light bottles..great vacation! The fishing is extremely good right now, the only problem is what to chase after. My buddys from Janesville,IA are absolutley demolishing the smallies. I told them to use topwater propbaits which worked friday night for us but they chose to use buzzbaits and are doing even better, with a 19 3/4 the largest...most caught against the banks either on the beds or close to them. The walleyes are being caught all over the lake, with many being caught in Gawleys, Big Lake, Middle Lake, and McCloud Bay as well. Husband/wife group from Bristow,IA did really well up in McCloud today with spinners and crawlers, releasing two over 21"" and catching over 20 others before noon. I personally have caught a 23"", 2 21"", 2 20"", and several 17-19"" with most of the big ones caught in the weeds on 8 inch musky baits while northern fishing. Now for my favorite, northern. They are really hitting the way I had hoped for. Alot of 24-27"" keepers are slamming the big baits and providing the nightly fish fry for our group. Today my 7 year old got a 39, my wife a 36, 35, and my other son a 35, 34. Obviously trolling is working well as I don't get to reel in anything that is big! Its like a chinese fire drill when a fish gets hooked to see which one of the kids gets to reel it in if the wife doesnt do it first. The weeds are really starting to get green and surprisingly coming up. Alot of the areas I usually catch big northerns in are usually 8-10 feet but are 10-12 now, which makes casting a little tougher to get bites on so were opting for the trolling and its working really well. The biggest in camp so far is a 40 incher caught around 9 pm tonight on a jig/minnow up in Aerobus. Well, got to go get some sleep because that 40 is going to get beat tomorrow! PS...got to meet the owners of Peffley's today we stopped by to buy some snacks that my wife left at the cabin back at Jim's resort. Looks like a nice place and the owners are really nice people...which seems to be the way it is with all the resort owners up here."
575641,wildernessgum,2008-06-30 14:44:00,19,Your reports are the best! Thanks. Can't wait to get up there myself. July 15th can't get here fast enough. Wildernessgum
575692,Guest,2008-07-01 21:45:00,0,"Today was one of the worst lightning/thunder days I've experienced up here. The storms started at 5 am and finally quit around 11 am. After finally seeing the skies look somewhat safe we ventured out around noon. Today was just my wife and sister-in-law Julie, owner of the camp who doesn't get to fish very often watching over the lodge. Well, things are a little slower this week so she was able to slip away for an afternoon with my wife and I. She likes to sling the big baits as well so we chased northern, only afer hitting a point that was hammered all day yesterday with wind for walleyes. Our first pass Julie connected with a 25"" walleye on a spinner/crawler. We ended up catching a 19 and a few 16s and hit the northern. I really thought the storms would turn them off but the result was just the opposite! We had an incredible day. We hit 3 different weed beds and caught several slots in each. Newly developing weeds are definately the key. We caught them both casting and trolling but the most excitement happened when we were trolling. Julie had a 32"" on and my wife reeled in to watch as I got the glove on ready to get the hooks out. I looked at her and asked her why she wasn't casting. She grabbed the pole, casted off to the side, and 3 cranks later...bang! She hooked an absolute beast of a fish, 40 incher with a girth that Ive never seen this time of year! We got it in and took a few pics of both fish and sent them on their way to fight again. Not a bad 18 hours for the wife as last night in McCloud bay she hooked a 39 and a 37 after supper. The walleyes are still scattered in my opinion but easy to catch on spinners/crawlers or spinners/minnows. Anyone with a trip up to one of the fine resorts up here on Wabaskang in the next few weeks is in for some great fishing. It appears that ever dreaded bug hatch has actually occured to a certain extent but I think with the high water levels it isn't bad or going to be bad. I can't wait until tomorrow hopefully the pike are on the tear again, hopefully its my turn for a 40!"
575751,Guest,2008-07-03 21:01:00,0,mike...great reports. i'll be up at gawley's on the 16th of Aug. last trip up I hooked a 37 N just outside the second narrows while your wife and kids sun tanned. I was reeling in...and your kids got one at the same time. i was a little timid...but shoulda givin you a shout out. two weeks after the trip...we connected here..and figured out you was you........and me was me. you goin up around 15 to 22 august? how bout trailer guy? I'll pick berries and fix a screen door! we're doing a wine lake excursion from gawleys....as well as a lost lake trip.
575760,Guest,2008-07-04 07:22:00,0,I'm just curious to why people go back to Wine Lake from Wabaskang. It seems like a long way for a day trip. Is the fishing better there than Wabaskang or is it the adventure?
575799,Guest,2008-07-05 15:38:00,0,I'll be up there again that week as well. Make sure you give me a shout. What were you fishing out of? I think I remember some of the boats that week.
575800,Guest,2008-07-05 15:42:00,0,"I don't think the fishing is any better than Wabaskang, at least not for people that know how to fish Wabaskang after a few years of trial and error. I think part of the draw to it is making the ""trip"" down there and knowing you won't have alot of fishing pressure around you. Also for persons renting camp boats its not that hard of a portage for a few guys. I know if I stayed up at Peffleys I'd probably do it at least once during the week since its alot closer."
575816,wildernessgum,2008-07-06 18:25:00,19,"Hey Big Mike, Going to Wabby for the 3rd time next week. I've never been up to McCloud bay. What areas up there are good spots to try? Wildernessgum"
575825,AB,2008-07-06 22:18:00,61,"Thanks for the updates Mike and glad you got SIL out for some fishing. Aerobus Bay, though often overlooked, has produced some quality sized fish for us through the years. Some very deep water dropoffs there. One year there was a pop-up camper back there right off the bank. Always wondered if there was a logging road and private land along there or someone took it over the ice?"
575827,Guest,2008-07-06 22:52:00,0,"Usually when I fish McCloud Bay I like to fish the two islands and also the rock pile that is marked with a white buoy. I just jig fish around them until I figure out the depth they are at then stay above them. Also don't overlook the weed edges along the east bays as they are full of thick, lush cabbage that hold walleye and norhern. All of the shorline areas up there have potential for good bass as well."
