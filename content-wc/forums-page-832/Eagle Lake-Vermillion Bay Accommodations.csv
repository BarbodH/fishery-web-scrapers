I am going to Lake of the Woods for two weeks but am taking my time going across the north shore of Lake Superior from south of Detroit. I know that one night is tough to do for some resorts but would rather stay there than at hotel/motel. The first night will be stopping in Marathon(if you know a good place there let me know also), then to Eagle Lake/Vermillion area than to Sioux Narrows. Went the north route a couple years ago and really enjoyed the change of pace. Stopped in Thunder Bay first night then to Sioux Narrows, want a little more of a leisurely trip this time. Thanks for all suggestions."

We usually spend an extra night there when we go fishing for a week in July. I agree, much nicer than spending the night in a hotel in International Falls or some place. 1-888-260-4486"
