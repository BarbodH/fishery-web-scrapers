537020,bigfish1965,2004-01-30 06:50:00,3210,Eric..we lost our flag. I've got the original on my computer if you have web space to host it. If not I can host for you or you can just copy the properties for this one.
536973,Guest,2004-01-28 15:05:00,0,Bag all the trash up and hang it in a tree close to your hotspot. That way its easy to get back on them fish. If you buy really good bags they will last for years. Its kind of a poormans GPS system. Dont let me catch you fishing around my bag spots or I will have to have some target practice with my .357 that I keep in my livewell right next to my firecrackers and DUI reciepts.
536976,Guest,2004-01-28 17:21:00,0,I'm a local so we keep a close eye on where the yank pork and beaners camp. We dump all the fish guts about 5 metres in the bush and as LCBO has that American beer on sale all the time we throw cans all over the place and generally leave a huge mess. Them we phone the crimestoppers TIP line and inform the warden of overfishing and littering. Buddy drives a logging truck so he radios me when a new yank crew shows up.

536992,Guest,2004-01-29 04:50:00,0,The best way to get rid of trash after shore lunch? Take off while she's peeing behind the bushes.
536993,Guest,2004-01-29 05:19:00,0,I like that. I would be a lot better off today had I done that with my ex. My good buddy at the time was a good Walleye fisherman who was always improving technique. He showed me a new technique one evening before before Fishing with my ex. In the morning ...you guessed it she was using it. Apparently other techniques were being worked on as well.:o
537001,Guest,2004-01-29 12:03:00,0,"Like a friend of mine used to say...If they can't gut a fish or skin a muskrat, what good are they?"
537012,kelloggs5car,2004-01-29 15:21:00,27,go buy a gallon of minners and catch a 12 lb walleye then cut just the tail off and fry that up with the eyeballs! nearest i figure their ain't no garbage to worry about!
537014,Burr,2004-01-29 16:24:00,8612,"Hey LugNutz, just put the trash and leftover guts n stuff in your pocket. Then when you see a grizz you can walk up to em and feed em by hand. Have your buddy stand back and take pictures. I'll guarentee ya, you'll be one of the only guy's that can say they hand fed a grizz when fishing - and have pictures to prove it! Try it, it usually works really good to mix the guts in with a little left over shore lunch with the drippins n stuff."
537017,Guest,2004-01-29 21:02:00,0,Burr.. sounds like a word from experience?
537018,Hawg Tracker,2004-01-29 21:10:00,261,"""Canada...#1 in being just North of America."" Best thing to do is make sure that the bags are not bio-degradeable. The Canucks don't get good US made bags up there...(LOL)"
536917,Guest,2004-01-27 23:52:00,0,"Whats the best way to get rid of your trash after shore lunch? I like to leave the guts for bear bait. Is it better to leave it on the shore? Do you put it in a trash bag with a big rock and send it to the bottom of the lake for future structure ? Or is it best to just burn it on a dry day> trooling and I hooked some more,,, Will this winter ever end?"
536918,Guest,2004-01-27 23:55:00,0,the few times i have been a party to one the seagulls took care of all the food leftovers right away. the paper and plastic take back with you.
536921,Guest,2004-01-28 05:08:00,0,"Your not serious are you??? Future bottom stucture??? I hope your not teaching your children such things!!! You took it in with you, take it back out too!!!! That IS a no brainer!!!"
536922,Ivy,2004-01-28 06:06:00,556,"He took the bait, hook line and sinker. It's cabin fever I tell you it's cabin fever Ivy "" Ahhhhhhhhh the joy and and calm of fishing. At peace with the world. Wait a minute. I gotta nibble. Yep he's playing with it. Just a couple seconds longer...and...I'm...gonna... set... ....the....hook. NOW!. Son-of-@@$@#$**. Missed him. Why that dirty @#$@#$$%. """
536926,Guest,2004-01-28 09:25:00,0,"Ivy,,, your right,,, and I trolled them boys right in....."
536927,Guest,2004-01-28 09:44:00,0,I like to throw the trash out into the lake and chuck empty beer bottles at it and keep score.
536928,Guest,2004-01-28 09:51:00,0,What are you talking about? Everyone knows you don't sink it to the bottom with rocks you float it on top. Float some bottles with it as well. Then you and your partner race by it in your boat and take pot shots at it with your hand gun. Dump the grease on the grass or rocks. This makes it interesting for the next crew who stop for shore lunch.
536929,Guest,2004-01-28 09:55:00,0,"Everybody knows when your on an Island for shore lunch, you throw the garbage in the dumpster so the garbage man can pick it up,right?If there is no dumpster just let it blow away because it's not your fault."
536961,Big Tim,2004-01-28 13:54:00,63,"Stomp the cans & bring them back with 'ya. Burn the paper & oil(carefull, or you will come back sans eyebrows!--yea- I did). Guts will be gone before you finish fryin' up the good stuff. Gulls ARE good for something!"
536965,Guest,2004-01-28 14:05:00,0,We actually bag up all our trash just to have an arsenal of weapons on hand when someone starts to fish to close. You would be amazed at how fast they move away when the beer bottles and fish guts come flying.
