536147,Guest,2003-12-25 11:29:00,0,I would appreciate any information/opinions that you have about this camp. We are interested but not ready to pull the trigger for this summer. What is the real difference between the VIP and regular cabins? How is the camp staff and the owners as far as service and making sure things go well? And of course how is the fishing!!!!
536154,Guest,2003-12-26 08:15:00,0,"The ownwers and staff are very helpful and professional at Lac seul Outposts. We have been going for 10 years and find the fishing really something you have to experience to believe. The accomodations are excellent,really hard to believe considering you are in the bush (40 mile boat ride to camp). The VIP cabins have their own hot water,refigerators, clean bathroom with showers and inside toilets, stoves and a freezer on the porch. The generator (which you can not hear) runs 24 hours a day. Fishing is superb for walleye and pike with huge musky a possibility. We fish walleye mostly with jig and minnow. You can catch 70-100 a day with some in the 5-7 pound range. I couldn't recommend it higher."
536158,Guest,2003-12-26 14:29:00,0,Fishing for walleyes and northerns is outstanding. VIP cabins are great. Other cabins lack showers and public showers are not that great. Services and workers are just par with other places. I have been to many places in Canada would give the fishing A minus and camp only a C. I would go there again anytime!

536185,Guest,2003-12-28 10:01:00,0,"Made 27 trips there and saw almost all the work and updating being done. It is everything good that has been said above. Owners know what they are doing and do it. Ken and Brenda run a great show and have probably the best location for top notch walleye, northern, and muskie on Lac Seul if not all lakes. Can't go wrong."

536661,Guest,2004-01-16 11:14:00,0,The fishing is great. We had a problem with the camp when they switched us from a regular cabin to a VIP in the middle of the week even though we didn't want one. Then they charged us for it. We now rent a houseboat and enjoy the same fishing.
536689,tly,2004-01-17 22:35:00,1900,"Have had a good trip with them this last year, and have followed their updating of the 'Narrows for awhile. Have been customers from back in early 80's long before the camp aquisition and have always had fair dealings and cooperative people. This year we blew a refrigerator and it was replaced in an instant. The freezers outside the cabin are also nice. No wondering whose group's fish is whos. What we have seen this last year is is excellent fishing and a great staff. There are rules, and must be rules and have seen some previous negative posts but there are generally reasons for everything. If there is a negative, it is that if there is a large group, especially with a TV fishing group there is maybe more attention given to them than the smaller group. That is pretty much univeral but also points out acceptance of the program. WE went VIP and have no firsthand knowledge of the low end. But for sure do not bring any electrical appliance. The generator has a limit, but still 24x7 lights and cooling is a big step above many of the other sites. You should be able to talk to Ken first hand at most any of the shows here in the midwest, he hits many of them. After 20+ years doing business from bait to camp sites to the Narrows we have kept coming back. Wherever you go, enjoy your time. TLY"
