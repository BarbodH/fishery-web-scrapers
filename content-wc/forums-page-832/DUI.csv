536949,Guest,2004-01-28 12:46:00,0,I know this site has beat a dead horse on crossing the border with a DUI but I havent paid much attention till now. We have a new addition to our group going to Minaki and he got a DUI two years ago. Any help with phone number or web sites to get him across without a problem would be greatly appreciated. Thanks
536950,Guest,2004-01-28 13:08:00,0,"He will need to get an application from the Canadian Consolate in Detroit. It takes them about a year and a half to process your request so if it's this summer you plan on going, I would just show up, have him plead his case, and pay the $200. Good chance that they deny him though."
536951,Guest,2004-01-28 13:15:00,0,Oh boy. Here we go again.
536954,BIGEYEJOHN,2004-01-28 13:20:00,95,"how about just saying that you have no criminal offenses? chances are they dont check very often unless you look like they should be searching you. im not sure, will this work? any ideas guys?"
536966,Guest,2004-01-28 14:08:00,0,That'd end up real bad if they check the guy out.
536967,Guest,2004-01-28 14:25:00,0,When they check your drivers lic on their computer you will be hung out like a dryed up carp on the beach. The last thing you want to do at the border is lie to them...it could make a long day and a sad one too. I just tell all my friends with DUI to stay home and play with Momma.
