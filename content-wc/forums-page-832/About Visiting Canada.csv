536746,retire55,2004-01-20 08:54:00,1029,"McQ: Good idea! As well, I have also noted the paucity of information available on Canadian web sites (federal or provincial) regarding alcohol consumption and recreational boating (e.g. fishing). I contacted the Ontario folks about this oversight and was redirected to the Ontario Provincial Police. Contact has been accomplished and I'm awaiting an email with references to the pertinent information. If warranted, I will post to WC for the benefit of all those planning to visit Ontario. Jay"
