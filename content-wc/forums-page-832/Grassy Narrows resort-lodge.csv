Bojangles - was your dad the guy who fell in going into Obabikon? We were there last Oct and one day I saw a guy in the lodge tryin to warm up after falling in. I think he was there with his son and another guy. I think he said you guys continued in and fished for awhile after he fell in. What a trooper."
536975,Guest,2004-01-28 15:50:00,0,yep that was my dad that fell in and yes he is a tropper. he cant wait to return next october.
537008,Guest,2004-01-29 14:49:00,0,See you in Oct. Bojangles. We'll be there from Oct 8-17. Your dad mentioned fishing for crappies near some falls. Mind telling me where he was talking about?
537015,Guest,2004-01-29 17:20:00,0,"i think your talking about the waterfall,this past year with the low water there was not much of a waterfall, its in the northwest part of miles bay i know thats pretty general but without my gps im just going from memory its not what it used to be. ask jerry from grassy he'll be more specfic. hoping to go the same dates as you. look forward to putting a face with the name."
536734,1shooter,2004-01-19 19:18:00,1493,I have an opportunity to go to this resort in June for some walleye/pike fishing. Anyone ever been there and if so is it any good? Any feedback welcome.
536736,Guest,2004-01-19 20:03:00,0,"I've stayed there ten times in the last five years. Don't know what you're used to, but it's a clean, well run boat in lodge with helpful staff and very nice owners. I've never been there in June, but I'm told the walleye fishing is very good then. I've done well in late July and excellent in Oct. on eyes. Never spend much time on pike though. Consider getting Fred the guide the first day or two, and book well in advance. He'll show you where the fish are."
536783,1shooter,2004-01-21 06:58:00,1493,"Thanks for the information. I have been going to Wiley Point for 5 years now and needed a change as we had to travel a fair ways to catch pike. Plus they are kinda of spendy but very nice. What do you use to catch the walleyes? Also, if I want to get a lake map of the Graasy Narrows area what would it be called?"
536784,MTJ,2004-01-21 07:43:00,106,"I assume you are refering to Grassy Narrows Lodge in Morson. If you are the only chart I would use would be the Canadian Hydrographic Service Charts. They can be purchased at the Shopping Centre on your way through Morson. Good luck on your trip. I have heard nothing but good reports from Grassy Narrows. Great scenery and right in the middle of great walley, northern, musky and smallmouth fishing."
536785,Guest,2004-01-21 08:49:00,0,"Use CHS chart no. 6215 for Grassy Narrows and east to Sabaskong Bay or 6214 for Grassy Narrows and west to Little Traverse. You can get them at the lodge or order them online if you want to study the area before you go. Grassy Narrows will be a much different experience then Wiley Point. Much more isolated, access to alot of water, more rustic cabins, and I suspect much less people than you're accustomed to. We use jigs and minnows or bottom bounce plastic worms and small cranks for walleye. There's nice walleye in Miles Bay, just a mile or two from camp, or we go out toward Rubber Island on the east end of Little Traverse and usually do a little better on numbers and size. If you're planning a June trip you should book soon. I think they usually fill up in June quickly. Good luck."
536833,Guest,2004-01-22 00:03:00,0,"I'm sure you will enjoy Grassy, especially if you are an American Plan person. Still seems like a long way to boat out into the lake when you can stay on mainland and have just as good fishing and not pay island prices. Definitely get a guide for a few days if it is your first time in the area. The 6214/6215 maps are all you will ever need."

536844,Guest,2004-01-22 16:18:00,0,It's about a 20 minute ride from the marina to Grassy. I like boat in camps because of the remoteness. Nice to get away from everything for a week. I can't say the fishing is better out there because I haven't fished in Sabaskong. But I do see alot of guides from Morson and Nestor Falls taking their clients out to Miles Bay and points beyond. Grassy has a few housekeeping cabins but they're not available until after July. Strictly American Plan May thru July.
536861,1shooter,2004-01-23 17:50:00,1493,"rockpt, I realize their cabins are a little more rustic and they probably don't have 2 full service bars or a staff of young female college students but, hey my wife is coming along this year. Plus, when you wanted to fish pike you had to travel a fare ways to do so. Also, they are quite a bit cheaper."
536863,Guest,2004-01-23 21:07:00,0,"went there with my father and a buddy last october and had an absolute ball, mostly after crappie and walleye but also caught a couple nice norhterns 10lbs+.its a little rustic and price is a little steep,but it more than makes up it the remoteness,scenery,no long boat rides"
