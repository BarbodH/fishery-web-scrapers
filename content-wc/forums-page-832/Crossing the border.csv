My wife is the best one to take along. Not only does she have a large rectal fissure too, she has had 12 kids."

536931,Guest,2004-01-28 10:05:00,0,"Has anyone ever got checked coming back into the USA? If so, do they actually count your fish? I was hoping to bring back a few extra walleyes and would not want to run into trouble at the border. Does anyone have any good ideas on hiding a a dozen or so extra walleyes?"
536933,Guest,2004-01-28 10:15:00,0,"I usually have each member in our group ""Crotch"" one. With the others we all wear hats and keep them under there. This should help you with your creel."
536935,Guest,2004-01-28 10:56:00,0,"There's lots of hiding spaces. Put some inside the hubcaps, jam a couple in the hollow of the trailer hitch, and they never seem to check inside the fender where I always duct tape a few dozen. The key is to have just the limit in the cooler, which I always show them. That seems to satisfy them and I'm on my way. Funny thing is that by the time I get home I always seem to lose my appetite for fish, cause I've eaten so much up in Canada, and all the fish I smuggle across the border gets fed to the dogs and when they get sick of it, I just throw the rest away."
536947,BD,2004-01-28 12:35:00,739,"I hope your post is an attempt at a joke. Yes people do get checked and fined. The worst part about getting caught is you will never cross the border again, in either direction, without getting torn down. A buddy of mine, traveling in a different car on the same trip, got caught with extra booze that he didn't declare. The booze was confiscated and because of him we had to wait for two hours in Fort Francis while he put everything back into his truck and boat. He got checked every time he crossed the border from then on and got so sick of it he stopped going. He had even asked the border guard, five years after the fact on the last trip he took, why they were still tearing him down. He had learned his lesson. They didn't answer, just tore him down again. By the way, the border stations must share info because he also got checked coming back from then on."
536948,bigfish1965,2004-01-28 12:36:00,3210,"I would actually catch a limit of nice big muskies. Then, after gutting them, you can fill the carcasses of the musky with walleye fillets. When you get home, take out the fillets, then bury the musky in the garden. Fertilizer is about all they're good for. If you get caught, simply state that the musky obviously had just eaten a few walleye before you caught it."
536956,Guest,2004-01-28 13:26:00,0,ha-ha...too bad...so sad ....
536960,Guest,2004-01-28 13:52:00,0,Some one is trolling for suckers here. You might get a few to rise to the bait. But keep in mind that some of the lurkers that read these posts might actually believe or worse share with the Peta type mindset. So I posted here in now to clarify that this is just boredom of some original poster to see how many patriotic Canadians or catch and release types will take offence. So all just in fun as winter drags on.

536970,Guest,2004-01-28 14:53:00,0,We always smuggle out 30 or 40 extra Walleye. We only take the ones that are over ten lbs. Last year we drowned one of the guys we didnt like and put all the fillets under him in the coffin. Worked out good but his wife and girlfriend complained that he smelled like fish at the funeral.
