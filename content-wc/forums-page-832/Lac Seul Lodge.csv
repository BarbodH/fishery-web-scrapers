This is our 1st trip to this part of the lake so I'm looking for any input on the fishing, accomodations, water hazards ect. to help our family to have a safe, fun trip. Would GPS be helpful in this area of Lac Seul? Thank You. Lunker 12"

Hope you and yours have a trip of a lifetime. Make sure to take a picture of the big girls and set them free to be caught again. Jigger1"

There is good fishing near the camp and they will supply maps that will put on some good spots in the bays that are close to the cabin. I would not venture out into the main lake unless you have somebody with you that is experienced about where to go to fish."

536841,Guest,2004-01-22 14:44:00,0,have stayed thereand it is very nice. the only problem might be the low water if it is still low. going out to the main lake is a sand bar to cross and if its low i dont know if you can make it. good lluck
536842,Guest,2004-01-22 14:55:00,0,There are two routes form the lodge to the main lake. Last year when the water was low in June we had no problem getting out to the main lake. dan the Lodge Owner takes great care of his people and he will have access to the main lake.

Catch and Release the Big Ones so somebody else has a chance to catch there DREAM FISH."
