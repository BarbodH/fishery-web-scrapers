536895,Guest,2004-01-27 05:29:00,0,Would anyone be familiar with either of these lakes in Ontario? Any information would be appreciated....wondering if there is much traffic or if they are quiet lakes. Thank you...pete
536915,Guest,2004-01-27 18:07:00,0,"If the Route Lake you refer to is in northwest Ontario, I am familir with it. The lake is pretty quite, only one resort, perhaps 4 - 5 cabins and little local fishing activity. Fished it for several years before we moved on to different pastures, so to speak...cheers..

We have always fished northern Minnesota where we own some lakeshore property, but I'd like to find a quiet place in Canada to get away from it all and especially after we retire to spend more time while we are able. I had the chance to spend some time at a friend's water access cabin on the Woman River chain north of Ear Falls last summer.....I got hooked! Do you remember how the fishing was on Grey Trout? It's not that important, but just curious. Thanks and appreciate any other information you might think is important.....pete"

Fished Route for about three years and then moved on because I found the lake not to be that much better than what I could have in Northern WI. There are lots of lakes around there that were pretty good, but you had to portage a boat or drive to those others. If I am going to drive that far beyond northern WI or MN, I want the fishing to consistently be better than the lakes I pass. Route is a very pretty lake and we had some pretty good days. However, as a rule, the walleyes were pretty much under 20 inches and the pike were small too. Never fished for the trout in the lake and only caught a couple by accident fishing for walleyes. Perhaps I and the guys I go with are just poor fisherman, but we do really well at Lac Seul (last year our biggest Lac Seul walleyes was an honest 10 pounder, with a 19 inch bass, and a 39 inch pike). LS is a much bigger body of water and you need a bigger boat than you would on a smaller body like Route. To each their own so to speak."
