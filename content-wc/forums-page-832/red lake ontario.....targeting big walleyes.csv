This will be the second year I will be going to Red Lake in Ontario; last year we caught alot of fish in the 17""to 20"" range in shallow water on lindy rigs. We also caught about 10 or so that were 22"" to 27"". Maybe I'm wrong but I think if I knew where and how to target bigger fish we could be more successful. If anyone has any info. that will help, especially if you've fished red lake, please respond. We will be going from June 5th to the 12th and I've heard that the bigger wish could be moving out to deeper water. If so what are some strategies to fishing deeper water. I've heard a little about trolling crankbaits but don't know how to rig w/ a planer board or anything. Also what should I be looking for as far as water depth and structure on my electronics?"

When I say shallow, some days as little as 3 feet. However, generally we fish 7 - 10 feet on windy points, sand flats and emergent weed. Some years the fish have been deeper, but the general rule for Lac Seul is shallow until mid-June then deeper. Not sure if its the same for Red Lake, but I would try pitching jigs and dragging spinners in 7 - 10 feet, occisonaally tossing a crank at the bank until that is proven wrong. In terms of color, jigs nothing beat pink head and white body, and in spinners, either gold or chautreuse in pretty hard to beat. Last year my son took a 30 1/4 inch walleye from about five feet casting a crankbait on a sand flat...cheers and good luck...IA Walleye"
