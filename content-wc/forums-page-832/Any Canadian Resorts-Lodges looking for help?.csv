Have reached a point in my life where I could take some time, and do something a really enjoy for awhile. If anyone knows of a Resort/Lodge looking for some FT/PT help this spring/summer, let me know! I'd love to head up there for a few months this coming summer and guide, clean fish, mow, ect. You'd have a hard time finding anyone who would be happier than I to do such tasks! Thank You! Ryan[email protected]"

536916,Guest,2004-01-27 20:59:00,0,"HEY, why not guide down there ? Why come up here & take work away from a citizen of Canada ? I guide up here & I can tell you that there sometimes isn't enough work for all of us. I can't come down to your country to work, so why should you be allowed to work in my country ?"
536919,Guest,2004-01-28 03:00:00,0,come on down ! stay awhile ! and if ya vote for me I'll make you and 8 million of your cousins US citizens - but ya gotta vote for me. Bush in 04. what a bunch of crap
