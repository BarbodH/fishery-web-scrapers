Advertisers pay for putting their name up so others can view their particular products/services, the fees they pay gives them that right. It has become increasingly popular for some posters to include the name of their products, services, and company avitar into their signature that they display when posting. Some would call that advertising, and in the true sense of the word it is. We feel that advertisers that have paid to put their names here aren't getting full value for their dollar if we let others put their names here for free. So, in turn, we would ask that if you include a product/service name in your signature, please remove it. If you work for a company that makes a produce, or provides a service that would relate to the folks here on Walleye Central, we would welcome your advertising dollar, and in turn, be glad to put your name on top of the web pages that we all see when visiting here. We thank you for your cooperation."
