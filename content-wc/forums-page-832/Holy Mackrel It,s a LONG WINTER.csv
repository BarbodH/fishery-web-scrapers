Just last weekend sorted,washed and rearranged all my tackle and used up a spool of 1000 yards of Power Pro on my reels. My wife got a little upset because I repacked for the third time my clothes for my June Canada trip. I plan on spending this weekend waxing my boat and replacing the carpet if I have time after that Im going to the tackle shop because I dont want anybody to have something that I dont have. Thank God that the wife paid off the credit card last week so I wont have any problem buying the ""New Hot Lures"". That sun better start shining soon so I can sit out on the dock and listen for the ice to start cracking....ahh the sound of Spring. Sorry got to run. Need to start searching Outfitter websites that I may have to order brochures from in case I can sneak away to Canada later in the summer or maybe the fall. HELP"

Is it weired if you practice with your new baitcaster working hookless reef runner across your frozen snow covered yard? My neighbors think so!"
