536962,Guest,2004-01-28 13:57:00,0,Why all the fuss about how to clean a 12lb Walleye? Somebody could do me a big favor and tell me HOW TO CATCH A 12lb WALLEYE. If I did catch one I would probably kill it with the flashs from my camera.
536969,Guest,2004-01-28 14:49:00,0,Best way is with a square hook. I set the net in the Prime spawning areas and only do it at night. We have night vision equipment and get dropped off. I sell the fish to taxidermists who in turn sell to Lodges who in turn provide them to special guests. I only keep the really big ones..about 70 or 80 a year and throw the rest back.
536971,Guest,2004-01-28 14:57:00,0,Send me a list of those lodge Owners. Ill get me one of thse big girls for sure.

536698,Guest,2004-01-18 11:18:00,0,"For yers and yeers , we have dun tried all kins of wayz to fillay lots and lotes of huge fish of many tyopes - wallies 10 pounds and up, muskees 50""-55"", rainbow trowt up to 30"", broke trowt as big as 6 pounds, and even big basses up to 8-9 pounds. The sawzall works good if you got lectrisity but cuz ours aint cordless. The chainsaw works ok unless aint aloud in fussy parks or forests or it just don't run. Choppin froze fish into stakes works ok if it's cold enuff but then i aint fishin. The lectric knife is for sissees. blender works good but gotta chunk them first and it leavs a ""aftertayst"" in the margereetas. The band saw is slow but werks less the spyne and rib bonezs are two thick, then we use a radeeal harm saw to cut stakes. As we get old and drink alot more, after catchun all them trofee size fish, it is just too much werk to tote them back to the house, let alone chop them up. So anymore we just thow em up on the bank for the coons or bears to eat. a few tymes we have thowed em in thu salvashen armey box as u donashun. mebbe this ideuz will hep yuu to with yer fihs. dont no wyyy , but at meny of our favrite fishin holz the numbers of fish just aint lik back then. Dunno wyyy. Eny ideuz? Sints ainte somany fish ,this spring can I go fishin with you at yoor best holz.? Please email me at [email protected] Tite lines, Jes Kiddin"
536702,Guest,2004-01-18 12:32:00,0,Don't I know you from somewhere...I got a pain when I read your post...
536704,Guest,2004-01-18 14:45:00,0,Hey Jess Kiddin....See you at the family reunion. I still cant believe the day my sister married you.
536727,bigfish1965,2004-01-19 15:20:00,3210,Okay now someone go over to the musky board and ask what kind of bat is better for whackin muskies over the head with...ash or aluminum... ;)
536732,Reels,2004-01-19 17:59:00,2876,"LOL too funny- better yet, ask them their favorite batter for frying up the muskies! <{{}}><"
536883,Guest,2004-01-26 07:33:00,0,Mostly you guys need to lighten up.
536899,Guest,2004-01-27 08:54:00,0,I just posted on the Muskie board to get a rise out of those boys. All in good fun boyz!!! I am the Fishin' Magician.
536906,Guest,2004-01-27 13:21:00,0,Supost to put the bigin one back Just a damm fisherman
536930,Guest,2004-01-28 09:57:00,0,Everyone knows your not supposed to eat those big eyes. Bust them over the head with an oar and throw them back in and watch the sea gulls fight over them. Those big fish eat up all of the bait fish and don't leave anything for the smaller ones!
536506,bigfish1965,2004-01-12 16:42:00,3210,Okay guys... Each winter (or more often) this post gets put up. It's A JOKE!! We all play along and have fun.A little something to fritter away the cabin fever.
536533,Guest,2004-01-13 11:05:00,0,"We usually get a 2 or 3 dozen 10lb+ each April spearing before ice-out. We freeze solid, then use a bandsaw and steak cut them in 1/2 inch steaks. You can just knock out the frozen entrails and dead spawn/eggs and discard. Peel off the skin and you have a nice batch of walleye steaks. We either use the walleye straks for catfish bait later in Summer or eat them fried or poached. We prefer loon stock over chicken stock for the poaching solution. The wife and kids enjoy making and boiling up loon and owl stock. ;)"
536537,Reels,2004-01-13 13:35:00,2876,"We like to hollow them out, and stuff them with beef to smuggle over the boarder. <{{}}><"

536566,Guest,2004-01-14 04:41:00,0,"My Dad told me this years ago whenever I would catch big carp. First you take a 3/4 inch pine board the same length as your fillet. Next you smear a whole stick of butter on one side of the board,next you put plenty of salt and pepper on the butter and any other spices you like, now you place the fillet on the board and bake in oven at 350 degrees for 2 hours, then take it out ,throw the fish away and eat the board. Ps Watch for splinters!!!!!!!!!!!! Ha HA LOL"

536624,Guest,2004-01-15 11:36:00,0,dump it back in. my rule of thumb is that the bigger the fish the gamier it tastes. they get slow-sluggish-their metabolism slows. the worse thing on the east coast is a summertime 15 pound bluefish. the little snappers are tolerable but dont waste you time on big fish to eat. save the trophies for the digital cameras!
536627,Guest,2004-01-15 11:49:00,0,ROTFLMAO! Good REELS!!
536628,Guest,2004-01-15 11:53:00,0,"You should be warned there is a certain amount of sarcasm involved in many posts in this venue, Walleyechieftain. This place is not the best place for anyonewho can be easily trolled."
536629,downriverbob,2004-01-15 11:58:00,880,I'm glad to see the same recycled posts year after year !
536464,Guest,2004-01-10 23:48:00,0,"Just wondern whats the best way to fillet a big walleye. Is the cheek meat that good? My buddy, Dick Withem can put on a great fillet show so trying to teach him a good method for big eyes"
536470,River_eye,2004-01-11 10:39:00,1486,"I just put'em through the grinder, head and all, and eat fish burgers for two months straight."
536473,retire55,2004-01-11 11:47:00,1029,LugNutz: You must really be looking forward to enjoying the supurb flavour of walleye that size - the PCBs in big walleye really enhance the flavour - apparently considered a real delicacy in some parts.
536474,Guest,2004-01-11 12:45:00,0,"Any fish that size we smoke. The chemicals and PCBs, mercury go to the outside of the skin and we remove the skin before eating. There are times when we get way too many of them and then I sell them to the commercial guy down the street. He exports them to high class US restaurants. I've also heard that if you remove the skin, dry it and grind it up and put it in little bags that there is a huge US market for it. Apparently it is a natural exfolient. Only fish over 10lbs have this though and you have to be aware of imitations."
536476,fishmaster,2004-01-11 13:01:00,209,Why would you not want to release a fish that size and let someone else catch it another day? CPR and they will grow to be bigger and maybe the next record fish some day.
536479,Guest,2004-01-11 17:50:00,0,"I've found that the average electric filleting knife just won't hold up on those old 10+ girls. Luckly I found some 12"" metal blades for my sawzall, now the job goes a lot quicker, and a 1 1/2"" hole saw in your drill rips the cheeks right out, they're just like scallops. Also when faced with one of those nasty old 50+ Muskies, I've found that an electric chainsaw (with vegtable oil in the oil tank) chunks them right up for chowder! :)"
536480,MN_Moose,2004-01-11 18:20:00,965,This is an annual occurance. Posting such a topic to get a few bites. Pay no attention. This person has never seen a 10lb walleye let alone catch one. He has gotten all the attention he deserves.
536481,Guest,2004-01-11 18:48:00,0,nice about cacthing a 13 lbs eye in canada is you must be the 1st person in a long while
536484,bigfish1965,2004-01-11 19:31:00,3210,"I find that the best way to cook up these BIG babies is the same way we cook up Bald Eagles.Make them into a chowder! Yummy!. Musky tastes awesome this way too, but only the 50 plus inchers. The puny ones don't have the right texture. I bet we cooked 50 of them before we figured that out!! Stupid us!"
536500,fishmaster,2004-01-12 14:58:00,209,MN_Moose Yea you are probably right they have not seen a walleye like that in a life time. Too bad someone has to start something like this to get a bunch of us all worked up
