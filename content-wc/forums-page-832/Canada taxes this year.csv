I think last year, didn't they eliminate one of these taxes? Was that permanent or just for last year? And, whichever one is refundable, is the whole thing refudable or just a percentage of it? Thanks."

If you stop, you get Canadian cash back. If you mail in, you get a cheque in US funds. PST (Provincial Sales Tax) is 5% and will be collected this year. This tax was left off accomodations until September of last year to try and help combat worries abour the sars thing. The GST refund is nice, you can pick up a bottle or a gift for the kids or wife on the way home if they aren't with."
