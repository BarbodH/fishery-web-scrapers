After about two fish they need sharpened, and I also think the hook up ratio is poor. I have been looking for a gamakatsu or diachi to replace them. Anyone know if those two companies make a long shank aberdeen style of hook? I have checked my go too places like gander, cabelas, and lure parts online with no luck."

1249479,manitobawalleye,2010-11-16 10:19:00,885,I have been using these.....very sharp and you can find the right length....http://www.mustad.no/catalog/asia/product.php?id=32 here is a source....http://www.tacklewarehouse.com/Musta...ge-MUPDBF.html

1249501,Pezman38,2010-11-16 11:48:00,3196,What size do you use?
1249679,manitobawalleye,2010-11-17 04:38:00,885,"Size #4....but it would depend more on what size of minnows you use and how you hook them. We use a lot of salted shiners up here. They go thru the eyes and out the back. Live... go in the mouth, out the gill and thru the back. I have seen them on the shelf at Cabela's Grand Forks, if you are near one."
1249702,Pezman38,2010-11-17 07:08:00,3196,"I hook minnows the same way you do, thru the gill and up the back, size 4 should be fine then. Closest cabelas and bass pro is 2 hours. 90% of the time my fishing products come right to my door, if bass pro and cabelas didn't charge 20 bucks for shipping each time they would get more business."
