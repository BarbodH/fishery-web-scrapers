They deviated from their original schedule and arrived a night early, they called and asked if it was ok and Tracy Boois said ""Sure, we'll work something out"". Everything went great until checkout time when they were settling up the bill. The Boois' charged them for the whole day of the night they arrived early (something like $240... each!). When the bill was questioned and protested, Tracy's answer was ""We're a seasonal business and we're out to make all the money we can during that season"". Just something to keep in mind."

May not be a good lake for a first Canadian trip. Just a thought as I don't know your situation.Green Air in Red Lake also has a camp on Trout and several other lakes in the area.Booi's appears to be a nice place. I know a young couple who worked and met at Booi's and later married. They ran a camp for Green's up on Birch lake for several years. Very nice kids. We still keep in touch.I think Booi's has a good reputation and is located on an island. Cabins look above average and fishing is known to be pretty good, but with the big water you may have to hunt fish.Pooch"

1250926,Pete eer,2010-11-22 14:08:00,14,"I have not been to Booi's on Trout but I have been to Sandy Beach Lodge on Trout Lake two times. Trout Lake is huge and can get very rough but the fishing is great. Last September my wife and I averaged over 60 fish per day and it was tough finding fish below the slot limit for shore lunch. We fished with a guide which I would recommend if you are not familiar with the lake. Sandy Beach Lodge has nice cabins, great food and an experienced guide staff."
1250952,gary2242,2010-11-22 15:54:00,49,"I've been to Boois. It was awesome. Their rates are a great deal considering the level of accommodations, fantastic fishing boats and awesome fishing. Tracy and Jim are just the nicest people you will ever meet and they make you feel like you are an old friend. The whole lodge has this adventure energy that I can't describe but it was one of my most memorable vacations. I plan on going back with my brother when he retires next year. About the comment of Tracy charging for an extra day; I don't know of any hotel, motel or lodge on Earth that is going to give you a free day of fishing, a free meal and a free night's sleep because your taxi screwed up. I think the fact that Tracy had to re-schedule the rooms and the kitchen and juggle a bunch of other issues to accommodate them should be noted."
1251235,MidWestFishman,2010-11-23 15:37:00,44,"I might be misreading but it seemed like he said they arrived a ""night"" early which I take to mean no fishing, probably did have a meal I would suppose. If he was charged a whole day as if he fished and ate 3 meals but didn't, I can see where that might raise a question or two but then he also should have asked the charge for being early (if he didn't) so there would be no surprise.I know where I am scheduled next year at Hawk Lake Lodge they tell you right on the website that the rooms won't be ready until 2 PM so don't come in early or you will incur extra charges, of $45/hour. Since I am driving and will be there around noon, the owner, Ted Putnam who is a super guy, said he would let me go ahead and take a boat out on my own for a couple hours until the room was ready with no extra charges and I could go out after supper. That may not be the norm at most lodges but just thought I would chime in on how another lodge handles a similar situation. At the end of the day it is the responsibility of the fisherman to clarify such things so everyone is on the same page and it is a win-win for both fisherman and lodge owner."
1251271,Golden Eagle,2010-11-23 16:50:00,2642,"One party flying in to camp and none coming out, means extra flying costs for the camp owner. Probably blew aprx $500-$600 on air travel for their party, depending upon the type of aircraft and size of the party."
