Even though those fish may swim off, many have been stressed so much by living in the well for better part of a day they will morew than likely die within 24 hrs."
1248955,KTroller,2010-11-14 09:01:00,237,"Scott, bring whichever boat is most comfortable for fishing. There may be some places you can't go with the big one but you'll get in and around camp and most anywhere you want. Timberlane is putting in a new ramp which may work otherwise the one a mile down the road will.KT"

1251650,Jim6buck,2010-11-25 07:42:00,4,I hauled my 24ft Deck boat up this summer and it worked great. We had 4 fisherman and we had plenty of room to move around. The deck of my boat sits about one foot off the water and has a open front deck and rear deck so it was very easy to fish from. It looks like a pontoon so everyone made fun of us. But with a 150 horse motor we could get any were on the lake. Putting up the canopy on hot day jigging for walleyes made it all worth it!
1245905,scgibby11,2010-10-31 07:51:00,109,"Hi all. I posted this first in the wrong section. Here is my question to you Canadian Lac Seul experts:I'm looking to plan what type of boat to take on a trip next summer with my family of 5 for walleyes.We are going in Mid July and staying near Ear Falls. Here are the choices:1. 24 foot seaswirl striper with twin 4 stroke outboards. The boat has a livewell, trolls nicely, plenty of room to fish. It handles rough weather fine, lots of rod holders, and has good electronics. I do not have an electric trolling motor on it, so for jigging and casting it will be anchored. It also is a lot of weight to tow from Michigan.2. 21 foot boat that has a nice electric trolling motor on it for boat positioning and trolling. It is much lighter to tow. However, it is really a ski boat without any fishing paraphernalia except a GPS/sounder.If anyone knows the Ear Falls area, let me know which you would bring.Is the ramp at Ear Falls able to handle the bigger boat?What about topography in that part of Lac Seul (shallow? rough? narrow channels? etc.) Thanks,Scott"
1245914,wallydave,2010-10-31 08:23:00,2151,"I do not pretend to be an expert, but I am pretty sure that Lac Seul does not allow for live wells to be used. Your catch on your boat has to be dead. I have always gone for the boat upgrade at Goose Bay, 17 ft Lunds can fish 4 people. Where near Ear Falls are you staying?"
1245929,bigtimeelectric,2010-10-31 09:19:00,174,take the 24 footer. you need all the bells and whistles. fishing out of a ski boat is for the birds. I have a 20' pro v and there has been plenty of days out there I wish I had a bigger rig. Sometimes you might need to run down to mckenzie bay to really get in the good fishing which is aproximately 20 miles. and when you are fishing the sand banks and the wind decides to pick up to 25mph out of the west you are in for a long ride home. I have busted waves for some smaller boats in that situation before. anyway bring the 24 you will be happy you did.....go vikings!!!!!!
1245941,JDP,2010-10-31 10:55:00,1457,"Bring the 24 footer or use an upgraded camp boat if you decide not to tow.The 24 footer will provide much safety and security as you boat down the lake to McKenzie Bay, etc. (Seems like a lot of Ear Falls resort clients do this). You will have a lot of fun checking out the main lake!Livewells cannot be used for keeping caught fish alive ---bait only."
1245953,bigtimeelectric,2010-10-31 12:59:00,174,also I fill my livewell full of ice in the morning and we throw our kill fish in there that makes it nice and easy to clean out in the evening by flushing with water...
1245956,gregk9,2010-10-31 13:10:00,625,Why is this? Seems weird to me....
1245960,adempsey,2010-10-31 13:41:00,963,"I found this odd too, but it's in the regulations.I assume it's to prevent culling of fish."
1246040,scgibby11,2010-10-31 19:57:00,109,"Thanks for the replies. Keep 'em coming if others have thoughts. 1. We are staying at Timberlane lodge (someone above asked)2. I am 90% certain we'll take the big boat. I agree with all that has been said. My only hesitation is knowing whether it can get in the ramp and if there are narrow/shallow inlets/channels needed to get to the lodge. I also will miss not having an electric trolling motor, but the pluses probably outweigh those negatives.I ordered a chart of the Northwest part of Lac Seul, but it hasn't arrived yet.As for the livewell--we will plan to use it just for bait (or possibly as a glorified cooler as you point out!)Scott"
1246056,wallydave,2010-10-31 20:45:00,2151,"I know you will always here big stories around the dock or fish cleaning house, so how about a few more! My boat/cabin buddy tried to go to Macenzie Bay with a 16ft camp boat and a 20 horse motor, getting there was one thing, getting back into a strong wind was a whole nother story!! White knuckle time! Another story was a couple of guys in 14ft jon boat they brought from home, got blown down the lake and took a couple of days to wait for the winds to let up! Now that Goose bay has upgrade boats, I feel better about the windy days that used to keep us in the cabin, or at least close to camp! Another thing to consider about Lac Seul, the water levels can change from year to year. My last trip two years ago, the water had never been higher, some years when it's low, you will need to go easy."
1246115,skindzier,2010-11-01 07:25:00,137,"I'll chime in with my .02... IF the 21 footer is a deep V, I would at least consider it, as I really depend on my electric trolling motor when I'm up there - makes fishing the reefs much easier. As others have said, it can get nasty coming back from the sandbanks - I've whitenuckled it back a few times in my 17'er. That said, in a 21 (again if it is a deep V), you'll be better off than 90% of the folks out there. Good chance we may see you up there - we've stayed with Wendy & Vance the last 3 years & love it. Haven't booked for next year yet, but will do so right around the first of the year & mid-July is when we usually go. If the water level is low, the bigger boat might be a bit exciting in Shanty Narrows, but you should be fine if you follow the lines - just don't stray from them! As far as boat ramp goes, you'll definitely want to use the Gold Pines ramp rather than the one in camp (although Wendy & Vance are talking about improving the one in camp). The Gold Pines ramp drops off enough that I don't think you'd have an issue with depth, but it is a bit uneven, so you'll have to work a bit harder to get the boat on level. Now that I think about it, the ramp is a bit narrow too - might want to talk to Wendy & Vance to find out exactly how wide it is. Jef"
