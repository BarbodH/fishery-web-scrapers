After talking to eddie, telling him what our group was looking for, i booked. He is wants to make sure that all guests have a good time. I have been to camps where they take your money and say go have at it. He is in camp all week with us, which on a fly in is like having a guide right there. Looking forward to a great week in a beautiful area."
