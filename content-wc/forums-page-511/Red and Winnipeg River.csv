1248737,LeeMB,2010-11-12 19:02:00,83,Winnipeg river is still producing. Red is slow. The only fish being caught are very shallow in the Red.
1248738,mrwalleye5,2010-11-12 19:03:00,1922,"I have been fishing the Pine Falls Area ( Winnipeg River and Travers Bay) since mid September. Had one bad day out of the nine trips and that day we still boated 10 walleye. 40 to 50 fish per day per boat in common.Lots of chunky 3 to 5 pounders ( 18 to 22"") and 6,7,8 pounders ( 22 to 27"") coming frequently. Largest for me so far is 30"". Heading up tommorrow for the tenth and last time, but that is what I said two trips ago. As for the Red I couldn't tell you. I just can't bring myself to fish that river even though I pass over it every time I go to Pine Falls."

Most were over 21"" and released..... mainly used a Len Thompson spoon jigged vertically in 15 1/2ft of water out in Traverse Bay north west of Robinsons Rocks..... (size 00, orange and gold tipped with a saleted minnow).....fish absolutely HAMMERED it when they took it, nothing subtle about the bite on the spoon! Hoping to get out again, but forecast for the end of this week isn't too promising (as long as the launch is useable, I will be out.....)"
1249130,Manitou,2010-11-14 21:36:00,125,Wow that sounds like a great time.I'm hoping to get out on LOTW one more time before freeze-up.
