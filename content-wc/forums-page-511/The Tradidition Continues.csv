We are headed to Witch Bay for a few day over Memorial Day Weekend, my fifth trip to Witch Bay."

My 1st trip to NW Ontario was 1978 and I've only missed a few years since then, always going the 1st week of the season or the week of Memorial Day. My son, whose birthday is in May, went for the 1st time in 1982 when he was 16 (my birthday present to him). He was able to make it about every other year until eight years ago when he started to teach middle school math and is still in school when my group goes north. Since I retired five years ago, he and I do a mid- or late August trip each year. You can't put a price on that week together! You and your son will create a whole new set of memories and stories that will enrich you both. Enjoy!"

I have been blessed to be able to take my boys annually to the wonderful Canadian Wilderness. It has become a special part of our lives. Below is a picture of my youngest from earlier this year. He caught this pike when we were bobber fishing with ultra light tackle and a slip bobber for perch. He is a happy camper and very proud. Please enjoy and cherish every moment. Have a GREAT trip.https://www.walleyecentral.com/forums...824227&thumb=1Thank you,Larry Mac"

We were dropped off on pristine lake with two rafts and picked up 70 miles down river. We caught 8 species of trout, salmon. My sons 14, 16 year olds were exposed to real wilderness. One highlight was 16 year old taking a photo of mother griz with 3 cubs."
