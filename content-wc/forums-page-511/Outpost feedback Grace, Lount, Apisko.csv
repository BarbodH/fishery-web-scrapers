I have not fished at any of them before. Grace seems like it is on the small side so I am really interested in communicating with someone who has spent some time there. We like to catch 20""+ walleyes, with a shot at a 30 and big northern pike. I'm looking forward to hearing from any fellow walleye centralites so if you know anyhing about any of these lakes, please respond. Good fishing to all! lassh"

I have stayed at gawleys main camp and they know how to run a camp and how too treat their customers I can assure you! also I have been to fly inns on smaller lakes such as this and I really enjoyed it cause of the wind, also you get to learn more spots on spots I have found. I feel like I have to be running and gunning a bit more on the big water, although I know its just in my crazy head. Have fun and good luck!"

1246858,Golden Eagle,2010-11-04 14:00:00,2642,"Finding huge walleyes and huge pike in the same water is a challenge. I get into lots of nice pike and tons of small to medium walleyes, but very few huge walleyes in the same lake as huge pike."

1247323,DoorCo,2010-11-06 19:39:00,14,I've fished Grace lake and it was a fun trip. We caught a ton of walleye mostly 15 to 23 inches. We caught northern but nothing of any great size. Went in early July.The lake is plenty big. You have quite a few options on different structure to fish. Can catch them right off the dock if you don't want to go far. The lake is in shape of a horse shoe with the caben in the middle of the shoe.The gawleys run a good set of camps.
1247581,AMPHIB206,2010-11-08 07:20:00,191,"Apisko Lake in Manitoba holds the record pike caught by a Minnesotan about 5 years ago. It measured in at 60.5 inches. Pictures were taken and there are witnesses. The fish was released. Pictures were never forwarded to Sas Lodge (they own Apisko). The cabin is remote, you would be the only people on the lake. You will be flown in on new amphibious Cessna Caravans from St Andrews airport. The flight is just less than an hour. Northway Aviation (they own Sas Lodge/ Apisko) Kesch) are replacing all the mattresses in all their cabins, and are continuously upgrading their cabins/docks/boats and motors. You'll have a great opportunity to see moose, bear, mink. It's remote, but has modern amenities; it will be a great experience. Quite a few guests stay at their main lodge at Sas, and take a 1 day fly in to Apisko. The walleye fishing is unbelievable for a shore lunch; and there are so many places to find pike, large pike. The lake is not that big, you would be able to fish it on a windy day. Send me a PM if you want any further information. Greg"
