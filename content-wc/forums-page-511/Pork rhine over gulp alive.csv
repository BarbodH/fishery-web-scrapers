1248218,TIGHTLINER,2010-11-10 17:16:00,223,Has anyone used pork rhine instead of gulp alive or gulp. If so the pros and cons to both and did it catch fish while jigging and casting? You never see much on the pork anymore but it is always in the store. If you used it what did you use color and length and how was it fished? Any info will be helpful
1248238,Bill Krejca,2010-11-10 17:59:00,6107,"I've found that pork rind works well on baits that are cast, such as spinnerbaits and spoons, albeit, I haven't used it in that traditional manner for quite some time. I have used it along with tubes, fishing vertically. There was some good news and some bad news. The good news is that the increased action seemed to increase the number of bites. The bad news is that it had a tendency on the bite of bending back over the hook point, such that it prevented a decent hook set. After several instances of getting a bite, ""setting"" the hook, and having the fish get off, and then reeling in the bait to discover the rind double hooked, I quit using it. Perhaps others have been more successful. Bill Krejca"

We like to use the color white. We have never tried it jigging (except for Largemouth bass with the famous ""Jig n Pig""). Have a great yearThank you,Larry Mac"

1250332,Bill Krejca,2010-11-19 18:03:00,6107,"One thing I have tried with good results: The Berkely Gulp salt water strips, which are pulled apart and used like a ""pork rind'. They come, I believe, in several lengths and colors. They have good action, work well with tubes or bucktails for crappies and walleyes, and are soft enough that they don't restrict hooking, as I had indicated pork may do. They also stay on fairly well, good for multiple fish, usually, but of course don't have the staying power of pork. I haven't seen them in Cabela's stores, but are shown on line, either have to order, or get from the Prairie Du Chen shipping store. Bill Krejca"
