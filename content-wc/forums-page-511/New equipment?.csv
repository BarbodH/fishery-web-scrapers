1249672,tjsker,2010-11-17 00:04:00,301,Have not spent much time on the board in the last 18 months and I was just wondering if there's any worthy replacements to what I used on Lac Seul a couple years ago. I have a Lowrance H2O with the Navionics chip that includes LOW and Lac Seul. I'm guessing the chip is a 2007 version. Is the newer electronics and chips out there worth looking at? Hoping to hit Lac Seul this coming summer.

1249746,KTroller,2010-11-17 10:15:00,237,I'll echo Bill's opinion on the i-Pilot. The anchor feature and record a track were awesome! I did not use my physical anchor at all during my week on Lac Seul this past year.I am also curious if any improvements have been made to the Navionics chip since 2007. It is OK but there are some spots where it is way off.KT
