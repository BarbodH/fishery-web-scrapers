First day they can show you a few spots and you can go from there. They are walleye, pike, lake trout, and the odd white fish. If you have any questions just let me know. They have all well serviced nice size boats and dont have to travel far unless you want to. If you like trout fishing or have kids going it is great fun with down riggers or drop shooting in 90 feet of water on those super hot and flat calm days."

I don't really want to be as far west as Lac Seul and LOTW. We would still like nice cabins and meals available."

1248261,celticbass1,2010-11-10 19:19:00,67,"Gobig, Boois lodge ends up costing around the 2300-2500 plus tips, which could run another $400-$500 bucks easily and it looks like you still have to fish with guides. I really like driving my own boat and finding my own fish but it looks like a nice place. Kruger, The website I found for Kesagami lists prices from 2003 and it says the website hasn't been updated since 2002, to be honest that concerns me a little. It also looks like you have to fish with a guide at this camp. Topwater, sorry, way to far to drive. Sorry I'm being picky but I have lot's of time to look. I would really like to keep it under $2000.00 for a week, have decent cabins (they don't have to be Marriots in the woods), decent food (I don't need gourmet meals) and I will not go to a lodge that I have to use a guide."
1248272,Mich_Fisherman,2010-11-10 20:26:00,292,"Check out Expeditions-north.com Best walleye fishing (fly in, drive in....) Ive ever had. Been doing Canadian fishing trips for 25 years. See if you can find the last 3 episodes on of Greatlakes Outdoors with Rob Trott....shown on PBS. He liked it there so well...he put 3 episodes on his show. Its a hosekeeping plan...we like it that way as we come and go at as we see fit. Fishing until 10pm isnt a problem. Our trip last year was $829 for the outfitter (including flight in and out), boats, motors, gas then we had to buy food and minnows. I have a bunch of pic in my picture gallery if you want to see the fish, the accomodations, etc. Fly in out of Hornepayne, about 8-9 hrs from Rochester."
1248336,Kruger,2010-11-11 07:50:00,259,Here is a link to Kesagami http://kesagami.com/lodge-1.htm . It is more than $2000. I got the impression from your first post that you wanted something comparable to Wollaston but less expensive. Guides are available but not required.
1248384,DROP SHOT,2010-11-11 10:15:00,10,I have been telling guys on here about this place. I really like it and it is up to you but if I was going to spend the money on a fishing trip check them out the website easy to use unlike the rest www.nestorfalls.com and Dave has owned this for 25 years and has very nice stuff and staff goes out of it way to help you out.
1248395,Bigfishhunter,2010-11-11 10:41:00,803,In Manitoba - you gotta go west if you want to live big. Kississing Lake Lodge. http://kississinglodge.com/
1248549,jWN,2010-11-11 21:03:00,62,I agree with Big Fish Hunter Mannitoba is where you want to be. If you want comparable to Wollaston you will have to spend a little. Farther north the better in my excperiance. I would recomen checking Big Sand Lake Lodge out. The out posts can be done for around 2k which in my book isn't a cheap trip but worth it and you will be fishing waters that only get fished by less then 30 people a year if that many and I don't care what anyone says it makes a diffrence. I am sure there are plenty of places closer and cheaper but your request was comparable.
