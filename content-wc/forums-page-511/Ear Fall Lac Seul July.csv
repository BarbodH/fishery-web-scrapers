1249173,greg2648,2010-11-15 08:03:00,80,We have been going to Lac Seul for 5 years. We stay at Lac Seul Lodge (highly recomended). We can get to the Sand Banks in about 25 min. Broad Lake in about 40 min. We had great fishing at both places this year (July). We only saw one boat at the Banks. No boats at Broad Lake.
1249332,scgibby11,2010-11-15 17:24:00,109,"In my photo attached, are these the sand banks in red?"
1249352,bigtimeelectric,2010-11-15 18:32:00,174,"no they are right on the beach where you wrote ""are these the sandbanks"" them are the big sand banks, and in my opinion the only 1 of the 2 worth fishing."
1249433,JDP,2010-11-16 07:12:00,1457,bigtimeelectric is correct...there are other locations in Mckenzie that can produce as well! Don't just fish the sandbank.This is particularly true if the wind is not blowing in on the bank.
1248792,scgibby11,2010-11-13 07:29:00,109,"Hi.I'm looking to get a sense for just how busy the Ear Falls portion of Lac Seul is in July. I'm going with my family of five, and my kids love to fish. They will be happy with any kind of ""bite,"" and frankly so will I.I just am curious as to how crowded things get. Is is zoo-like with risk of morning collision before light with people jockeying into position? Or are there times you can drift across structure without seeing another boat? (I'm certain it's probably in between....)Thanks,Scott Gibson"
1248803,bigtimeelectric,2010-11-13 08:17:00,174,"scott, the only place it gets crowded is the big sand banks. you will see other boats most of the time, but it is big water there is unlimited places to find fish. One tip don't waste your time in sawmill bay in july. did you get a map yet to study up and jot down some of the places people talk about."
1248808,rather-be-fishin,2010-11-13 08:42:00,429,"I fish Lac Seul in July & early August on the Ears Falls end. It's a huge lake & normally we don't see many other boats while we are out fishing. If someone else is already fishing on a reef or island, I was told by a Canadian guide/resort owner, that you don't move in on them because there are plenty of other areas to fish. So, I follow that advice & haven't had other boats move in on us either. I normally fish Mckenzie/ Bay of Islands area & last year saw more boats fishing than normal, but that was only about 10 boats in site & they are huge bays. I have also fished Goose & Steamboat Bay areas. I wouldn't recommend heading out or coming back in the dark due to many unmarked hidden rocks/hazards. Plus there is no need to head out that early, it is a dark water lake & the walleye seem to bite all day long. Normally, around 8:00am there seems to be a Lac Seul ""rush hour"" of boats headed out from the resorts in far northwest end across Goose & Steamboat Bays, but then the boats disperse & you will be able to find your own favorite hot spots to fish & enjoy all to your selves! It's an AWESOME lake to fish walleyes! Where will you be staying? Have a GREAT TRIP! 8 months & counting down to my next trip to Lac Suel!!!"
1248883,scgibby11,2010-11-13 18:38:00,109,"Thanks. I look forward to others' thoughts.I do have a map. It is a waterproof map that I ordered of the NW portion of LS. It has several named bays/descriptors on it and underwater depth/structure. It is from Canadamapsales.comWith all the structure shown, I sure will be leary about hitting some reef! I'm going to check my GPS chip and make sure I have the best detail possible as well. Any other advice or map recommendations?I don't see anything that says ""sand banks"" on my map. Can you tip me off where that is?I'm staying at Timberlane lodge.Scott"
1248886,bigtimeelectric,2010-11-13 19:05:00,174,sand banks are located in the eastern end of mckensie bay on the south shore you can see them once you clear the shanty narrows and look to your left. tip when you get to the shanty narrows slow up and if there is another boat coming wait or them and ollow them through. as it is a little nerve racking the first time...
1248892,scgibby11,2010-11-13 20:13:00,109,"Boy, if my measurements are correct, it must be about 17-18 miles from the mouth of the English river (near Ear Falls) to the Shanty Narrows."
1248902,skindzier,2010-11-13 21:56:00,137,"Your measurements are pretty close. With my 17' with a 115, it takes about 40 minutes to get to the far side of Shanty in reasonable winds. If the winds are forecast to be high, McKenzie is not a great idea, as Steamboat Bay can be an absolute nightmare when it kicks up."
1248903,bigtimeelectric,2010-11-13 22:14:00,174,"yes it is a long run,but can be worth it if you can't find a consistent bite closer to home. the first year there we had a tough bite and were not gonna go back to lac seul until we heard about mckensie bay and the sand banks. This will be our 6th year going back!!!!"
1248951,rather-be-fishin,2010-11-14 08:25:00,429,"Yes, it is a long boat ride to McKenzie bay. Are you bringing your own boat? If so what size boat/motor do you have? Don't make the trip to McKenzie if there are high winds predicted. Is this your first time going to Lac Seul? I stayed at Timberlane several years ago. There is some good fishing spots near by. Send me a private message & I can fill you in on some spots. RBF."
1248954,KTroller,2010-11-14 08:49:00,237,"Scott, I usually stay at Timberlane in mid to late June. You'll have a great time and good fishing. Vance, Wendy, Chris & Co. are excellent hosts. Chris will be able to tell you where they are biting. The run to McKenzie is a long one so pack a lunch or plan a shore lunch because you'll want to stay all day. Lots of big water on the way so as others have mentioned, pick a day with light winds.Other places that are closer to try that time of year would be:The Sanctuary right up by the falls. Very picturesque there and not too far so you can check it out, snap a few photos and be on your way if they're not biting in there. It is a good windy day area with lots of places to stop and fish along the way.Steamboat Narrows. South of the narrows on the East or West side. Use your electronics to find the depth the fish are at and then just move around. You could also anchor.Lunker Point. This is a spot I usually just bop through on my way to other places. I've had good full days there too though especially if there have been a couple days in a row of S or SW wind.Sand's Island. There is a shallow flat on the NE side that you can hit quickly on your way to Steamboat. Often nothing there but if they are they'll be eaters.I haven't given away anyone's secret spots by calling these places out but they are all worth checking. I usually try to ask some guys who are leaving camp when I arrive where they've been fishing and then spend some time with Chris on the dock to make my plan. Oh, and in the evening don't forget to try the camp dock, bridge or around camp.With any luck I'll be up a few weeks before you and can give you some more info then. I can hardly wait!KT"
