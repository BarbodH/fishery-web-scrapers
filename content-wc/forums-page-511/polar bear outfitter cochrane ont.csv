1248569,TIGHTLINER,2010-11-12 05:01:00,223,Been looking for a fly in has anyone used polar bear outfitters before and if so would like some info. Lakes fished -cabins-boats- service and any hidden $$ at the end of the trip. I talked with the outfitter back in the 90's about a trip but never put it together. How was the fishing compared to other fly ins in ontario. What are some of their better lakes looking for large northern with lots of walleye. Thanks for responding.
