1247304,trapperbob,2010-11-06 18:30:00,45,looking for anyone from north of border who is familiar with this lake and lodge? we are thinking of going fishing next year at this lake.

The cabins are functional, well maintained and include indoor facilities, electricity and hot water including showers. The walleye fishing can be phenomenal. We've had our slow weeks. It all depends on weather and whether the water's up or down and all that. In 30 years, however, we have not noticed any negative trends and, by all accounts, the walleye population seems healthy. Your favorite approaches will catch them. We troll and jig. Some drift. Worms, leeches, plastics and Gulp are all proven baits. It doesn't seem to matter. On a good week they fall to any method. In terms of size, they are your average 2-3 pounders for the most part. Trophies, however, swim these waters. The largest our group has ever caught was 8lbs but I have witnessed many up to 12 lbs and am aware of the largest documented fish to be 16lbs. We troll for pike and we have all netted 20+ lb fish. Thirty pounders have been on then off. Our recent interests have turned to fishing lakers and our success increases with time and experience. We troll with Dipsies and spoons. The largest, so far, is 15lbs. This lake yeilds fish much bigger and probably will continue to do so. There is not a lot of fishing pressure put on the laker population. Seasonally, the walleye seem to bite better in numbers in the mid-June time slot. Pike fishing picks up as July approaches but we have had some of our most productive walleye bites in July, as well. Though we have caught lakers early and by accident while trolling for northern in June, they seem to turn on in mid to late July. In recent years, rather than trying to target everything in one week's time, we now schedule an early and a late trip to cover all bases. The Clova Road is the access to camp. The approximately 75 mile stretch can take anywhere from 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours, depending on the amount of traffic it has absorbed and the weather which, if rainy, can create washboarding, washouts and rough spots. Many now drag their personal craft into camp. I would not because we have been satisfied with the boats and motors provided by the outfitter. Those who decide to bring their own rigs will beef up their trailers and bring vital spare parts ""just in case"". They can also figure to add a couple hours of travel time into and out of camp. When we were younger, we'd drive straight through from home (11 hours). For the past few years we've opted to stay over in Maniwaki on Friday and drive the final stretch on Saturday refreshed and ready to hit the water. If there is any more you need to know, post and i will reply."
1248759,trapperbob,2010-11-12 22:12:00,45,Thanks for the helpful feedback. Were the boats well kept and were the motors well cared for? How long did it take you to get there from the usa/ca border? we usually cross over at thousand islands bridge. Also did you ever stay at the outposts or usually at the main camp? We are pretty sure we are going to give them a try for next year. thanks
1248907,4Paulie7,2010-11-14 03:05:00,30,"The boats are functional 15' Princecrafts. They show wear but do the job. The 15hp motors are constantly maintained and any problems we have ever experienced have been resolved without issue. Many years ago I had the opportunity to fly into one of the outposts at a nearby lake and one year we took a guided trip into another trophy lake. There is little discernable difference in the quality of fishing, in my opinion. There are two outposts acessable by boat from the main lodge. In my opinion there seems little reason to trade the comfort of the main camp for a week in an outpost. We prefer the option of fishing the main lake. One outpost (Clatouche) is located on a smaller lake and we will generally travel into it twice or three times during our stay, especially if we are in search of pike. From the 1000 Islands Bridge it takes a little more than an hour and a half to get to Ottawa. With favorable traffic we are out of there and on our way north in about 20-30 minutes. From there its maybe two hours to Maniwaki. We stay overnight at the Auberge du Draveur on Friday night (there are other motels, also) and head into camp for the last four, or so, hour drive into camp, most of which is on the Clova Rd. We pick up our beer (it's cheaper in Quebec than Ontario) and fill up the tanks. Like I mentioned, once on the Clova Rd conditions change and it can take anywhere from less than three to three and a half hours to camp but by breaking up the trip in Maniwaki, we arrive at the camp refreshed and ready to pound it hard."
1249124,trapperbob,2010-11-14 20:58:00,45,Thanks for the extensive feedback. We intend to try the this lodge next year most likely the week of June 18th. Probably stay at main camp.
