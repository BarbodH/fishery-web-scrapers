528093,Guest,2003-02-28 10:01:00,0,"KNEE LAKE Best Pike fishing around. If you can't catch a trophy there you won't anywhere. It is unbelievable, some great Wally action to.Awessome resort and good guides"
528094,North Of 55,2003-02-28 13:36:00,0,"I live 2 hours away from these lakes & heard nothing but good things about both lakes from friends that fished there.My freind actually owned Utik lodge & sold it to knee lake last year.Utik had trouble with commercial netting a few years ago but problem was fixed by DNR i heard.Seen pictures of both lodges & Knee lake had the bigger & more luxurious set up.I heard that the meals are fit for a king!Also seen pictures of some fish caught on knee & there are alot of monsters, especially pike.Good fishing & enjoy the trip!Oh,if your going you better try & book now , it might even be too late."
528095,T Bone,2003-02-28 14:39:00,18,"We're looking for summer 2004...so I think we should be okay. I spoke to the Dir of Mktg at Knee Lake Resort and he didn't indicate any haste was necessary. Can I translate ""commercial netting"" into ""lake was stripped of all the good fish and will take many years to recover"" with regard to Utik Lake? What are your thoughts?Thanks."
528096,North Of 55,2003-02-28 14:50:00,0,Tbone;Talked with the previous owner about this & he said that nets were found on two seperate occasions & didnt effect fishing at all.Both lakes are fairly big so bring lots of warm clothes & strong wrists to pull those gators in!Hope i was some help to ya.
528097,stinger,2003-02-28 15:22:00,7,"Knee Lake is A1. Ask the fella at KLL about the other resort they are working on, I believe its on the same lake. Supposed to be 5 star ++++.Insofar as Utik goes, have heard many good things, I know of a group that has been going there for 6+ years now, every last week of June.I think they drive to Wabowden, then fly in. Big pike, lakers too.A rule of thumb for me is, get a copy of the 2002 Manitoba Fishing/Hunting Adventures Guide. Then go to the Master Anglers section, go to species Northern Pike and look at where the big ones were caught. Utik Lake seen there often. You can do this for all the species.Have fun !"
528098,ggg,2003-02-28 21:20:00,115,Some friends of mine went to Knee Lake last year. They said EVERYTHING was absolutely fabulous. They plan on going again as soon as they save enough money !

1248858,Guest,2010-11-13 15:02:00,0,I thought knee was closed and bankrupt.
1248885,Outfitter17,2010-11-13 18:48:00,127,"Knee did go bankrupt and was closed, it did however open under a new name. Not sure where/why Carihill would post wrong info on a post that was 7 years old?"
