1251629,deputy dog,2010-11-25 06:46:00,305,"bottom line is, in my opinion, is a border agent can do his job, and do it well, without being rude and on a power trip. being a l.e.o., and having made the trip north for the last 20+ years, i have interacted with numerous border agents and i must say it is ALWAYS worse coming back into my own country. part of being in law enforcement is public relations and i have found the people, most people, are much more cooperative when you are firm yet friendly with them. usually, when you treat people rudely they respond rudely to you and i believe this is true wherever you work. there is NO excuse to treat people the way some, and probably a very small percentage, agents seem to enjoy doing. i know in my training to become a l.e.o. being courteous, respectful, yet firm was taught as the preferred way to treat people, unless the situation dictates otherwise. sorry for the longwinded reply but when an agent acts the way many on here, including myself, have experienced it is a pure POWER TRIP and there is absolutely no excuse for treating people that way, they simply act that way because they can and enjoy the power that they possess, usually for the first time in their lives! HAPPY THANKSGIVING!"
1251667,Bill Krejca,2010-11-25 08:21:00,6107,"It has been a number of years, maybe a dozen or more, since I went through International Falls, primarily because the folks there on both sides, seemed to be more confrontational. Perhaps they see more ""situations"" there, and their disposition is a result of this, I don't know. The officials at Baudette and Pigeon River, on both sides, are normally pleasant and professional, while getting the job done that they are paid to do. Shutting off the engine as a courtesy, removed sunglasses, and a smile from the driver go a long way toward promoting a minimum amount of time spent at the border. A driver with a smile on his face is less likely to be eager to engage in a ""contest"". I guess that holds true for most of life's interfaces. Bill Krejca"
1251671,Esoxchaser,2010-11-25 08:26:00,1576,"Detroit has two crossings, a tunnel and a bridge, with a lot of commuter traffic. The tunnel is the better way to go because the truck traffic on the bridge can make for long delays. The Canadian side is usually OK, but crossing back to the US your odds are 50/50 of running into a bad attitude. If you don't have an enhanced drivers license everyone behind you will hate you. ."
1246078,TIGHTLINER,2010-11-01 04:35:00,223,Just returned from a fishing trip from pelee island ont. Went thru at windsor sunday oct 31 with no problems. I must say there were plenty of agents out walking around the vehicles with dogs and knee pads on looking under vehicles and going through cars boats and campers. We had no problem just the normal questions did not ask for fishing license or look at the fish. To me it was one of the best crossings i have ever had. Remember before you pull up to the booth you have had your picture taken at least twice and your license plate has been ran and checked. My first cousin was a customs agent and some of the stories he told me would make anyone tip their hats at the agents just trying to keep our country safe. Don't put these people down for just doing what they have been trained to do for the safety of the usa.
1246384,cruiseforever,2010-11-02 09:01:00,177,"It would be nice if all terrorist would be of one color, religion, or fish for one type of fish. I would venture to say we really have no idea what the folks at border are finding. I think some cases are let out to the public. But I think there are a few cases were people are caught and we will not know about it for a few years. We have had more than just a few born in America citizens that would love to cause great harm to their fellow Americans. Outside of delays crossing the border, I have had no problems. I get more attitude from staff at the post office."
1246491,Stripehunter,2010-11-02 17:55:00,577,"You could also be a smuggler, using a fishing trip as a legitimate reason to be crossing the border. It ain't just terrorists."

1249809,Tim Ellis,2010-11-17 14:13:00,745,"Exactly. Its become such a hassle we quit going north of the border into Canada and stay on the USA side. Just as good or better fishing, better prices and no more border hassles. This was after 20 years of 5-8 guys going to Canada resorts at least once per year. Heck there's so many places yet to check out in the midwest for top notch fishing Canada never comes up in the discussions anymore."
1250101,Flip Silverlake,2010-11-18 17:12:00,645,"It seems to have gotten worse since we crossed in August. May be out goverment know's something they arn't telling us, (like that's never happened before) and they are trying to stop another attack. Although if that was the case you'd think they would head south and put more pressure on the southern boarders. Target the goof balls and leave us tax payers alone!"
1250114,Allstate48,2010-11-18 18:54:00,121,"In 2003, 12 of us, two cars, went through the peace gardens, and I think that little sob was there then. Everyone,but me, had pass ports. He pulled us in and checked every piece of paper we had. Carried a gun that was bigger than he was. I got about half peed off, and told him, I crossed at Internation Falls every year for the past 7 years, and he could ckeck his dam records to find out. Finall let us go. Should of shut up, but, he was just showing his authority. Sounds like the little feller is still there! Good luck Doug"

1251222,Guest,2010-11-23 15:10:00,0,Those boys and girls on both sides of the border have a tough job to do. Our Canadian people have just been armed and there is a lot of change happening in the world. Let them do their job. I am appreciative of their work. Relax.
1251435,Kruger,2010-11-24 09:01:00,259,"I get way more irritated coming back than I do going to Canada. When going in, I understand I am asking to be allowed to enter their country. A couple times they have poked around in our van and asked a few more questions. The extra 15 minutes or so don't make much of a difference, since we drive 18 hrs from Alabama. But more than once the four guys(all with passports and Alabama drivers Licenses) get treated way worse than we ever had going the other way."
1243399,Obabikon,2010-10-19 05:29:00,2370,Mike... most crossings go with no problem at all. It's just those bad ones seem to stick with everyone.
1243406,Fish_on,2010-10-19 06:07:00,1856,I crossed into Manitoba four times and Ontario three times this year with no problems at all. Only time we had a short delay was going bear hunting in Manitoba in September. They had us pull over and fill out some paperwork and they checked my buddy's crossbow to make sure it didn't have a short handle.
1244068,81Saluki,2010-10-22 09:33:00,97,This hasn't gone unnoticed by LOTW camp operators see this article in the Kenora Daily Miner & News (posted 10/21/2010). Sounds like a financial blood-bath. We go up 2 or 3 times a year and have seen a sharp drop in the number of boats on the water in the last 4+ years. Sure hope the family-owned camps can hang on!!!
1244094,tv4fish,2010-10-22 14:56:00,2694,"I think it's great that the Canadian Resort Owners are raising this issue. IF they want to survive, they better speak up. Where are MOST of their clients coming from? ---- The U.S. If they want ""us"" to continue to come up there and spend our money, they (meaning the Canadian politicians/ officials) maybe need to change their attitude."
1244101,dutchboy,2010-10-22 15:45:00,5717,"If Mexicans want to cross into the United States should they be required to be questioned, vehicles searched, conform to U.S. regulations? I would think the answer is yes. So, how does it differ then us Americans going in Canada?If we are to self righteous and self important to be put through normal screening processes when entering another country maybe we should just stay home? Now, if you suspect you were unfairly targeted of singled out then I think it's right to be able to fill a claim or protest with the authorities.We must remember the Canadian government values it's citizens safety just as much as the United States values ours. Let them do their jobs.Take a deep breath and relax.............it's a fishing trip not heart surgery."
1244132,Andre (wallyandre),2010-10-22 18:44:00,2274,"I cross borders around 75 times/year and I never encountered any big problem. I answer questions, I don't bring things that I'm not allowed to bring and I enjoy my trip"
1244281,alanexpup,2010-10-23 16:51:00,278,"HI dutchboy. I hate to say this but if you think for a second our leaders, obama reid and polesi value our safety you must have your head in a hole. what have they done about the illlegals here except to give them everything they could possibly want. have you kept up with the killings going on in arizona and new mexico and every other state by illegals!!!!!!!!! a stretch maybe but we have to remember our brothers and sisters near the mexican border that live with the problem while our elected officials do NOTHING but anticipate a huge new group of democratic voters."
1244283,Obabikon,2010-10-23 17:05:00,2370,Kind of a leap there. Politics are a different story.

I have a Passport, an Alabama drivers license, an Alabama tag on my Ford truck, and a rather thick/southern Alabama accent... where am I going to be from?...

1240084,Obabikon,2010-10-03 16:25:00,2370,"No, I think you guys missunderstood. Anyone who brings more than 10k across the border has to declare it. Every time I cross into the US, I'm basically accused of lying about NOT having 10k. I don't ever cross with that much, I do my banking in Ontario, and if I need US money I just write a check."
1240295,Stripehunter,2010-10-04 17:53:00,577,"I was across with a rifle and meat/antlers a few weeks ago. No problem going into canada, just declaring my rifle (which I had the form filled out ahead of time) and paying the fee. Coming back, filled out my game import form, and that was it. Nobody looked at anything I had or anything. These were crossings in NE New York (Champlain and Ogdensburg). Neither side couldn't have been nicer."
1240342,bpetersen,2010-10-04 20:42:00,251,Do you have to pay a fee now to take a gun across the Canadian border from the U.S. How long has this been going on?
1240349,Obabikon,2010-10-04 21:12:00,2370,"Yes, you fill out a form, and pay like $25. It's been going on for quite a few years... it's not new."
1240566,Stripehunter,2010-10-05 18:53:00,577,You can put up to three guns on the form with the same $25 fee. It's good for those guns for 6 months.

1242240,adempsey,2010-10-13 16:51:00,963,"You get power tripping agents on both sides. I lived at a border city in Canada growing up and always hated crossing the border by car because of the unqualified people hired as agents. Unfortunately, oftentimes it's just too much power given to the wrong people."
1242701,walleyedmike,2010-10-15 18:08:00,1126,"Wow, I guess my son and I got really lucky! We crossed into Canada (International Falls) on our way to the AYA Championship back in August, and re-entered the states 3 days later, and had a great experience both times."
1239985,yarcraft91,2010-10-03 06:47:00,11487,"We (2 US citizens) entered Canada 10 days ago for a waterfowl hunting trip. Crossed at Peace Garden, Manitoba. A young Canadian border agent questioned us and one of his questions was ""are you bringing any handguns into Canada?"". ""No"". ""Do you have any weapons you have not declared?"" ""No."" OK so far, right?Inside, he informed us that our ammunition in excess of 200 rounds each (about 100 rounds in total between us) was subject to duty and tax (""Yes, we know."") and that we needed an explosives permit to import the extra ammo. We pointed out that our PALs eliminated the need for the explosives permit. He stated it did not (we think he was wrong because we have researched this topic), but then he immediately backed off and said nobody at the border would hassle us over such small ammo excesses.Then, he asked ""I won't find any undeclared weapons when I search that vehicle, will I?"" (Didn't we already answer that question?) ""No"". ""OK- you can go."" Behaving emotionally neutral and giving short, honest, direct answers is always a good idea at the border.Another (US citizen) party member was 2 hours behind us driving alone. That same border guard asked about handguns in the vehicle, then asked ""Do you own any handguns?"" (How was that any of his business?) and ""Where do you store your handguns?"" (Again, how is that his business?). Our buddy must have reacted differently, because he was told to sit and stay in a chair while the guard and one other searched his vehicle for an hour (and found nothing out of order). We'd never had a border guard at this crossing act this way- he was the most aggressive Canadian agent we have encountered in 10 years. Maybe something bad is going on or maybe this young chap felt he had to prove something. At any rate, he communicated a less-than-welcoming attitude- the opposite of our past experiences. (We're a party of senior citizen US hunters who have never had so much as a speeding ticket, let alone a real crime on our records- in any country)On the way back to the States, the young US guard who examined our vehicle and birds was cordial, polite, professional and non-threatening- just did his job with reasonable thoroughness and made a much better impression with us.If you're crossing at the Peace Garden, be aware there's a young, short-stature Canadian agent with a thin beard who seems to have an above-average interest in asking weapons questions, proving that he's in charge and, apparently, looking for an excuse to drive that message home. Makes me wonder if he grew up in Ontario."
1239998,HighTech,2010-10-03 07:39:00,75,"I have no idea where that agent grew up and in these days it dosen't seem to matter. The last I checked both our countries are a free democracy. Police need a valid reason to stop and inspect you. I realize that border guards have totally different sets of powers but the underling issue when crossing is their attitude toward us and how they do their job. It is expected they treat all travellers regardless of which direction they are crossing as reasonable and law abiding citizens until such time as the traveller demonstartes that they are not. There is no one country monolopy on arrogant rude border guards, they are on both sides. I still think they are in the minority but as travellers we all need to react to the bad ones. In Ontario we have identified issues at the Fort Frances crossing and they are being discussed with our Federal Member of Parliment. As US citizens you folks need to bring similar issues to your Federal agency and reps. I think posting facts (as above) is helpfull and can become a data base of incidents. Just facts and incidents, no comments. I have a 9lb dog, the US border service agent had me dump out 1/4 box of dog food because it was opened (made and manufactured in the USA) because they were not sure it was allowed in the US."
1240001,Shellback,2010-10-03 07:52:00,8083,"Well if he ever crossed into the US and had one of the US agents I've experienced, he's probably just getting even! Truthfully as a US citizen, many US agents seem to have an attitude, rather than the Canadian agents."
1240004,Golden Eagle,2010-10-03 08:07:00,2642,"Does the owner of the vehicle have a CCW permit? If so, it possibly showed up when the plates were run. Five years ago I broke in two new border guards at Fort Frances. They've improved over the years, but they were wicked in 2005. It took a while to recover from their training."
1240005,Obabikon,2010-10-03 08:08:00,2370,90% of my border crossings go without incidentent. More than half of the slowdowns and/or rude officers (which aren't many) occur when I have more than my legal limit of something. The U.S. side quizes me about having 10k in cash multiple times every crossing.
1240011,Golden Eagle,2010-10-03 08:29:00,2642,Government workers don't have the slightest idea about where money really comes from. A few years of running a small business might enlighten them.
1240025,yarcraft91,2010-10-03 10:38:00,11487,"Good thought. No, none of our party's members has a CCW permit. We are currently discussing whether we want to have them.I agree with the comment that US border guards are more likely to hassle us than their Canadian counterparts- at least,where we usually cross the border. This particular Canadian guard stood as a notable exception to the treatment we usually get."
1240028,Golden Eagle,2010-10-03 11:06:00,2642,"I suggest getting the permit. Soon.I mention that a plate check will show that I have a carry permit. It almost seems to put the border guard at ease. We don't spend much time on gun questions and I haven't been searched since I've had the permit.I was stopped at a road block while coming home from a New Year's Eve party this past December. I felt intimidated with all the police cruisers, flashing blue lights and strobe lights. Turned on the lights inside my vehicle, kept both hands at top of steering wheel. Told the officer I was keeping my hands on the wheel, that I had a carry permit and and I was armed. We chatted briefly and I was told to have a good night. I was not asked if I had consumed any alcohol. I had not. When I carry I do not have even a sip of alcohol."
1240032,SinOrSwim,2010-10-03 11:40:00,1528,Most of ours have been pretty uneventful but we have had some years where going into Canada they have given us some trouble. We take quite a bit of beer with us and a couple years ago they tried to tell us we needed a liquor license. Huh???? We said it was for personal consumption and about mid-way through we got a different agent and the whole thing was dropped.We also had a year where we pulled over under the awning and two guys ran across the street to exchange some money. LOL! Agent got pissed and started rambling about how they could be arrested for border jumping. Listening to this guy get so upset was quite funny though. I've also had the American guys try to trip us up. Bringing any fish? Nope. 5 other questions. Followed by.....so all you have is the fish??? NO!!! Quit trying to trick me. Have seen multiple groups sitting and trying to figure out what they are gonig to do with the lone guy who can't get across because of some sort of offense. We have long decided if someone cant' get over.....they're on their own.
1240072,hogridnfool,2010-10-03 15:40:00,349,"Don't know if they still do it but, 25 - 30 years ago that $10K would probably have been confiscated under the bogus claim that it was ""drug money"". 60 Minutes did a show about it. yarcraft91--- Did your friend have any visible NRA stickers or emblems on his vehicle or person? I have heard of people being hassled over that."
