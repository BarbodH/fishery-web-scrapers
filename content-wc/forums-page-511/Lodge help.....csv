1244505,bvanh16,2010-10-24 20:41:00,6,I posted a few days ago on looking to find a few lodges (remote if possible) to fish at next year for about 6-8 guys. With some help form here I found a few new places and have narrowed the list to the following. They are all over the place ....but we are looking for good walleye and northerns the most. It needs to be either drive in or boat in as flying is too expensive. Any info you can give on the following places would be greatly appreciated. We will be coming from Wisconsin. Boat in Outpost on Williams Lakehttp://www.williamslakelodge.net/outpost.htmlRed Pine Lodge at one of the outpostshttp://www.red-pine-lodge.com/foleye...shing-camp.htmThe cliffside cabin on Biscotasihttp://www.ritchiesendoftrail.com/index.htmlOne of the two out posts at Lake Pakashkan Lodgehttp://www.pakashkan.on.ca/Little Moose lodge on Clearwater/Pipestonehttp://www.littlemoose.com/We are hoping to see as little of other boats as possible. Maybe 1 or 2 a day from any other parties.
1244507,bvanh16,2010-10-24 20:44:00,6,I also forgot to say we are not very deep fisherman....like to fish 20 ft or less mostly. Thanks again.....
1244522,LEDBECK,2010-10-25 00:55:00,24,"you may want to consider this place. I stayed at the campground, it's a decent place if you are a camper. if it is a lodge you want you can still drive to the campground and boat to the lodge. either way you can bring your own boat or rent one. I brought mine and don't regret it for a minute. it is a stunning area and the fishing is top shelf.http://www.separationlake.com/index.html"
1244612,Guest,2010-10-25 10:22:00,0,"bvanh 16, I can give you some info and comment on two of the lodges on your list. Williams Lake Lodge & Outpost : Our group was there a few years back and did a split trip.3 nights at the outpost and 4 nighhts at the lodge.Unless things have changed the outpost cabin is rustic(outhouse,lake water,no shower) but sufficient.The main camp & cabins were very well kept and comfortable.Access to this camp is boat-in from the landing on Williams creek 20-30 min. depending on conditions. Fishing - You can expect decent walleye & northern fishing in Williams Lake with a few musky and SM Bass as well.You can also boat up the creek and fish Lac Suel. Little Moose Lodge : A very nice camp,well run and organized.Clearwater/Pipestone chain offers some trophy fishing for musky,northern,smallmouth and walleye as well but these are deep clear lakes and can be tough at times.If you are shallow water fishermen and stay here take the south portage and fish the lake chain to the east.Walleye & Northern will be smaller on avg. but numbers should be better. This is a drve-to lodge and offers several different fishing plans. Good Luck."
1244745,drlee,2010-10-25 18:55:00,409,"Take a look at PRESS LAKE CAMP. Just google it. Remote, good northerns, excellent walleyes, smallmouth bonus, reasonable price, especially for large groups like yours. Only camp on the lake (10,000 acres), no private cabins, no other practical access, two other lakes to boat into, both with good fishing. One walk in, guided only...never fished it only because we catch so many on Press Lake. English river goes in and out of the lake. Good fishing in rapids, island/mainland points, mid lake reefs and humps, shorelines. Camp owners are absolutely first class...cabins are immaculate, indoor plumbing complete, even internet access! Go thru Thunder Bay, west to Ignace, north on paved road (502), then 15 miles of logging road...rough, but I pull my boat in there every year with my 4Runner and see others with more standard vehicles. Just takes time! Hence, remote and no day fishers! Camp is run by Gerry and Barb (she retired as an officer from the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources), and their son, Ryan, who is studying to essentially become a camp owner at the University at Thunder Bay...he is a GREAT young man! In short, you will be well cared for, but don't plan on going over your limit or breaking the law in any way. BTW, the border crossing at Pigeon River (just south of Thunder Bay), is really nice...polite border guards, no long lines, etc. But, if any of your group has a DUI within the last 5 years, don't take the chance. I DO NOT get one penny (US or Canadian) for this post...in fact, Barb and Gerry don't know I am posting this. When you go to their website, for a real treat, go to Vacancies and look at Barb's blog...really fun, entertaining and extremely well written. I love this place. If you go and don't behave, I will kick your ...."
1244809,adempsey,2010-10-25 23:13:00,963,"I can comment a bit on Red Pine Lodge on Ivanhoe Lake.Hosts: Nice folks, but I had very little interaction as they were never really around. They have a store that sells bait, tackle and souvenirs. They also have a restaurant. What irked me most was when I asked about the ""remote"" fishing for trout I got blank stares. It's advertised on their website, I talked about it with them via email but they were not very accommodating at all.Accommodations:We did not stay at an outpost camp, but at the ""lodge"". The ""lodge"" is far from being a lodge, it's more like a giant trailer park. I was quite disappointed and felt very misled by the website. We got stuck in a cottage in the middle of the trailers. It was pretty typical, garage sale furniture kind of moldy smell, but good enough for us. The majority of the other cottages were on the water on a big beach and looked quite nice. So, I wouldn't suggest it for anyone trying to get away from people and get ""into nature"", that's for sure. It would probably be a really good family vacation spot though.Boats:Basic tinnies with 18hp Nissan motors. Our motor ran with no problems, I actually liked the engine, it seemed like one of those motors that took a lot of abuse and kept on going. However, I did tow a couple people back and saw others getting towed back during the week. I also ran into some guys staying at one of the outposts since they had to come in due to their boat engine dieing. They had to borrow a boat from another outpost to get back to camp. So, I would say not the most reliable equipment.At the outpost you will be down the ""river"" [it's actually part of the lake, but it looks like a river]. There were a lot of people fishing in the river, so you may see some people. I think it depends on which outpost you stay at (there are three along the river).The lake is really nice. It wasn't as busy as I expected given the trailer park city. The fishing for us was ok, but we didn't fish nearly as much as we normally would have due to inclement weather. I'd say it has good potential. If you really like to catch true jumbo perch (fat 12""+ fish) this is a good place to do it.I'd go back to the lake, but I would not stay at the lodge. Maybe one of the outposts. I suggest looking at the outposts offered by Air Ivanhoe. They have three boat-in outposts on the lake.Edit: I read your other post and saw you were coming from Milwaukee. I would not head east of Sault Ste. Marie to go fishing. You are much better off west of there. I live in Toronto and try to go as far west as my fishing partners will agree to.The NOTO trip builder is a nice resource to try as well."
1244938,lrpetp,2010-10-26 15:02:00,37,check out whitewing floating lodges in Ear Falls. the houseboats are remote as well as user friendly and have great Lac Seul fishing. If you have questions email me at [email protected] or call 605-881-1351.
1245005,bvanh16,2010-10-26 18:54:00,6,"DRLEEI appreciate your recommendation, I really do. I would not jeopardize your relationship with the owners. That just would not be right. But in fairness I will be going up with a group of 30-35 years olds not only looking to get away to fish, but also drink, play cards, talk about our ladies, etc. So I am sure we will not be exactly straight and narrow. I don't want to have to worry if I am on the boat and I want to have a beer with my sandwich if you know what I mean . Anyways thank you for you post...and if you have any other thoughts I would love to hear them."
1251303,ILScott,2010-11-23 18:46:00,139,"I go to a boat in camp called wine lake camp. website is www.winelakecamp.com. Only camp on the lake and it has 4 other lakes you can fish without portages. You have also 3 other lakes you can portage to. We fish for walleye, northern, smallies and lake trout. This is a camp that is off the beaten path with no electricity, outhouses but it does have a shower house. Nice cabins and great owners."
1249060,Guest,2010-11-14 17:28:00,0,"bvanh16, we have been to Williams 5 years, not with the new owners. Williams is somewhat clear and is only good for Northern, which was pretty good. If water levels are high you run up Williams Bay toward Lac Suel, it's about 40 min run. GPS is very handy as you have to make a few turns. We caught big walleyes on Kleiners Point, but be forwarned there are locals that have a launch nearby so expect company, it was nothing to see 2-3 boats in a small area.It was hard to catch a walleye under 18in. Hope this helps"
1250955,gary2242,2010-11-22 16:05:00,49,"Little Moose Lodge www.littlemoose.com and Clearwater Lodge www.clearwaterlodge.net are both on the Clearwater / Pipestone Chain of lakes. These are lakes that many people don't know about but the fishing for pike, walleye, muskie, bass and lake trout is awesome. The fishing is just as good as Eagle Lake or Wabigoon Lake and a hundred times better than Lake of the Woods. There is very low fishing pressure on those lakes. The access point to Clearwater Lake is only an hour north of Fort Frances so you will save tons of time and gas money. The issue that a lot of people find attractive, especially with the crappy economy, is the safety issue. If you get a call from home and have to leave right away, you can be back in the US in under 2 hours. That is a big deal for business owners."
