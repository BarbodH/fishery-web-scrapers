Looks like, looking at the positive side, a good time to try out some new spots without passersby gawking to jump in with you. We never stop continuing to pay our dues as far as learning more about a body of water, and how different conditions affect the fishing there. Bill"
6448554,prov1800,2020-06-05 06:50:00,5010,Wind wasnt to bad at the dam but rest of Nelson was breezy.No crappies again suspect there spawned out they were in there 2 weeks early this year.water temps almost 70 f 2 weeks ago.Got to be there twice so that was a treat with no boats except us.The big muskie i hooked into was almost right there by the dam.Did good on walleye on left side shoreline in about 6-7 ft.Today 52 km this afternoon.Good day to cut the grass.
6448078,prov1800,2020-06-03 19:28:00,5010,Got out on Cliff Lake with my wife today.lWe were looking for some walleye and smallie and some pike.Found some walleye that we could see but had a tough hooking them.But ended up finding some hungry ones and ended up catching some nice Cliff Lake gold. Few pike which were fun also but smallmouths woukd not bite today except for one.cold water temps might of slowed everything down today.But turned out to be a fun day and nice weather.

6448260,Eckohlt,2020-06-04 11:33:00,3685,"Your right bill he knows how to get under a guys skin showing all those pics,it was very nice of his wife to hand the big walleye over to john so he can get a pic holding the big eye"
6448362,prov1800,2020-06-04 16:00:00,5010,"My solo trip today turned out fantastic.Weather was good but wind was at 40 km so had to find calmer areas.Hard to do today,no matter where i stopped the wind found me.Terrova worked hard today but hung in there.First place i stopped was on a weed bed that had good cabbage almost to the surface in 9 Ft.Had a incredible bite right away.All good sized fish.I even used my slip bobber most of the time.Spent well over a hour there and not sure how many i caught but it was lots.Fished the narrows area and had another good bite there in shallower water with mostly 13-15"" fish but also a fish on each cast.Fished out front of CPR and did well there but the wind there was brutal so went into Nelson Lake to check out crappies.None there again think soawn is done.Caught some nice walleyes in there as well.Fished over by the big beaver dam and caught a few fish there as well and hooked into a muskie which was on for 10 minutes.Brought her to the boat she was close to 50"".no net and she broke off just as well.That took care of my day and headed back to clarks.Pretty bumpy ride.Pretty good sized waves for Cedar."
6448402,Eckohlt,2020-06-04 18:07:00,3685,"ya Ya Ya Ya Ya,ill say it again john nice fish,think I'll just go outside throw a rope over a tree limb I know how to tie a noose"

6448488,Eckohlt,2020-06-05 03:08:00,3685,"Well john if I was in your shoes I would be out doing the same thing your doing,be like the rest of us don't give up on your guiding business completely this year,there's plenty of fisherman when the borders open that still need a good guy like you,I'm not throwing the towel in yet on July 27,I'll quit yapping here so you can get back to sharpening your hooks,rod,or Ron as you call me I'll answer to either lol"
6448522,prov1800,2020-06-05 05:38:00,5010,Sorry Rod.typo error.All hooks sharp.Always take the coating off everything helps to set the hook.
