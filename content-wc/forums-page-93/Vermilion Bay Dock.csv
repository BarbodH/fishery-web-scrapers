6445716,Bill Krejca,2020-05-29 12:22:00,6107,"Re: Docks - Last year, I noticed a nice feature over at Cedar Point Resort- A series of small diameter vertical metal posts fastened to the docks, positioned as a grab bar for folks getting into/out of their boats. It made it considerably easier, without grabbing onto radio antennas, or even other flimsy articles, which can tend to get broken. Not that I have ever had any get broken, mind you. Bill"
6445720,prov1800,2020-05-29 12:23:00,5010,Lol.About 95% of the time there not safe from me.But we have a number of different species here and mostly always one of them will bite.

6445738,prov1800,2020-05-29 12:39:00,5010,Those handles are very nice to grab on to.I saw them at keystone a few weeks ago on th√®re docks also.As you can see they havnt done anything with there docks yet.
