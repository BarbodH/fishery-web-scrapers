6446842,spoonchucker,2020-06-01 06:12:00,82,Below is link to article on great trip my group had to Reilly Lake at end of last July for 5 days. The map chart function discussed is amazing. But as you can see sometimes it is just a function of seeing what works on any lake at any time. Walleye fishing was fish in a barrel. Plenty of action. Extremely well run camp - cleanest we have ever had on arrival. Flights in and out were all as promised. On the short list of lakes we want to fish again and I have been fishing fly ins for over 35 years. Check it out. paste this in to your browser. https://www.onthewater.com/uncharted...n-saskatchewan

Got around 20 pike over 40 inches. Also caught quite a few up to 17 lb Lake Trout Did you get any Lake Trout. All in all a Great Trip Larry S"
