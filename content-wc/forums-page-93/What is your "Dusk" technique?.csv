6441242,gordy28,2020-05-19 14:22:00,437,"On earlier trips we always spent time on the lake at dusk - its probably when we caught the most fish. In terms of techniques we tended to troll with bottom bouncers and harnesses (because it was what had worked during the day) or if the drift was right we would jig In my regular fishing in the Kawarthas I have had success doing exactly what the OP mentioned - trolling Rapala X Raps , Husky Jerks or even Berkley Flicker Shads on the edges (inside and outside) of a big weedbed On our Ogoki trip we spent a lot more time on the water during the day since the lake was so big which meant we didn't fish that much at dusk - personally I missed it. Something about seeing the some come down in the boat for me but the rest of the guys were quite happy to get the camp fire going right after dinner Who knows what 2020 will bring but I am guessing that the dusk fish may not happen unless its a few casts of the dock (which I need to try more of)"
6441272,andreindy,2020-05-19 16:54:00,308,"I appreciate the responses. I tend to refer to the dusk bite as the ""witching hour""....it is that hour or hour and a half before the sun dips under the horizon. Safety is first and there is no dark/night fishing unless someone is feeling highly motivated and energetic to cast off the dock (which tends to catch one of those crazy dock pike). When I used to fish Cass Lake in Minnesota, it was almost like a switch was pushed at the beginning of the witching hour...it is when you caught the majority of the day's walleyes."
6441352,Live to jig,2020-05-19 21:58:00,159,Jig and minnow in 6-10 ft of water....we never miss the night bit that usually lasts till about 11pm. yes we sleep in everyday lol
6441646,Tbayfisher,2020-05-20 08:09:00,31,"In low light, early morning, evening, when the sun is low it's darker shades. Whites, chartreuse etc. Once the sun gets higher it's flashier colours such as gold silver etc. Works wonders."
6441952,Guest,2020-05-20 19:57:00,0,"Night time is the right time! Have had good Luck at Dusk a lot! Sometimes Just throwing a Mepps #5, if were Lazy We have caught some dandys on the ole reliable Dardevle Spoon. And as others have said, we usually stay close to camp. So dang cool coming in after 10 pm, on a long Summer night. We always pick an only cabin on the Lake, so little worries but safety first. We keep the Molsies on ice till the boat is tied up. Good thread. Wishing you guys a good Fishin season. Beer Slayer"
6442086,jackpotjohnny48,2020-05-20 23:33:00,153,"I've been fishing deep, clear, oligotrophic, ""lake trout"" type water the past couple years. So we usually don't even start until about 8 pm. We've been trolling crankbaits from just under the surface down to about 20 feet down in VERY deep water (water depth of anywhere from 70 to 140 feet deep). Before it gets ultra dark, we tend to do ok on planer boards. But once it becomes total dark, I am just as confident (if not moreso) using flat lines. As you suggested in your original post, rattles really seem to help after dark... more noise seems to help the walleyes zero in on the bait a bit better. So while I'm not opposed to using the original balsa Rapalas before dark, I would generally go to a louder bait after dark (something like a Rapala Husky Jerk 14). But the absolute #1 producer for us last year was a Smithwick Perfect 10 Rogue. We were hand holding the rods and Jerking the P10's in order to make more noise. Really scored heavily doing this ""jerk trolling"" routine last year at dusk (until well past midnight) with Smithwick Perfect 10's being the best producer. Another spectacular producer the past 3 years has been the Rapala Husky Mag 15, but this is a slightly bigger profile bait, and we've been trolling it a bit faster (2.9mph to 3.2 mph) using musky rods. When we do the faster routine with musky rod setup, we always have one guy trolling a Rapala Husky Mag 15 (running down about 15 feet), and the other guy is running either a Yo Zuri Crystal Minnow Magnum (16.5 cm) up high, or a Rapala X Rap Magnum 20, running it about 20 feet down over the deep abyss. But the noisy rattling baits seem to be the best. The Rapala Husky Mag 15 is the loudest bait in the Rapala lineup in my opinion, and it's been a FABULOUS producer over the past couple years. The Yo Zuri Crystal Minnows are also starting to become super high confidence lures for me, because again, they make a lot of noise, which seems to help quite a bit after dark. I have some Rapala F18s and J-13s that I've been intending to use after dark, but since they don't have rattles, I don't have quite as much confidence in them. (Although they are terrific DAYTIME baits). From dusk until about 3 am the following morning, just let me troll my minnowbaits (Smithwick P10s, Bandit shallow divers, Rapala Husky Magnums, or Yo Zuri Crystal Minnows), and I'm a happy camper. Note: 3 days before the trip, I always spray my clothes with Permithrin, and I always wear a mosquito suit as well. Haven't gotten a single mosquito bite in the last 2 trips. So a quality mosquito plan is necessary in order to make this work. ""Jackpot"" John Schroeder"
6442396,Guest,2020-05-21 18:03:00,0,We wait til almost dark then troll some rocky points that have produced for the past 30 years. Using chrome and blue back rat l traps.
6442996,Pink Unicorn,2020-05-22 11:11:00,83,"My sister and I started a tradition of trolling random, structure-less areas of the main basin (68 FOW) with giant soft plastic shad or 6"" twisters after supper. This began as a way to sneak a couple of cigarettes and a nightcap with little expectation of actually catching fish. After a couple of years we actually developed a pattern... Following a straight line from where the water comes in to where it goes out, starting in 55', we troll at 1.8mph. The lake is roughly 2 miles wide but we focus on the middle 1/3rd or so, as deep as 68'. We usually end up with at least 4 mid-20"" range walleye, a good pike, sometimes a laker. More importantly we catch a decent buzz, beautiful sunset and that ever elusive appreciation for the moment."
6444524,MikeinMN,2020-05-27 00:24:00,190,"If there is a sandy beach or small broken rock kind of shore within sight of where we're staying, I really like trolling an F18 Rapala around the dusk hour. I like a gold, or gold/fluorescent red colored Rapala, and about 6' or so of water trolling pretty slow."
6446014,northernbite,2020-05-30 06:28:00,1186,"Agreed, man of my own heart. Seems like find shade you'll find some walleye, Paul, should have left yesterday on 3 week trip to NW Ontario, Oh well!"
6441042,BornToFish,2020-05-19 08:27:00,1224,"Greetings, Aspen: You triggered a thought with your previous comment. My wife and I (i.e. mostly me) tend to fish pretty hard during the course of the day. We work hard at it. Evening is the time of the day when we tend to just accept what happens and simply enjoy our time on the water. We enjoy each other's company and the beauty of everything around us. We have had tremendous evening bites, which just seem to be more enjoyable when we are relaxed. Good fishing and tight lines!"

6441080,bthomas3333,2020-05-19 09:05:00,465,"Hey,I learned something early in the year (opening weekend). Around dusk I was still drifting jigs and throwing slip bobbers shallow. A newbie (I was guiding) clipped on a smaller 2-3in flicker shad shallow and cast right up on shore. He picked up two big girls within 10 or so casts. The second one came at right around 1030p and it was dark. I was sure it was a smallie until I saw the eyes glowing. Anyway. Live and learn!Brett"
6441084,Aspencreek,2020-05-19 09:16:00,2911,"The biggest walleye to be brought into our boat was by my brother just before sundown. Floating jig head and leech with a couple split shot pinned about a foot above it. Threw into about 6"" of water and SLOOOOLY dragged it back. He didn't know it was on until it started swimming to the side, then the battle was on. Beautiful 32"" almost 8 #, took a picture, and back in the water she went. The fish lives on but her replica is on his wall, with the jig in its mouth. That was one beautiful sunset. (and I am still looking for that 30"")"
6441094,Mojo-NC,2020-05-19 09:39:00,1929,"Isn't it a requirement in Canada to have bow and stern lights turned on after sunset? For those of you who drag your own boats up to Canada, that's not a problem. How about everyone else who uses camp boats? I don't think anyone in our camp goes out after dark, but then I've only fished Canada in the spring in any lake other than a fly-in. This will be our first year in Canada in the summer (August), provided the border situation is under control by then. Can we fish without the proper lights on the boat? I expect not."
6441098,NARDA 1,2020-05-19 09:44:00,636,"It's not all about the drinking, when you have been going to the same lodge for 30+ years it's about camaraderie and friendship too!"
6441128,BornToFish,2020-05-19 10:28:00,1224,"Greetings, Mojo: I believe that navigational lights are required in Ontario after sunset. The majority of my fishing in Ontario has been from two fishing lodges. I used a lodge boat for this fishing. The lodge owner (same owner, different lodges) did not allow his boats out after dark. His boats did not have navigational lights, to further discourage his guests from staying out after dark. He let his guests know if they stayed out too late. I think his reasoning was that he didn't want to put his guests in a position to hurt themselves or ruin the equipment. Additionally, he didn't want to go out in the night to look for lost guests. I know of one lodge that I believe allows its guests to stay out after dark with a lodge boat. I know that I would not take that chance as a lodge owner or as a guest. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6441132,wmd,2020-05-19 10:44:00,388,I agree with NARDA 1 it's Rye time at dusk! wmd
6441138,Aspencreek,2020-05-19 10:50:00,2911,"Our camp boats are equipped with navigational lights, BUT, like what Born-to-Fish has already stated, staying out on the water is discouraged after dark. If you are not in by dark he let's you know you are not only putting yourself in danger but also his equipment. If you are in your own boat he still discourages it but is OK with it as long as you have the proper equipment to get you back to the dock, ie GPS, adequate spot lights, etc. That is why I'm staying close to camp and can get back to the dock. The rule of thumb is really pretty simple; if you are out after dark and have not let SOMEONE know that your intentions are to be out there after dark, you are assumed to be stranded,lost/broken down/run out of gas and in need of rescuing. Personally, I have never been out in the dark fishing in Canada. 1) any light in the boat is going to attract every flying bug in the area, 2) There are thousands of large boulders and underwater mines that I have not yet discovered, and do not wish too 3)I'm afraid of the dark 4) I need my beauty sleep 5) I have a Weisers and Dr pepper waiting for me back in the cabin. All in no particular order."
6441140,valley366,2020-05-19 10:50:00,193,"We fish during the day and usually quit by 4pm. Go back clean any fish we have, cook dinner and maybe have a beverage. Traveling with younger kids this gives them some time to run off some steam. About 7pm or so we jump back in the boat and hit one of the spots closer to the lodge and setup to jig for the night bite. Some resorts we have been to we have has sensational nights doing this. One in particular we used every piece of bait in the boat and were cutting minnows in 3 pieces to extend the fishing. Most commonly it is just simply a nice relaxing time and usually out produce some of our day fishing in a shorter period of time.As far as lights. The place we currently go the boats are rigged with navigation lights. We don't push the envelope too far and are usually off before it is dark on the water. Other resorts have been to we may not have had navigation lights but again did not push it to total darkness and usually had our headlamps on."
6440918,andreindy,2020-05-18 20:38:00,308,"When we are at our mid July fly-in, I grab my brother-in-law at dusk and we tie on Rapala balsa stick baits and slow troll them along a shoreline across from the camp. We tend to do this in about 5-6 feet of water as the stickbaits seemingly go down a couple feet. The excitement when even a smaller walleye yanks that rod out of your hands...my brother in law talks about those dusk trolls all year round. I suspect a stick bait with rattle could be even more effective? Anyway, there is something about fishing at dusk that seems to add an extra level of anticipation. Maybe it's from all those magazines as a kid that talked it up. Do you have a dusk technique?"
6440922,NARDA 1,2020-05-18 21:04:00,636,"My go to ""Dusk Technique""..... That's me on the far right!"

6440940,prov1900,2020-05-18 23:43:00,544,"Most times we hit the docks with lighted bobbers, and some adult beverages. Great times! And by dusk, we have hit the wall for being in the boat and maybe....just maybe, aren't in any condition to operate a boat...LOL"
6440960,BornToFish,2020-05-19 06:05:00,1224,"Greetings, We normally go out after dinner and check out a handful of spots that are relatively near the lodge. We tend to select spots that are a short run back to the lodge when the light is fading fast. After checking out a handful of spots, we pick the one spot that seems to be most promising on that particular evening, under the prevailing weather conditions. We often end up fishing with jigs + live bait near weed lines that are relatively close to deep water. Andre: You mentioned that you often troll in the evenings in shallow water that is near shorelines. I had one thought come to mind regarding your trolling. If your lake is deep enough to have ciscoes and whitefish, you might want to consider trolling in the evenings over deep water in the main lake basin. You might not put up big numbers of fish, but you might be surprised as to the size of the fish that you catch. This pattern normally sets up when the lake develops a thermocline. I'm a rod-in-hand kind of angler, so don't spend a lot of time trolling. However, the pattern that I just described does work! Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6440978,Rondogpike,2020-05-19 06:45:00,24,Whatever has worked all day long... in this case a jig and a tail.
6440980,Bill Krejca,2020-05-19 06:51:00,6107,"Back when I used to get out earlier in the morning (earlier being a relative term), I always, and still do try to hit the shaded (East) shore first thing. In the evening, I try to hit the shaded (West) shore. Walleye and crappie seem to prefer hanging out in shaded areas,where their superior eyesight is to their advantage. Shaded areas can also be created from humps under water, it just isn't as obvious where these spots are without paying a lot of dues on a particular water body. Bill"
6440984,The tank,2020-05-19 06:57:00,340,Cast for musky. Tired of walleye fishing for the day.
6440992,rockape,2020-05-19 07:07:00,215,"I fish my *** off all day in Canada. I jig and crank for walleye, but probably spend 50% of my time casting big baits for pike and musky. We never go back in for lunch (if you fish Lac Seul you understand) either. We fish until dark often so we don't eat dinner until maybe 11pm. Hitting the booze and maybe some cards until the walleye food coma sets in! REPEAT!"
6441016,Aspencreek,2020-05-19 07:45:00,2911,"After Dinner we will hit the spots close to camp also, but as said before there is a particular spot on the western shore that has a reed/sand bed in about 3-7' of water that is adjacent to 20-30' deep drop off. We anchor in deep water and slip bobber or Lindy rig onto the reeds and sand bank, and enjoy the sunset."
