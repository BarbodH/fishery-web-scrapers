6445236,mms3rd,2020-05-28 10:21:00,148,"Mn DNR has a lake finder site for many, many lakes in the state that have fish survey results for most....some surveys are a little old, but they give a look at what DNR has found in the lakes....e.g., some have a lot of walleyes, some have none, same wither species. I haven't checked big border lakes."

We still have our plane reservations and a hotel night coming and going reserved with no chance of changing those. Thought we might just head up to a Minnesota based walleye fishing camp. Can you guys recommend a place within a couple hours of Int. Falls? And maybe a guide if needed??? Thanks."
6441342,The tank,2020-05-19 21:19:00,340,Rainy lake on the US side is real good.
6441344,The tank,2020-05-19 21:20:00,340,Kabtogama just south of IF. Lake vermilion. Crane lake all in that area can be good.

6441362,GBS,2020-05-19 22:49:00,2271,"Call a few of the resorts on Lake Kabetogama. The one we go to had a couple of cancellations (Covid and travel related), so gave us a sweet deal if we would extend our stay. Usually everything is booked that time of year, but you may very well find a few openings for your dates. Beautiful lake, and the State restrictions on guides just got lifted, so there may be openings there too. Likely there will be none that have any kind of meals due to Covid, so you will have to bring your own food/supplies, but the groceries in the Falls are open, and most places have kitchens with everything you need."

6441534,The tank,2020-05-20 04:46:00,340,For a guide on lake of the woods talk with lake of the woods outdoorsman. He may help with a place to stay also. Great guy. We stay on the Canada side. I forgot when I recomend lakes that there's a big area in Minnesota.
