6444618,jambi,2020-05-27 07:58:00,504,My Brother-in-Law took his son twice (at age 8 and again at age 10) to Woman River Camp and had a great time. They used a guide part of the trip and fished solo remainder. I think if you can get a guide for part of your trip it will help you out finding fish and pattern for the time you are there.
6444722,gordy28,2020-05-27 10:08:00,437,Not sure where you are coming from but I have personally done two trips w White River Air and their camps may fit the bill. Air Dale out of Wawa also has a solid reputation and also has some good single cabin outposts that might fit the bill Cheers and what a great idea Andrew
6447056,Angler1700,2020-06-01 15:44:00,37,"My dad took me on 5 day trips to NW Ontario when I was 5 years old (1988). This was tent camping on Crown land, on an island, waaaay back in the boonies down some old logging road. The truck ride was always so bad on the gravel road, you'd throw up from the motion sickness. We would arrive 7-8 hours after we left from Winnipeg, throw everything into the 12 foot aluminum with a 7.5hp Merc on the back and make our way to our spot. He had been going since 1980. I cherish those memories so much whether we caught or not and there are so many stories about catching fish and about overcoming hardships along the way (motor don't start, wrecked pull ropes, endless storms, bears at the site, vehicle didn't start, tornado ripped through once, etc) that really are what is important.Last year, my son was 5 and we took him. Now, the boats are a little better today, the tents have improved and the backwoods campsite has some amenities that we've built over the years, but the bottom line is that it's the memories that you build with your family while you are out there. Kids are insanely adaptable. Leave the tablets at home and have them enjoy some quality time with Dad."
6444234,RRK285,2020-05-26 11:50:00,44,"My boys 10 & 8 beg me to come to canada every year. That day is coming I know. They are good fisherman and have fished lots of waters. Does anyone recommend a Canadian place which would be good for kids. Lots of action, not too big of water, etc? I have been to Lac Seul , Eagle, LOTW, Minnitaki, Cedar, and Red Lake but I am looking for something much smaller and manageable for them."
6444248,MrSimon,2020-05-26 12:08:00,922,My advice would be take them somewhere you are familiar with - even if it's a big body of water.
6444262,kettyspanky,2020-05-26 12:43:00,271,I go to whitefish lake over by thunderbay. Not a huge body of water. Perch fishing is fun for the kids. Northern caught while Perch fishing. Walleye morning and night. Lots of kids fish off the dock and catch fish. Pretty cheap Trip.
6444264,Knutson21,2020-05-26 12:44:00,348,"I started going when I was 7, and my dad took me where ever the group was going that year. I never missed a year. Last year my son was 7 and I started the same tradition, we were at a private cabin 18 miles from our car with no electricity, running water, etc. He had a week with the guys with out his mom (my wife) and his sisters. It was truly amazing 3 generations fishing in the boat together, only wish it was (4) generations, he never got to fish with my main boat partner as a kid (my grandpa). I don't know why you have to tailor a specific trip around bringing your kids? My only hope is that I will be able to bring him somewhere later in the year since our planned trip will be cancelled due to Covid."
6444272,stumcfar,2020-05-26 13:15:00,451,"Took my son for the first time when he was 10. We went to Lac Seul. As I dropped down the anchor on our first spot, my son was baiting up and dropped the jig down. He had a fish within seconds. He was hooked from that time on. Lac Seul is a great place to take kids. Lots of action and if you go early in the year, great fishing close by, at least on the Ear Falls end."
6444280,bigcreekdad,2020-05-26 13:36:00,74,"I don't know where you live, but I recommend Cranes Lochaven Lodge on the French River. I've been going there with my two boys for years. American Plan."
6444286,Carnhzkr,2020-05-26 13:44:00,964,"I'm the youngest of 4 siblings. My dad started dragging his family to Canada when I was 5 or 6. Those early trips were not intended to be fun for the family. Those were all about my dad catching fish, or at least trying to. I remember how long some of those afternoons in the boat felt when the fish weren't biting, so I was determined that when it came time to take my own sons the trip would be more about them having fun rather than about me catching fish.My sons are now 21 & 24. I took each of them on their first trip when they were 6. Six is probably younger than I'd recommend, but I knew my sons and knew they would both be able to handle the trip. We took our fist trip as a family of four when my youngest was 7 and oldest was 10. That trip was to Wenasaga Lodge, just outside of Ear Falls. Wenasaga Lake is about 7 miles long and there's an incredible waterfall which pours out of Bluffy lake and is accessible when you boat up through Wenasaga River. My kids had a blast hiking the trail up the falls and fishing in the pools. There's a much smaller falls going out of the lake and that provides another opportunity for kids to climb the rocks and fish the pools or below the falls. The lake itself is easy to figure out and shouldn't be too hard to find good numbers of smaller walleye. One of the things my kids loved about the trip was that the owners had several boat caches on smaller lakes that you could dive then hike to and catch tons of small pike or walleye. One day when the weather looked iffy, we took the morning off and went in to Ear Falls to see what there was to see. We got the most expensive ice cream cones I ever had at Smittys.I'd recommend Wenasaga as a good lake for a family and/or trip with kids. I probably wouldn't recommend it as a guys' trip, since you drive by Lac Seul, Cedar, and Perrault to get there, which are all much better fishing lakes, but it's a really good lake for kids to have fun and adventures."
6444294,valley366,2020-05-26 13:47:00,193,"I too would base it off of the fishing more than finding a kid friendly lodge. Took my kids to a kid friendly lodge that had swings, sand boxes and other play things. Mine spent more time playing in the shallows, fishing off the docks, playing in bonfire and other outdoor activities. Take the technology away as soon as enter camp for the week and you will be amazed at what they will entertain themselves with."
6444374,CI_Guy,2020-05-26 17:13:00,2118,"I'd recommend the Sioux Lookout area. You have access to Pelican for a small lake, Abram's is a little larger and you could also go through Abram's shoot to Minnitaki if you wanted to try big water."
6444438,7thCrowWing,2020-05-26 19:11:00,132,"Took my 10 year old to Woman River Camp north east of Ear Falls, as remote as you can get on a drive in, smaller lakes ,(chain of 9 ) lots of action and there are portage lakes that are easy to get to or even drive to. We had a great experience there and are going back this year if the border opens."
