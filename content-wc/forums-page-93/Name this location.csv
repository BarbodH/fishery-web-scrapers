6448802,Golden Eagle,2020-06-05 15:39:00,2642,At first I thought it was Old Man Kelsey's Pond
6448808,stjoeguy,2020-06-05 15:56:00,979,"Oh, that hurts. We should be driving by that spot right about now on our way to spending the night in Sioux Lookout and heading out to Lake St. Joseph in the morning. This was supposed to be our week. Sigh....."
6448810,walleyecheek,2020-06-05 15:56:00,2231,No...i think old man's kelsey's pond is in Cookeville Tennessee ?
6448822,pjshorthorn,2020-06-05 16:27:00,5654,"As others have said, 100% that it is Frog Rapids. A great looking place that I have been driving past since 1982. It is on the bucket list of places to visit in my lifetime. For what ever reason, Lac Seul speaks to me like no other lake I’ve been to. Frogs Rapids sits on a prime location to explore a vast amount of the SE section of the lake.PjShorthorn"
6448900,Golden Eagle,2020-06-05 20:13:00,2642,"Close. When my son was in high school, he passed a swamp, on edge of a new subdivsion that he finally tested and caught several bass that were released. Booger Swamp then and now. Never drained. Got to be spring fed."
6448336,Skywagon,2020-06-04 14:49:00,1106,"I can't help but to always take a close look when I drive past this location, it is a unique place. A lot of you guys will recognise this camp, I drove past today and had to stop to take a picture. There were no boats tied to the dock, nobody was out fishing on either side of the bridge, just a typical winter picture, except there is no snow or ice and it is June. The new norm for N/W Ontario this season."
6448338,walleyecheek,2020-06-04 14:52:00,2231,Frog Rapids Camp ?
6448342,walleyecheek,2020-06-04 14:57:00,2231,Is Knobbys still in operation ?
6448368,eyecatcher1,2020-06-04 16:32:00,323,Looks like it to me. I stay close to there when I'm up there.

6448584,rockape,2020-06-05 07:31:00,215,"Never stayed there, but passed it by boat and truck a thousand times. Caught many a walleye and pike there. Bummed I won't get to pass it this year."
