5700522,lbl guy,2017-08-03 19:19:00,7,"Northern wilderness outfitters in my book is the best choice for your group! Close by to Fort Frances, great schedules fair pricing, great food package and great fishing, great staff and people!"
5700658,aceshawk,2017-08-03 21:00:00,17,"NWO is fantastic. As mentioned earlier, Dasent is a nice lake. Real quiet and access to Pippio and even Shikag."
5700978,Baseline,2017-08-04 05:33:00,3207,I flew with Rusty Myers twice and was very satisfied with their services. They have been in business for 50 plus years so that should tell you something.
5702634,dschiebel,2017-08-05 03:22:00,85,"Been flying with them for twenty years, Vic or Mitzi can answer all questions. Been to 5 different lakes. All were outstanding Sessi very hard to get into. Was there 6 years ago, hasn't been an opening at that lake since."
6448660,goblue,2020-06-05 09:53:00,9,"Rusty is good but the cabins are dated. Northwest is also good, cabins are a step-up. If you are willing to drive a little further try Pipestone-very clean cabins."
5697362,eyegator,2017-08-02 07:38:00,29,"I'm looking for some input from the crowd on these 2 outfitters.My dad wants to do a fly in next summer in Mid-late July. For some random reason, he is obsessed with making the drive as short as possible- and he mentioned looking for a fly-in that takes off just across the border. He seemed to like the idea of staying in International falls and having a short ride the next AM. I stumbled across these two outfitters-- does anyone have experience with them? Any outposts you'd recommend? We are 90% walleye fisherman- and would like a numbers lake, with a chance of catching a couple larger fish.Are there any other resorts that fly out of close to the Fort Frances area?"
5697410,ziemann,2017-08-02 08:07:00,641,"I travel through Fort Frances on my way to Atikokan 8-10 each season. It always seems like both Northern Wilderness and Rusty Meyers operations are busy. There's always a large number of cars parked there whenever I've driven by. There are lots of area lakes that are great for walleye that can be accessed by plane from Fort Frances. If you're looking for something a bit further out (but an easy drive from International Falls), Kashabowie Outposts is across the lake from us and have a good reputation as well. http://www.kashabowieoutposts.com/"
5697514,michigan walleye guy 2.0,2017-08-02 08:50:00,240,"I would recommend Nestor Falls Fly-In Outposts, which is an hours drive from I-Falls. Specifically, I would recommend Keeper Lake, which is a huge numbers lake for walleye. They aren't the cheapest outfitter in Northwest Ontario, but there are none better. www.nestorfalls.com"
5697698,KSjim,2017-08-02 09:51:00,88,I have a buddy that has used NWO many times over the years and has always been happy with them. Moberly is the walleye lake they prefer for the combination of numbers and size.
5697978,adempsey2.0,2017-08-02 11:14:00,611,"Along with Melaire, those two are the main fly-in outfitters in that area, but there are a couple more camps that fly out of Fort Frances you can check out.http://melaire.cahttp://www.moosepointlodge.comhttp://flyinfishingresort.comhttp://tenmilelakecamp.com/http://www.silvermuskielodge.com/http://www.campbellscabins.com/air-s...utpost%20campsSent from my SM-G903W using Tapatalk"

5698114,jamesherbst,2017-08-02 12:26:00,12,"I've flown to outposts with NWO twice. Once to Lake Carillon, and once to Lake Dasant. The Carillon camp is gone due to a fire, but Dasant was excellent for numbers, and we caught several 22"" plus walleyes in the bay right next to the cabin. You'll be able to fish a couple of different lakes and rivers from the Dasant camp. The guys that run the ship over there are friendly, and professional. I'd recommend them."
5699010,eyegator,2017-08-03 07:02:00,29,"Thanks everyone- I will definitely take a close look with NWO.I'm not concerned as much about the actual fly out location being ""busy"" as I am about having a fishing spot that is quiet, well off the beaten path and good fishing.Anyone out there know anything about Rusty Myers?Another thing I noticed-- in the past we we flew out of Red Lake/Ear falls areas and flew within 60-70 miles of there. I see a lot of these flyouts mentioned go to lake that are closer to Wabakimi park and even east of Nipigon. Is the terrain there similar to ear falls, red lake, woodland caribou park areas? I've never ventured that far east."
5699114,That Minnesota guy,2017-08-03 07:53:00,8293,NWO and fly into Tessup lake. Lake is about 4 miles long and 1/2 mile wide. You are the only cabin on the lake. Cabin was very good. We had a great time there. Just bring mosquito fighting equipment.
5699450,srj,2017-08-03 10:43:00,971,"I flew out of Rusty Myers with my folks many years ago when I was a kid. It was a very short flight....take off, climb for just a few minutes, glide in and land. No others on the lake, just incredible walleye action along with the occasional small to large pike. I know quite a few who have used RM since and they have all been happy with the trip. NWO has some very good lakes. Good luck"
