6385946,zenfish,2020-01-13 07:05:00,14,Greetings fellow anglers. I just booked a week in late August at the 2 mile outpost on the Little Current River operated by Namegosikaa Outfitters. I've searched the forums and found a few nuggets that sound very promising. Just wondering if anyone else can chime in with their experience and/or tips. I have always visited Ontario in June so any advice on how the walleye and pike patterns might differ would be welcome. Thanks all!
6387284,yoopertrout,2020-01-18 11:12:00,1172,I'd be interested in hearing more about this outfitter too. Their website is intriguing.

6387666,zenfish,2020-01-19 17:00:00,14,"Yeah, the website could use an update. If you message Jason, the owner, he'll send some pics. You can check out their Facebook page as well."

6440408,dosxx,2020-05-17 18:55:00,60,"I fished this lake a few years ago when it was offered by another outfitter. It was, at the time a typical rustic camp. We went mid July and it was crazy hot that year. The owner loaned us a small generator and a fan to keep cool.The fishing was pretty decent and we caught and ate walleye every day. We seemed to do better upriver from the cabin, in areas where the lake narrowed down. We also had some fun and success near the falls but it was hard to fish that fast water. We did poorly at the opposite end of the lake where water is flowing out and it becomes in-navigable.Despite the heat, we mostly caught fish shallow, mostly on 1/4 oz jigs with grubs of all kinds and some shallow diving minnow baits. We did not use any live bait. We did have incidental pike catches but I don’t recall any really big ones. We saw moose almost every day upriver in a somewhat narrow area.You will definitely have a fly in feel with the drive in convenience. Our outfitter used a quad to bring in our heavy stuff, but we wanted to hit the road early so we carried everything out to the truck when we left which was a bit of a workout, especially the trolling motor batteries!It’s a good lake with enough water to move around a bit. Enjoy your trips!"

6445292,AndyT,2020-05-28 12:34:00,3,"I am booked there for end of July. It's supposed to have a shower, and generator running everything. Excited but also nervous because cant find much info on it"
6445328,RichA$1970,2020-05-28 14:23:00,1159,"The website is pretty rough and could use a wiz kid to give it some life. Sounds like a fun place, somewhat rough but more than serviceable. Keep us posted n hope it goes well."
