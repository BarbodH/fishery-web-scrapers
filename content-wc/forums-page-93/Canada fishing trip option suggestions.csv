6447594,73Wolverine,2020-06-02 18:06:00,7,I'm in the same boat with a lot of others where my annual fishing trip to Canada has been cancelled. Can this group offer some suggestions for a US alternative? Me and my fishing buddy are looking for a quiet walley retreat. Smaller lakes preferred over the Great Lakes. We're in the NE but are considering traveling as far as the Upper Peninsula if that's the best option this year. Thanks all!
