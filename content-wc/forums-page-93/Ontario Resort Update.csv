6449230,gmattbruin,2020-06-07 07:42:00,174,"I just spoke to a drive to lodge owner a few minutes ago. There is a terrible amount of confusion right now for these owners. Our govt here has not done a very good job of giving them good solid black&white direction on what is ok and what isnt. We have a ""state of emergency"" in the province still in effect, which has certain rules in place , then we have ""segments of tourism being open tht conflict with the state of emerg....eg, the group of 5 must be from 1 household as opposed to a group of fisherman from several households. From her pov its a messed up confusing situation still. Make your phone calls, be patient with the owners. they are having a hard time deciphering what is allowed and what isnt."

6448798,Fisherman Ted,2020-06-05 15:29:00,461,"I talked to him directly. As did Laurie Marcil, Executive Director of NOTO. Its official.. -FT MORE GOOD NEWS! ...US Camp Owners Will Now be Permitted to Enter Canada! This just in from Canada Border Services Agency. Please read through it carefully and follow the recommendations for proceeding. We can't wait to welcome all of our US camp owners back. To our Valued Partners in Tourism, As you may have heard, the province of Ontario has allowed lodges, camps and cabin rentals to start reopening subject to safe protocols and restrictions. This only applies to Canadian guests as the border restrictions continue until June 21, 2020. Foreign Nationals who own a Canadian lodge/camp will be allowed to apply for a LMIA exempt work permit at the Ports of Entry, so long as their business qualifies to open and their intent is to operate for the summer of 2020. Once a work permit is issued, the Foreign National would be allowed to enter as an authorized worker, but will need to be able to self-isolate for 14 days at a designated address subject to public health quarantine rules. (Information will be provided when you arrive at the border) To facilitate a large influx of people seeking work permits we would like to have you contact the Port of Entry where you normally cross and they will direct you as to any changes in the process. In Fort Frances, where we issue the majority of camp owner work permits, we will be implementing a pre-screening process and be issuing the permits by appointment to handle the volume. I hope that by mutual respect and cooperation we can meet the needs of this large group of foreign workers and keep our backlogs to a minimum. We are also working to ensure the health and safety or our Officers and all of our clients in this challenging time. As a group of business owners you have been patient with the inability to attend to your place of business and I would ask for your patience over the weekend as we ready our processes to prepare for your arrival. We will be in a better position to accept your work permit applications next week and will start the scheduling of appointments after we review the information that you will be asked to provide. Thanks for your anticipated cooperation. Telephone number for our Ports of Entry are as follows: Rainy River POE  807-852-3341 Fort Frances POE  807-274-3655 Pigeon River POE  807-964-3000 Sault Ste Marie POE  705-941-3063 Kevin Begin Superintendent/Surintendant Canada Border Services Agency/Agence des services frontaliers du Canada Northern Ontario Region/Région du Nord de l'Ontario Fort Frances Port of Entry/Point d'Entrée Fort Frances 101 Church Street/101 rue Church Fort Frances, Ontario P9A 3X8 (807) -274-5426 cell (807) 275-6068 fax (807) 274-8416"
6448844,hoppy63,2020-06-05 17:25:00,367,I can assure those that can get tests are lucky....which I'm sure is out there. My friends mom just passed in a nursing home in Ohio and had symptoms for several days and could not get a test. Was told the workers could not get tests either. Now all of these BEAUTIFUL tests any one could get months ago are available for hundreds of $$$$$.......ill stop there.
6448846,v-bay gord,2020-06-05 17:43:00,3168,"I feel the love LoDo .thanks, we can agree on something!"
6448896,emma17,2020-06-05 19:58:00,436,"Awesome news Fisherman Ted. I'm thrilled for all camp owners/operators. I'm one of those Americans that will do my part to bring you business this year- scheduled for mid-September, first time fall fishing."
6449024,Obabikon,2020-06-06 08:53:00,2370,These are all positive steps in the right direction. We are all hoping this is pointing towards an open border
6449032,TritonEbbs,2020-06-06 09:15:00,16,Has anyone heard about entry of US residents who own cabins in Ontario? I have a place on Rainy Lake North Arm and am anxious as everyone else is to get up to my place Regards Brad
6449034,Hookhunter135,2020-06-06 09:15:00,129,I was very discouraged. My outlook for the season was grim. No steps seemed like they were being taken to open border. This is a very positive sign. Hopefully soon tourists will be welcome. I think both governments are starting to see that life needs to move on. A 6 month + halt to the economy is very unrealistic
6449046,Obabikon,2020-06-06 10:49:00,2370,They can not cross yet.
6449098,Esoxmike,2020-06-06 13:53:00,114,"All of Canada or just Ontario allowing us lodge owners up,just asking for the fellas hoping to get to quebec and other provinces"
6448482,BreezyPoint,2020-06-05 00:35:00,1581,You need a doctor's order to get a Covid test. Many take 48-96 hours. A system of tests like Alaska suggests seems pretty much untenable.Frank
6448504,Bstar,2020-06-05 04:59:00,564,"There's a lab near me that will test you with results in 1 1/2 hours for $260, no doctors referral needed. Or $130 if you can wait 24-48 for your results. There are other urgent care clinics in my area offering tests with no referrals needed."
6448514,BornToFish,2020-06-05 05:29:00,1224,"Greetings,I checked with my doctor's office yesterday about getting documented lab results within 72 hours of my departure. Since I leave my home on a Monday afternoon, that means having the test over the weekend, AND THEN getting documentation of the results on Monday morning. The nurse did not laugh at me, but certainly did not sound optimistic. She said she would look into it for me.The lodge owner advised that the harbor master will check our body temperature and document the results of the test in a log book. The lodge owner did not say what happens to the test results - shared with a governmental agency for example.It seems to me that traveling through four airports and three flights on the way to the fishing lodge may be a bit like living in a petri dish. The week long stay at the fishing lodge may be akin to an incubation period. If people in our group have an elevated body temperature when they are checked on their way home by the harbor master, I'm fairly sure they will be denied air travel to return home. Is travel by rental car to return home practical, or even possible (i.e. border closure)?Where would infected people stay in Alaska while self-quarantining before they can return home? I doubt that a hotel or the fishing lodge would take in an infected person. I'm not aware of alternatives for a place to stay while self-quarantining, other than a hospital.I'm sensing a trap with respect to the way things are evolving when traveling to Alaska. This entire matter of traveling to Alaska seems to be coming down to the line from Clint Eastwood's movie: ""do I feel lucky?"".Kindest regards...."
6448590,rosh1,2020-06-05 07:42:00,275,Glad to here lodges can start. Told my wife to keep packing the border will be next. I think they will just come out with very little warning that the border will open. Think if they give a long notice ahead of time border will be overwhelmed. How many other cottage owners out there are packed and ready?
6448594,Obabikon,2020-06-05 07:44:00,2370,"I believe the next step is US citizens that are Canadian business owners and immediate family members who have been separated. That will be the ""soft"" opening side of it. They'll let those people in, and then the next step will be tourism. But... that's just a guess. I can tell you that the Canadian Government is taking a BUNCH of heat for the way they informed resorts that they could open.... basically with a few hours notice."
6448598,rosh1,2020-06-05 07:48:00,275,Agree the business owners should be the first. Glad its starting.
6448628,Fisherman Ted,2020-06-05 08:52:00,461,"If only everyone could see behind the scenes and what a BLEEP SHOW this has been. There is a reason why they announced to the sector with just a few hours notice and its all because the government screwed this up in the first place. NOTO (one of the key industry advocacy groups) told the government like 6 weeks ago that they needed to further define the rules and let the province know explicitly. They of course didn't and what happened was Premiere Ford made it worse by hinting that there might be a regional approach to opening. Well by saying that things went from bad to worse. Now localities decided to make the call on their own interpreting the law/state of emergency and who could open and how. And each interpretation was a little different than their neighbors. So the health units started to give the blessings to operators and in turn told OPP the same. So now OPP (the Provincial police) starts shooting things out into the media saying we are good to go in some areas, closed in others. All the while the Provincial rules still trumped everything. And lodges started to open up. And then the province called the municipalities and shut them down. I have seen maybe a dozen lodge postings on social media announcing they were open only to retract within days or even hours. It was the Wild West and the provincial government was nowhere to be found. Operators saw their neighbors opening and said hey, if they can open so can we! What a mess. So just a few days ago NOTO got right to the minister of Tourism for the Province to let them know the horse had left the barn. And they HAD to make an announcement and lead the province. With one voice. And within 12 hours they did just that and announced the opening at least internally with various restrictions etc. But at least it was a decision for all which is what we needed in the first place. -FT"
6448730,v-bay gord,2020-06-05 12:38:00,3168,"Interesting Ted....thank you. It's important to note the role of NOTO in this and how critical they are to the industry. What pisses me off is many of those whining and complaining now have never paid a membership to NOTO or cared to join in any organization. The time will come, I hope, when every lodge will be required to pay a membership as part of being in tourism.....bring back the tourism license!!!"
6448736,LoDo,2020-06-05 12:48:00,721,V-bay!!! We've disagreed on this thread more than once but I'm 100% with you on the NOTO comment. Spot on!
6448770,Fisherman Ted,2020-06-05 14:20:00,461,The border has just announced that starting Monday they will be allowing US lodge owners across into Canada to get to their camps. -FT
6448280,Obabikon,2020-06-04 12:24:00,2370,"This is from NOTO... seems like yesterday's release was inside info that wasn't official yet. However, Ontario is opening, but the border is not yet."
6448284,v-bay gord,2020-06-04 12:42:00,3168,Saw that as well. It's a start.
6448306,walleyecheek,2020-06-04 13:40:00,2231,I didn't hear anything come down from the wire from Doug Ford ?
6448316,pike50plus,2020-06-04 13:56:00,584,any border crossing update?
6448322,Obabikon,2020-06-04 14:12:00,2370,"No. Nothing at all on the border has been released. However, the fact that these things are happening leading up to June 21 is a good sign. Previously, we were pretty sure that the border wasn't going to open because they had taken zero steps. Now, it is looking more promising. Even if it gets pushed a little more... if things don't take a bad turn, it will be opening this summer."
6448346,KevinSB,2020-06-04 15:08:00,73,"Good start. We're holding out hope that our August trip (rescheduled from June) will be a go. While I'd love to have a trip this year, my convenience is less important in the grand scheme of things. Just know that another WC member is thinking of camp owners and others affected financially by COVID. Kevin"
6448364,Hookhunter135,2020-06-04 16:03:00,129,This is very positive news. It’s a step in the right direction for sure. Give me hope for September now.
6448366,Pooch,2020-06-04 16:11:00,4618,Our June 27-July 4 trip was cancelled by our camp. They said the border closure had been extended to June 30. I was hoping the June 21 opening date would hold. Feel like a five year old who just found out that Christmas was cancelled! :-) Pooch
6448452,BornToFish,2020-06-04 20:02:00,1224,"Greetings, I received today an email from a fishing lodge in Alaska that I am scheduled to go to in August. Alaska recently put in place a number of conditions in order for someone to enter Alaska. Here is an excerpt from the email that addresses one of the conditions:1. The traveler produces a SARS-CoV2 PCR test result showing the traveler tested negative for COVID-19 within 72 hours before departure to Alaska; OR 1. The traveler produces a SARS-CoV2 PCR test result showing the traveler tested negative for COVID-19 within five days before departure to Alaska and the traveler obtains a second SARS-CoV2 PCR test upon arrival in Alaska and minimizes interactions until the second test result is received and that test is also negative;I wonder if Canada might put in place something similar for Americans to enter into Canada? Kindest Regards...."
6448456,bthomas3333,2020-06-04 20:18:00,465,Im headed to Alaska too. Makes a ton of sense. I really don't understand why this hasn't been at least discussed as a way to allow Americans to visit.B
