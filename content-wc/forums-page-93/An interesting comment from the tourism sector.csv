6448976,78dave,2020-06-06 06:34:00,53,Went to Totem last year and we paid the tip in US funds - checked back with staff and they paid them in CA and pocketed the difference - pitiful
6448986,That Minnesota guy,2020-06-06 06:53:00,8293,"No matter the lodge policy I tip directly to the person I want to tip. Went Salmon fishing to Alaska once. They instructed us all tips went into one pot and would be split at the end of the season. I tossed a $10 spot into that pot and tipped the cooks, camp boys and my guide on my own. Those camp kids worked their asses off for us. No way was I not making sure they knew I noticed that."
6448994,phishfearme,2020-06-06 07:07:00,1242,"big daddy is right on the mark - Canada (and Europe and Asia) is so far ahead of the US in making cash un-necessary. we've stopped bringing any Canadian $$ for many years now with no issues - even buying a drink or candy bar at a convenience store you can use credit cards. and although many outfitters we use still do not take credit cards, we've been able to do bank transfers - in US or Canadian $ - at minimal if any costs. phish"
6448996,pjshorthorn,2020-06-06 07:07:00,5654,"Wait. What ? Stolen ? You get one job to do .....to protect the flock at all costs and you are down to one stinking bird ? WTF ( What The Flamingo ) is going on up there for cripes sakes ? I suppose all the bouy markers were chopped up in the props of the your armada and you're too embarrassedTo admit that your navigational skills have seriously declined over this past spring after ice out. Well, my mission is now clear. And BTW.....$10 US dollars per bird is total . That doesn't even cover one grooming session for a bird. PjShorthorn"
6449110,gopherbuddy,2020-06-06 14:57:00,51,Dalseg's Grocery Store in Nestor Falls does not accept credit cards. They seem to be a rare exception.
6449202,BuckeyeATC,2020-06-07 05:38:00,88,"Just a couple of thoughts for everyone complaining about the exchange, using dollars in Canada etc... We have cabin in NE Ontario and never use US dollars in Ontario because we usually use the credit card, which gives you the current exchange automatically or we got to an ATM in Ontario and get some Loonies. Yes there is an international withdrawal fee, but it beats getting screwed on the exchange when you use US dollars in Canada. Just my 2 cents."
6449578,MN_Moose,2020-06-08 07:05:00,964,Do you notice that Dalseg's has two cash drawers? One for Canadian funds and one for American? No problem I guess. They do a conversion.
6449786,Obabikon,2020-06-08 10:25:00,2370,"That isn't an exchange rate issue. That would be simply an immoral practice. They are taking 30% of their staff's tips. Our staff gets the tips exactly the way they're given. They can handle the conversion on their own if they wish. This is not a conversion issue. This would not be taking advantage of the exchange. This would simply be an owner taking tip money from his employee. That said... there's a chance that they are taking the extra money, and giving it to the dock hand as a tip... or it is their way of making the guides tip out other employees. (much like a waitress has to tip out the kitchen staff). I don't know. However, if they are simply taking the money... that is a very immoral practice. However, they could just as easily take 30% of a Canadian tip as they could take 30% of a US tip."

6449920,bus33,2020-06-08 14:16:00,289,Well that answered my question of how much of an outfitters/lodge's business is American vs Canadian visitors.
6448384,walleyecheek,2020-06-04 17:35:00,2231,Heres another thing that i dont get. (Well i get it) you or i go to the grocery store in lets say Kenora and lets say the exchange rate is .30 cents on the dollar in US favor ? You proceed to the check out and your bill is 10.00 US. You give them a 20 ((US) and they hand you back a 10 (Canadian) wait WHAT ?????
6448386,That Minnesota guy,2020-06-04 17:36:00,8293,"It shouldn't be a problem if the resort wants to charge in US either. Cripes, it's their business, if they want to charge in goats or chickens either pay that or go elsewhere. We are nearing a deal (I think) with our guy to pay in Pink Flamingo's. Well at least thats the goal. I believe he has done it in the past because I saw a big flock of them last time I was there."
6448398,Eckohlt,2020-06-04 17:57:00,3685,I tried to pay with chickens one year but I couldn't get them across the border
6448420,v-bay gord,2020-06-04 18:35:00,3168,"Most of my pink flamingo's have died of old age, or been stolen. I'm left with one or two lonely samples. On a serious note, with the notice of reopening to Canadian travel only, it might be wise for those that want to cater to Canadian business to at least have a Canadian $ price list. One pink flamingo = $10 US dollars which is about $650 Canadian...."
6448490,Eckohlt,2020-06-05 03:12:00,3685,When can I put my order in for the flamingo at 650$canadian that's a steal?
6448592,Obabikon,2020-06-05 07:42:00,2370,I always think that's annoying too. I think it's just a way for the business to make more money. Heck... they Canadian Tire in Fort Francis accepts US currency at PAR. I just simply don't go there anymore.
6448596,prov1800,2020-06-05 07:48:00,5010,Well at least we accept your money.Your country doesnt want ours.Just bring cdn money or use a credit card.We always bring US cash on our trips to US.
6448622,bigdaddyguns,2020-06-05 08:41:00,608,No reason to carry foreign currency. Even in NWO every business I have stopped at from Fort Francis to Red Lake accepts credit card payments. For my fishing trips into Canada converting to local currency has been unnecessary and lose-lose situation from a conversion processing fee and and time delay/loss perspectives. Unless there is a direct payment requirement for local currency I don't see any benefit.
6448866,fergiefish,2020-06-05 18:37:00,197,"I do carry enough American dollars for emergency purposes. I do not care what the exchange rate is as I am in Canada doing one of the things I hold most dear; experiencing the peace and quiet of the lake and the beauty she provides. The fishing, beauty, and friendly people are all I need to remind me that being there is a great gift, and if things cost me a bit more, it will never be an issue for me."
6448880,prov1800,2020-06-05 19:04:00,5010,Sounds like you love our country as much as we do.It is a awesome place to live.In case you havnt heard they are going to allow camp owners to come to there camps so thats a plus.Keep your fingers crossed.
6448000,Obabikon,2020-06-03 16:00:00,2370,"You would charge in whatever makes it easier for your customers, or you would risk losing your customers to someone more accommodating. No business makes more or less because they charge in one currency vs. another. Right now the exchange rate is $1.35. If you have $135 dollars canadian and I have $100 US... we have the same amount of value. Tomorrow if the exchange rate drops to $1.20... and you still have $135 Canadian... you have more money than I do... because the exchange moved in your favor. If the exchange moves to $150... I have more money than you. Resorts that charge in Canadian and resorts that charge in US understand what they are charging prior to setting their prices. If they can predict what the exchange rate is going to do... then they are in the wrong business. They can make much more money playing the international exchange market. All that said... here is an email that I received that is more on topic.Quote: Hi everyone, I received this news from Inspector Jeff Duggan at the OPP just a few minutes ago: Please see below:The OPP has informed us that drive-in lodges and other shared drive-in accommodations across the region can now open their cabins up for rent to vacationers and not just essential workers and those self-isolating.This, however, does NOT apply to seasonal campgrounds - no overnight campers are allowed as of yet. Only people with seasonal contracts are allowed as per before.However, it is critically important to remember that there are conditions and that lodges can only provide accommodations and not necessarily other services - please see below:> Operators are responsible for ensuring social distancing guidelines are followed by guests> Limit of 5 people per cabin (unless from the same household)> Amenities such as fitness rooms, communal recreation rooms, restaurants etc. must remain CLOSED> Those who can ARE allowed to provide food service (curbside pick-up or delivery to the cabin) - no restaurant or patio service is allowed at this time> You CANNOT rent a boat to or provide guide services the guests staying at your resort - however if the person brings their own boat, they can go fishing and pay for dockage as marinas are allowed to openWe received this info from Inspector Jeff Duggan of the Kenora OPP Regional Headquarters. Inspector Duggan says if any lodges have questions regarding this, you should call your local OPP Detachment.This is good news for some and we realize, not for others but it's a start at least. Just act responsibly under the guidelines and do your best to follow them and you won't have any issues!"
6448034,Obabikon,2020-06-03 17:38:00,2370,And the glorious follow up email... I can't understand why there's so much confusion with how well we are communicated with.
6448040,walleyecheek,2020-06-03 17:43:00,2231,Yeah i wouldn't think that kind of information would come from the Police Department ?
6448064,Pooch,2020-06-03 18:42:00,4618,"My wife and I travel to Canada, Mexico, Bahamas and Turks & Caicos. All of the rentals in all of those countries rates are quoted in USD. I just don't see the problem whose currency I use. The USD is about the most stable currency in the world and is nearly universally accepted. When we travel I always carry and use the currency of the country we are currently in, but many want USD for payment of everything from groceries to trinkets. I don't see the point of yelling at Canadian camps over the currency used. As a traveler, I will use whatever currency owners want to pay my way. It just does not matter to me either way. Pooch"
6448106,prov1800,2020-06-03 21:43:00,5010,Most camps are owned by americans and when they started buying camps here they changed it to US dollars from canadian dollars.Rest of canada is still all canadian.But if you work at a camp you get payed in canadian.
6448126,Jesse-WI,2020-06-03 22:26:00,534,THIS!!! If you do not like the price and/or currency just go else where.
6448142,Eckohlt,2020-06-04 03:40:00,3685,I just grab a handfull of hundred dollars bills and take off figure that should cover it

6448380,alanexpup,2020-06-04 17:22:00,278,"When we were kids all the places charged in Canadian money because back then their money was worth 20% more than ours,1950s. And the stores would take U.S. money but they wanted the difference in value in addition even if it was only a couple penny’s. Then a few years later ours was worth a couple penny’s more and when buying something in U.S. funds the business would never refund the difference in value. Then when we started going to Canada with our kids some places charged in canadian funds and some charged in U.S. funds. Now it seems like they ALL want to be paid in American money. Do they give the local Canadians a discount I have to wonder and screw the rich americans??? We started searching for places that bill in canadian funds and would just go to them. It should not be our problem that their dollor fluctuates negative to the dollor."

6447852,emma17,2020-06-03 09:16:00,436,"Your comment about political representatives letting tourism fall through the crack actually gives me great hope. In the US the risk to nursing home residents fell through the crack, likely because the immediate focus during the initial spike in cases was for the general population. A slowing of the crises allows representatives time to zoom out and see more of the picture. I have great hope that this is happening now for Ontario."
6447882,johnboat,2020-06-03 11:07:00,2014,"I can't help but think the huge deciding factor in opening the border to everyone has to do with the fact that the Canadian government will be left holding the bag regarding the medical bills. In the US and many countries, our personal deductable and insurance companies cover the charges.No chance Canada is going to open any border risking non- residents infecting their citizens whose medical bills they have to pay for.I'm not trying to start an argument over the differences in the way our countries are run, I'm just saying it's got to come into play.I may be wrong as I do not know exactly how medical expenses are handled.I just hope it's sooner than later and for the best for everyone."
6447898,bthomas3333,2020-06-03 11:39:00,465,I don't understand why they don't use the same model Alaska is implementing as of June 5. If you want to visit and not quarantine you need to show a valid negative COVID test from within 3 days. If you can show that...WELCOME to Alaska.Why cant Canada do the same thing? Brett
6447900,bus33,2020-06-03 11:43:00,289,"I agree but the problem with that is finding a test that can get results back to you within 3 days. It would be pretty tough to plan a trip, plan a test, hopefully get the test back within 3 days, then go."
6447974,Fishquest,2020-06-03 15:23:00,89,"Amen Brother.....rates for a holiday in Canada should be charged and advertised in Cdn dollars. Being Canadian that rate can change quickly on a trip when converting to US dollars for us. If a trip costs 1300 US dollars right now at current rate that trip will run me $1820 Cdn dollars and if our dollar dips it goes higher. That's eating up a huge chunk of my monthly pay so I shop for outfitters who will give me a set price in Cdn dollars for my group. If they wont then on to the next one and it will bite them this year on attracting Canadian fisher people to pick up the slack in business. What bothers me even more is when Canadian owners of outfitters charge in US dollars, seems greedy to me. Just my opinion but after 30 + yrs of tripping I can have one and share it around the world wide web."
6447980,walleyecheek,2020-06-03 15:36:00,2231,"I've said this for years........ If you own a Business, resort, whatever in CANADA you charge in Canadian funds !!!!!

6447286,phishfearme,2020-06-02 06:01:00,1242,this continues to confuse me - are you saying that outfitters who have their prices listed in US$ will not / can not convert CAN$ for you?? REALLY? to me this is like saying we only measure fish in inches and cannot use centimeters. phish
6447294,MikeF,2020-06-02 06:50:00,895,"Is it the value of stability the reason they want US dollars and they use that as a yearly benchmark? I would think this would only work if you stuff the mattress with US currency. The exchange rate gives the value of the day for each currency. Maybe the actual number when converting Canadian vs US currency sounds like a poor value or higher cost to Canadians? Today it is .74 to 1.00, about what it was last Sept. Earlier this year it was down to .64 to 1.00 but it has rebounded . Never understood this conundrum."

Who's picture is on the dollar has nothing to do with it."

That always cracks me up, and is why I take a few hundred CAD when I go."
6447312,bthomas3333,2020-06-02 07:31:00,465,"If the Canadian Lodges charge in USD the price of the trip is fixed for 95% of their customers. American(USD) guys know in October what the price of their trip will be in June. The lodge takes the hit when the exchange rate moves. How happy would 95% of their customers be if they told you the trip cost 1500CAD which is 1200USD in October when you show up and your trip is 1400USD.As someone who has worked extensively in Canada I fight like heck to get paid in USD for the same reason only in reverse. I have seen contracts that paid xxx,xxx USD(equivalent) over six months turn into xxx,xxx - 15,000USD for 6 months when the exchange rate moves. BTW. This is the risk we are putting on the lodges when they charge in USD. They could see their 20% margin turn into a 5% margin just because they are absorbing the risk.B-"
6447322,MikeF,2020-06-02 07:54:00,895,"Ok, that makes sense Sounds like the stability of value on the US dollar is the driver in wanting US funds. Outside of vacation trips to Canada, I have not had much dealings with the currency values so I was just guessing the reason(s)."

It's one outfitter providing a lot of jobs, and putting a lot of money into the local community. There are plenty of others of various sizes that also contribute to the local economy. It's irritating that our political representatives seem to have let tourism fall through the cracks during this event. I would hope that some direction comes soon and a solution that will keep most business's afloat for what seems to be a lost season."
