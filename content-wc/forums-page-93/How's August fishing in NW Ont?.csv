6439858,Hewhocookstomuch,2020-05-16 14:20:00,66,"Pull the trigger called Delta Airlines to cancel my flights from Virginia to Minnesota. After a sixteen hour wait, they returned my call at five AM. everything went smooth, I now have credit for two more years for another flight I hope our August trip via Slate Falls will be a go. Heading to Lake Saint Joseph. To answer your question about fishing in August. LSJ I believe would have great fishing year round.You might have to experiment and do a little tweaking. Should be great.:"

6445820,eyecatcher1,2020-05-29 16:39:00,323,I agree! I've been going up there for 28 years from opening day until early October and have had great fishing every trip.
6447104,gordy28,2020-06-01 18:10:00,437,"I am not sure we have fished true NW waters but almost all of our trips have been thr 3rd or 4th week of August We love it, little to no bugs, some warm days but cooler nights and fishing has always been good. Generally we have found the most success fishing humps, islands or points w sharp breaking drops. If you are interested search Ogoki Lake and the trip report breaks down how we did 3rd week in August in 2018 when it seemed like we had every weather condition Cheers Andrew"
6447350,Golden Eagle,2020-06-02 08:52:00,2642,"If I could make only 1 trip a year, it would be in August. The entire month of August. July 14 through end of August would be better."
6447354,prov1800,2020-06-02 09:08:00,5010,Most people have there favorite weeks to fish.Living in the Vermilion Bay and being a guide luts me in a different category when it comes to fishing.I guide at different camps on differents lakes. So as far as when is best id say from opener to end if season.Each month has its advantages.Early has a fantastic shallow bite.As season progresses and water temps increase you need to go somewhat deeper as fish move and as surface temps increase more they go deeper for the most part.Some never go deep and luve in weed beds that most fisherman wont fish and prefer sitting over a hump all day.But any month up here will and should produce the same results as any other month.Ive been fishing the last few weeks since to opener and have had fantastic results.which iam sure i will have in the next few months.
6438582,Eckohlt,2020-05-14 12:24:00,3685,RichA who the heck is giving 33% reduced rate that time of year may I ask?
6438596,MrSimon,2020-05-14 12:55:00,922,"Walleye and pike definitely can be deep in August .... but not always!! Creek mouths, current areas, and nice green weeds will always hold fish. Also, depending on how far North you go, the water might not heat up enough to drive all the big fish deep."
6438624,prov1800,2020-05-14 13:58:00,5010,So is fishing good in August.well of course it is.Fishing is good from the 3 rd Saturday in May till freeze up.Few different techniques required through the months but each month is unique in its own way.And as someone else mentioned there not always deep either in the hot weather months.For guys that usually come early here to fish but cant.............and decide to come later whenever that is they will have to change their game a bit and really use there electronics.Will also have to relearn the lake as it will be a totally different look and feel as compared to earlier in the spring.New adventures are fun.

6439198,Tbayfisher,2020-05-15 08:56:00,31,"August is fabulous fishing, fish in my home waters are out on the reefs and mid lake humps. August rocks, and when the water temp drops the fish really get on the bite"
6439230,wmd,2020-05-15 09:39:00,388,I have a friend who guided 4 summers in Canada while he was in college. It was in the Sioux Lookout area his opinion was August was the best fishing of the summer. wmd
6439614,The tank,2020-05-15 19:17:00,340,I've pretty much fished about every week from opening week to mid September. My favorite time is mid july to 3rd week in August. Everything is more consistent. For us we fish some what deeper in August. Pull mostly spinner rigs or gun drop floaters in August where as mostly jig in june. 13-25 feet is the norm. .7-1.2 mph works well.
6439672,rockpt,2020-05-16 00:51:00,589,Lots of great tips for August fishing. I've avoided mid to late August on LOTW cause of the algae bloom which seems to screw up everything. By mid September into October the lake has turned and the fall fishing has turned on.
6439684,The tank,2020-05-16 01:53:00,340,I've had some my best days on LOW under the thick pine dust in august. Find the bays with the thickest and fish under it the waters cooler and walleyes can be stacked under it. Just gotta sweep the green away before you net them. You know the reason it's the thickest is the wind blowing it in the bay. Its sun cover and wind swept. Can asked for much better. LOW has become my favorite lake. Big crappie opening week and big walleye and great musky fishing and walleye fishing in july -august. We missed the opener this year we may try that late September this year.
6438114,Willyboy123,2020-05-13 19:25:00,73,Well...it looks like our early June trip isn't going to happen. So we're thinking about going in August (assuming the border is open by then). Who has experience going that time of year? Is it any good then? We usually go a bit north of the Sioux Lookout area. Thanks!
6438304,Eckohlt,2020-05-14 05:37:00,3685,I can tell you fish don't stop feeding even in august go for it
6438318,eyecatcher1,2020-05-14 05:53:00,323,I have fished the Sioux Lookout area in August and the fishing has been great!
6438376,Bill Krejca,2020-05-14 07:23:00,6107,"Can be good,again depending on where you are. More fish seem to be deep, in my experience. My main dislike can be very hot weather, sun beating down. This year it may be how crowded it is out on the water!! Bill"
6438418,RichA$1970,2020-05-14 07:58:00,1159,"I have only gone once in August north of Red Lake and it was in the 90s all week. Fish were deep and it was ok, but probably my least favorite time. I booked in January for September 12 at the All Canada Show and they gave us a 33% discount as it is dead then for their fly ins so it is looking pretty good at this point hopefully."
6438432,LoDo,2020-05-14 08:10:00,721,"Late Aug!! I've had great success in LATE Aug. Fish are deep. Depending on where you go, you'll be fishing 20-30' for eyes. Northern are down there too. Lakers are far deeper and we didn't fish for them. Less bugs, less crowds. I prefer Aug over July, but June over both. Best of luck!!"
6438444,BornToFish,2020-05-14 08:41:00,1224,"Greetings, My favorite month of the year to fish in NW Ontario is September. August is close on the heels of September. August is my best month of the year in terms of numbers and size of walleyes. As others have already commented, I am routinely fishing in 25-30 fow for walleyes in August. I favor off-shore rock humps that have access to relatively deep water (e.g. 40+ fow). Boat control is extremely important when fishing in August - even more so than other times of the season, at least in my opinion. Many anglers find that boat control and vertical jigging is just too difficult when fishing in 30 fow, thus prefer to fish at other times of the season. The lakes that I have fished in NW Ontario typically reach peak water temperature in mid-August. Thus, water temperature and weeds are typically declining in the latter weeks of August. With this in mind, August is often a month of transition in terms of depth that walleyes are using. I typically find that walleyes are bunched up in the water column during early August, as lake temperature is nearing its maximum for the season. That is, I might find a lot of walleyes in 27 fow, as the water temperature, light and dissolved oxygen levels are optimum at that depth. There will be few fish in 25 or 29 fow. This is why boat control can be extremely important! Water temperatures are typically declining in late August, such that the temperature gradient from the surface of the lake is not as steep as in early August. In other words, the walleyes might find their comfort zone in a broader range of depths - e.g. 24 -30 fow. There is one other pattern that has worked well for me in August. This pattern involves finding a weed bed that is fairly near deep water. I've found that the walleyes will move into the weeds as dark approaches. I find them in deep water an hour or so before dark and follow them right up to the edge of the weeds as dark approaches. Again, I believe that August is a great time of the year to target walleyes in NW Ontario. Boat control and willingness to fish in ""deep water"" are keys to my success in August. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
6438502,Spadman101,2020-05-14 10:01:00,3,"Over the last 20 years I have had the opportunity to fish all of the Canadian provinces and I typically book (2) fly in trip a year. My 1st choice is always August and my 2nd choice is September, here is why I prefer those months: Walleye: The larger fish have moved out to the deeper reefs in 20 to 30 foot of water. Find the offshore reefs and the walleyes will be there. Upsize to 3/8"" jig to maintain bottom contact. Pike: The trophy sized pike move offshore and prefer the deep cooler water. I troll large deep diving minnow baits across submerged reefs in 30 to 40 foot of water that is surrounded by much deeper water. Lake Trout: Much easier to catch than most people think in the summer. Use your electronics and find the suspended bait fish in 50 to 200 foot of water. Use dipsey divers and troll until you catch a few trout and then go back and vertical jig then using shimano butterfly jigs. The trout are stacked up in the deep holes and are very aggressive at this time of year. The biggest challenge I think people will have that typically fish in June vs August is that they need to move away from the shoreline and use their electronics to find that underwater structure and don't be afraid to fish that vast open water."
6438548,Golden Eagle,2020-05-14 11:20:00,2642,"My favorite time to fish in NW Ontario is from mid July to mid August. During hot weather I give moving water a chance, check for walleyes in fresh/clean cabbage where there's sufficient O2, and also fish wind driven points and islands. Find walleyes, then move into slightly shallower water where big pike will be hanging around, waiting for a walleye to move toward them. Throw a big bait to the 5' to 10' water on a hump to give a big pike a chance to eat it."
6438578,jackpotjohnny48,2020-05-14 12:18:00,153,"I'm going to agree with what was written here, specifically the part that says, ""don't be afraid to fish that vast open water."" I have been fishing the deep, clear oligotrophic lakes for the past several years, and my preferred timeframe is actually the first or second week of August. The key thing to remember, at least on the trout lakes, is that the primary forage is ciscoes. In August, the ciscoes have moved into deep water, in order to find their preferred temperature range. And when the ciscoes head for deep water, so do the walleyes, pike, muskies, and smallmouth.... BUT.... The larger gamefish are not laying on the bottom in 100 feet of water. Rather, they are suspended anywhere from 10 to 25 feet down over the deep, open basin. Then, as the sun begins to set, the phytoplankton begins to rise off the bottom. The zooplankton then makes a vertical migration to feed on the phytoplankton. Finally, the ciscoes make a vertical migration to feed on the phytoplankton and zooplankton. When this occurs, the walleyes, northern, muskies, and bass as suspended, waiting for the ciscoes to move up in the water column. We usually begin fishing at about 8 pm at night in early August, and fish until about 2 am or 3 am the next morning. The best tactic is trolling crankbaits, either on planer boards or hand holding the rods and ripping like jerkbaits. We work the baits anywhere from 3 feet under the surface to about 20 feet under the surface, in water that is 70 feet deep to 140 feet deep. Last year, we caught most of our walleyes 12 feet down, in water that was 85 to 110 feet deep, and the vast majority of fish were caught between about 8 30 pm and midnight. When we go in August, we always spray our clothes with Sawyer's Permithrin bug spray about 2 or 3 days before leaving for Canada, and then let our clothes dry on a clothesline for a day. Also, we bring a mosquito suit, complete with mesh hood. Our best night last year, we ended up catching 3 different 29 inch walleyes, 2 28 inchers, and a 27 incher, as well as 6 other ""smaller"" walleyes. Not bad for one boat on August 13, 2019. Attached is a 10 minute clip from Lindner's Angling Edge, which explains how this tactic works. It is absolutely my favorite way to walleye fish....
