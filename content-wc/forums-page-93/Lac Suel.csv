6449406,Pooch,2020-06-07 18:48:00,4618,"That is a whole lot of water to make up this summer. Better start raining soon! We've had more than our share the past two years here in Central Illinois. Would gladly have shared it with you. Now the hurricane hitting and pushing moisture up the Mississippi Valley is gonna make us even more wetter....Lets see... what else can contribute to a ""peach of a year"" so far?Thanks,Pooch"
6449414,prov1800,2020-06-07 19:08:00,5010,Yes some camps have shallow water to begin with and have problems when water drops.Will probably be low now for rest of year.unless it pours like last fall.Just have to be extra carefull and stick to your save routes and dont get cocky.I have had to oppurtunity to fish all sections of Lac Suel and could make the trip to siouxlookout from earfalls.
6449464,rather-be-fishin,2020-06-07 22:34:00,429,"WOW!!! That is really low water!!! Thanks for sharing the pictures. I have never seen that much sand beaches there! I think I recognize that big rock & normally it is 3/4 or more underwater! First year I went to Lac Seul in 2003, the water was really low too. Haven't seen it that low since then. Still hoping & waiting to see if our fishing trip to Onaway will happen this summer. Crazy times! Stay well! RBF"
6449506,pjshorthorn,2020-06-08 04:46:00,5654,"Now that is the type of boat trip I could subscribe to !!!!!! When do you want to leave for Sioux Lookout ? I figure we could make it in about 3 hrs. If you want to take a side trip to the NE after we would pass Eagle Island, I could show you some super secret squirrel spots up in Kekabeka Narrows and beyond PjShorthorn"
6449514,prov1800,2020-06-08 05:31:00,5010,110 miles PJ and could do another 30 up to Chamberlain.Yes that rock stickes out of water a couple of ft normally.It will come up a bit now.lost of rain last night.wicked storm with tornado warnings.Next few day more rain.
6449314,prov1800,2020-06-07 14:12:00,5010,"Wife and I put boat in at Onaway Lodge yesterday.Pretty decent day out.Warm and cool and not very wi√±dy.Didnt fish far from camp.Slow bite but caught some fish.Basically shallow.Water temps at 56 F so pretty cold as i suspected.Figured be a slow bite but no big deal.Didnt want to run far like Broad Lake allthough Blair and Kathy from Onaway did go there and he said fishing was good.We caught enough to eat and got into a large school of perch and pretty much got one on each cast.Great sized ones 10-12"".Put a bunch of them in the cooler with the walleyes in the cooler on ice.Water levels are about as low as ive ever seen.Lot more real estate on the lake with a lot of beaches showing themselves.Was great going on some long hikes in the sand"
6449328,Eckohlt,2020-06-07 14:23:00,3685,Thought we see a pic of you sun bathing on that deserted beach
6449334,ackvil,2020-06-07 14:38:00,177,We were supposed to be there next week but with the border closed no luck. Anybody else there?
6449352,prov1800,2020-06-07 15:08:00,5010,2 boats we saw.local guys.i was supposed to be guiding there this week.Same crew as last year.we are all dissappointed.Totally sucks.
6449358,prov1800,2020-06-07 15:23:00,5010,To busy checking stuff out.Rod.It was kinda cool out with those cool water temps.but did manage to get a sunburn on my knee caps.
6449370,Eckohlt,2020-06-07 16:48:00,3685,"Man that looks like a nice beach for a stroll,low water can bring out some gems and also turn lakes into mine fields"
6449384,prov1800,2020-06-07 17:40:00,5010,Absolutely beautifull Rod.Lots of nuggets showing.but also many new ones just under the surface.
6449392,Pooch,2020-06-07 18:23:00,4618,So how far down is it from normal pool at this time of year? Earlier I thought you folks had good snow and spring rains. Pooch
6449396,prov1800,2020-06-07 18:31:00,5010,About 4-4 1/2 ft.water was super high in fall here. But lac suel drains all winter out of dam in earfalls.We did not have much snow this winter either.All lakes in the area are all low.Havnt had much rain either so far.
6449400,Stringbean,2020-06-07 18:40:00,279,"In checking the water level gauge at www.lwcb.com and going to basin data, your measurement is spot on. This will be another one of those summers where the camp owners will have to lay planks out to the boats. We went thru that one year about a decade ago."
