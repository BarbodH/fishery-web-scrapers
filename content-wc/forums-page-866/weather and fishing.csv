532257,bronzeback77,2003-06-12 15:26:00,97,We were up a week and half ago. Caught lots of Walleye in and around Sunset Channel and Yellow Girl. Weather was outstanding. We caught over 300 Bass in 7 days and had out limit of Walleye in the first 4 hours on the first day. The rest of the week was C&R. Mostly Jig and minnow over structure 25-40 ft. Good luck
532281,Guest,2003-06-13 00:40:00,0,last week we were at sioux narrows. Its odd that the water temp was 65 to 70 degrees and here in chicago the water is about 50. the walleyes were in 40 feet of water or deeper. bring them up slow or their air bladder ends up in their mouth. they die at the rapid trip up from that depth. yellow girl was it or even further west. It seemed like all the totem boats where heading west of yellow girl anyway. thats about an hours ride west of sioux narrows.
