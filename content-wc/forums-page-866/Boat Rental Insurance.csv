532391,Guest,2003-06-16 14:36:00,0,I never bought any but I think you might check the Information Centre at the Border Crossing if you are going in by way of Fort Frances. You might call ahead to see if it is available there or if they have a number of a company or agent.
532392,Wordly traveller,2003-06-16 15:28:00,9,I checked with my homeowner's insurance company last year prior to a trip to Canada. They routinely covered damage on a rental boat of 40 or less hp under the normal homeowner's policy. You might call your agent to see if yours will as well. Some outfitters also cover any damages on their policies (although I have seen internet sights indicating that all damages were the responsibility of the rentor). You might want to check with your outfitter as well. Good luck to you.
