Being from southern Wisconsin and having lived around the Mississippi River all my life, I know how bad a big hatch can be, as far as a mess. I have not however fished immediately before, during or after a hatch. I've heard many a stories about how at the beginning it is like catching fish from a barrel--Is that true? I've also heard how it just kills the fishing afterwards due to fish filling up on mayflies--Is that true? Also, around here I have seen mayflies the morning after a hatch six inches deep around light poles and have had them become almost impossible to drive through the night of the hatch. Are the hatches as dramatic around Canadian lakes. I'd be real interested in your first hand experience with mayflies as it relates to walleye and northern pike fishing. Thanks"

Up at Kabinakigami, the owner tells me he's had to use the backhoe to scoop all of them away from the shoreline and he gets a full scoop everytime. That's why I love going up in the second week of season, never had to mess with it."
