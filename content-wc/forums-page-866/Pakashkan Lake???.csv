532375,Guest,2003-06-16 08:50:00,0,I hope so! Thanks for the reply. I was not sure if there was anyone out there. Do you know of anyone that sells a decent lake map?
532407,Guest,2003-06-16 21:01:00,0,One of our Electrical suppliers puts on a little party there every year. I am fishing it this year with about a dozen of the boys. They do great every year. A depth map is available at the resort there.
