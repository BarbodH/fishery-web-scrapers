532382,Ivy,2003-06-16 10:22:00,556,What's the deal with the rock stacking. Is it some secret Canadian code? The taller the stack the better the fishng near by? I used to stack my beer cans back in college but never rocks. Is alcohol involved when you stack rocks? Is it a therapeutic? Ivy

532385,Guest,2003-06-16 10:36:00,0,They're called Inushuk. Inuits use them to mark the way. It's a sort of trail marker and now people just have fun making them.
532387,Guest,2003-06-16 10:43:00,0,Try this link. The same question was asked last year and this link seemed to provide some information.http://www.ricketkin.com/whatInnuk.html
532388,Minnow Man,2003-06-16 10:51:00,85,Rock stacking take the place of spray paint graffitti. It's your mark on the land and is usually left alone. Some folks do a great job building them. Mine has been standing for 5 years. Minnow Man

I asked my lodge owner's wife about them once, specifically the ones along highway's 105 and 502 and was told they were 'pee cairns'. That weary drivers would stop for a pee break and build a cairn to take a break from the road for a few minutes. I like the Inukshuk description much better! ...and if you're going to have grafitti, that's the kewlest kind to have. - Rick"
