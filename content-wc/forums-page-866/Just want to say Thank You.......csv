I've never had a better time fishing than when I'm up there and will always regard fishing in Canada as a great priviledge."

532322,jzstiff,2003-06-13 23:00:00,188,"When I'm in your country, I'll buy the beer. You ever get down to Michigan, be sure to stop in as I always have something on tap."
532344,Guest,2003-06-15 00:22:00,0,I must agree also 500 %. I alway thought its a good thing the americans did not get their hands on this land or it would be all screwed up. There is nothing wrong with having laws and following them with no exuses.
532369,Guest,2003-06-16 06:26:00,0,I agree. We leave next Saturday morning for our annual trip. One of the highlights is always the drive up. It is some of the most beautiful scenery in the world. Thanks for keeping it that way. Trout
532411,Guest,2003-06-16 21:41:00,0,"You know, I was in Canada last week. I go a couple times a year, being retired now. I love that country and the people in the camp I stay at. I don't care about political differences between nations ... at least not between us and them. Lake of the Woods is my escape from all my stressors. It reconnects me with all the things that are important in life -- at least as far as I am concerned. But, a very ironic and sad thing happened during my trip. I have made a lot of friends with the camp staff. They rehire a lot of the same people every year and I have gotten to know them very well. One of the kitchen staff said to me, ""You know, I finally understand what you Americans feel is so special about Canada and this lake. One of you took my out for my very first boat ride yesterday and that is the first time I ever saw the lake other than from a road. You are right. This truly IS a beautiful place and we are all lucky to have it."" I had assumed that she got out onto the lake or similar waters all the time. She had not. When I realized that, I felt pretty badly about not having taken her and the others in that kitchen for a boat ride myself. I have resolved to make up for it on my next trip. I feel like a heel for not having thought of it before."
