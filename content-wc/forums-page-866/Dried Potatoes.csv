532418,Guest,2003-06-17 07:21:00,0,"Some friends are planning on bringing some dehydrated scalloped potatoes with them on our upcoming Canada trip. They are the kind sold by food distributers to restaraunts. Is this going to be a problem at the border? I know this may be a stupid question, but I don't understand the whole ""potato problem"" anyway. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks, Matt"
