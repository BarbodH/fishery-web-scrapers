Is that the one that has a grocery plan for the week? It is about $1100 and they include all the groceries? If that is the resort it is good. A lot of fish and big ones too. I wasn't going to Canada when I worked with the guy so I didn't pay much attention to what he was using or where he was fishing for them, but I do remember him saying that he caught a lot of quantity and size. This report is a little vague but it gives you something to think about. Good luck this year. Fish 24/7"
