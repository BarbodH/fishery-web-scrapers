532354,Guest,2003-06-15 13:47:00,0,Just returned from Gullrock. We had fantastic fishing. It did not mater if the sun was out or if it was raining. The bite was on. Fish are all over the lake off the points an din the shalllows. We found fish 5 to 25 feet. Jigged the bottom. They really liked red jigs. Caught many fish 19-24 inches. No problem getting some to keep for dinner each day. Best fishing for us on Gullrock in 3 Years. I hope they keep bitting for you. Good luck!
532363,Guest,2003-06-15 20:19:00,0,Thanks for the info. Any particular areas?
532364,Guest,2003-06-15 20:55:00,0,"The hottest spots were - Ranger bay, fishermans point, three sisters, the mouth of Keg and stone bay area. People were getting fish on most of the points on the lake. We never fished the sunken island but we always saw people there every day so it must have been productive. Towards the end of the week the fish were starting to be suspended at about 12 to 16 feet in some area's. The water temperature on the lake was 64.5 and aroung 66/67 in the bays. Hope this helps you."
