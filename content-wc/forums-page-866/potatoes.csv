The customs agent said it must be some sort of joke, because potatoes can be brought into Ontario. He laughed and said I was the second person to ask him that question, but again he said potatoes are not a problem."

532320,Guest,2003-06-13 22:45:00,0,Instead of bringing in raw potatoes find a store that sells the 6 lbs of irish potates in a can. Sliced if you can find them They are precooked and easy to fry. All you need are the onions and fresh fried walleyes.
532321,jzstiff,2003-06-13 22:59:00,188,I crossed at the Soo last week and there wasn't a sign and nobody asked. I never knew about the tater thing and brought 40 lbs of taters.

532348,Guest,2003-06-15 07:24:00,0,"Got back last week. Crossed at Fort Francis and nobody asked us about potatoes when we got to the border. We brought potatoes with us and didn't know the difference. Besides the usual questions at the border, they did ask us about eggs though. I was glad we didn't bring eggs with us."
532352,Guest,2003-06-15 11:04:00,0,So what's the deal on eggs ... or was that a joke that I missed?
532356,Guest,2003-06-15 17:13:00,0,"No Joke!!!! You didn't miss anything. When I got to the border they asked if I had any eggs. I said ""no"" and that was it. It wasn't until I got home and read this board that I found out potatoes were the real culprit."
532360,Guest,2003-06-15 19:40:00,0,We just got back from Canada and crossed over at Baudette and they made us return to the US with our Potatoes. The US border had tables set out to put the potatoes on and go back over to Canada. We asked some other people at camp and they had to take theirs back to the US to. Talked to some that crossed over at International Falls and they had no trouble. I thought it was a hoax at first but others had to take theirs back also. [email protected]
532068,Guest,2003-06-08 20:02:00,0,Has any one heard of people haveing trouble getting potatoes acorss the boarder from the states. Someone mentioned this to me and didn't know what to think. Larry
532071,bigfish1965,2003-06-08 22:55:00,3210,Why not buy potatoes here? PEI potatoes are the worlds best anyway. Live a little.
532200,Guest,2003-06-11 17:46:00,0,"We went up and back thru Beaudette. Big sign that says NO POTAYOES. Saw them laying on a table, so they can't go in with ya!"
532202,Guest,2003-06-11 18:10:00,0,"we just returned saturday through baudette no potatoes allowed in ontario.but on the positive side we came home with 50lbs of free taters courtesy of the nice us customs agent that said to take all we wanted , they were sick of eating potatoes he hoped the next time it would be a ban on lobster lol.Maybe their is a mad potatoe scare?"
532203,Guest,2003-06-11 18:32:00,0,"I believe there is some type of fungis that is very easy to spread that they are worried about. Same deal trying to get into the U.S. with oranges from a different country, thats a no-no."
532205,Guest,2003-06-11 19:23:00,0,"If your a meat and potatoe guy better stay home, no potatoes in to Canada and no meat into USA!"
532240,Illini Bob,2003-06-12 10:31:00,16,"Were potatoes the only vegetable they were banning? Onions, peanuts, lettuce? It's not that we don't want to buy in Canada, it just takes away time we could be fishin'."
532243,Guest,2003-06-12 11:38:00,0,"Don't worry, I'm opening french fry stands on the US side of each customs checkpoint. Just drop your potatoes off at one of my stands."
532265,Guest,2003-06-12 17:29:00,0,"Excuse me, wouldn't those be FREEDOM FRIES. Please, please don't use the ""F""(rench) word on this board."
