I always carry a pocket-knife when I go fishing. Any advise here? Also, is it worth the hassle bringing crawlers over the border? I understand that they can't be in soil. How picky are the border officials? DennisS. Long Valley, NJ"

You probably will have a fillet knife in your tackle box as well. These are things that a border authority would expect a fisherman to have with him on a fishing trip. Canadian laws with respect to bringing crawlers in bedding material rather than in soil are simply laws to protect against the transport of disease, fungus, etc. across borders. Similar laws preclude the transport of live leeches from the US into Ontario unless one has a commercial bait licence. These aren't laws intended to harass fishermen but rather laws to protect natural resources. You can also visit the following web site to get more information about visiting Canada and some of the restictions. There are also telephone numbers there to get more information if required.http://www.ccra-adrc.gc.ca/E/pub/cp/...tml#P262_23216"

Only once (when we were in our suspicious twenties) have we ever been invited over for a complete search. The border authorities are just folks who appreciate courteous treatment and, as far as my experience goes, excercise common sense in dealing with gringos. Knives have never been an issue. You just might want to avoid bringing the Crocodile Dundee model at home. ""Now, THAT'S a knife!"" Actually, it's the return trip into the US that warrents concern, considering the events of 9-11. By the way, once in Canada, make sure you've got your seatbelts on. They'll stop you for infractions and you'll then have to pay the fine on the spot (no checks) or become a guest in their holding facility until the fine is paid. It can really put a crimp on your liquid assets. Two years ago were stopped twice near Maniwaki for a DWI road check. And for the last three years the Ontario Dept of Natural Resources has set up roadblocks near the border on our return home (the first week in July) checking coolers, licenses and such. The drug sniffing dog is thrown in at no extra charge. Hang on to your licenses until you get back in the states, especially if you're bringing back fillets. See you at O'Sullivan in late June. Be sure to look us up."
