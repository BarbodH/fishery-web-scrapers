532340,Guest,2003-06-14 19:47:00,0,How did you do up at Whitewater? How would the operation rank in comparison to other outposts you have been to recently? We're leaving in 3 weeks - a canoe trip this time.
532341,lobo1,2003-06-14 20:36:00,734,I would rate Mattice Lake Outfitters/Wabakimi Air as a first class operation - very professional. Really don't see how they could do things any better. As far as the camp on Whitewater Lake it is very nice and very well kept; The camp attendant is awesome; anything you want or need - consider it done. Whitewater lake itself is a little crowded for my liking; there are several camps on the lake. We ran the range of very fast fishing to one of our guys only getting one fish on one day. We did boat (and release) some big fish but we really are used to catching more with quite a bit less time fishing and travelling around looking for active fish. I would certainly use the outfitter again but would probably choose one of their single cabin lakes (just my preferance). Our overall experience.......I would say we had one of our best trips to date to this place. The excellent camp makes it worth the trip. You can certianly find much faster fishing elsewhere but there is a legitimate chance at a trophy pike or eye in this lake and you wont go hungry. lobo

I have changed all my security settings on my computer and have 2 new passwords but to no avail. The lakes are still navagable but just have to watch carefully in the shallow areas for rocks. We had no problem. There were some Ohio guys up there with a 150 hp and they had no problem. Bugs were not too bad either. We had a great trip. Caught lots of fish and kept a couple nice eaters every day for supper but left all the bigger fish swimming for ya--good luck."
531333,Birdhunter_007,2003-05-20 18:52:00,2,I have been lurking on this message board for a few weeks now. I have to say I am really impressed with the quality and integrity of this board. This is my first post here. I am leaving on the 30th for the Pickle Lake area for a week of fishing. I've been there before but not this early. Any fishing reports yet for that far north?
531334,lenray,2003-05-21 10:50:00,467,was on the Pipestone River system last year on May 25th. have a pic with snow knee deep.len in michigan
531335,Birdhunter_007,2003-05-21 17:50:00,2,"Thanks Len, I've been going up to Pickle Lake area last 2 years and really like the area. I haven't been down the Pipestone, but enjoy wilderness canoe trips. Last year we were up there June 8th and there was no sign of snow. The weather was great and the fishing was fantastic. What was your opinion of the Pipestone? I would be interested in hearing a little about your trip."
531336,phishfearme,2003-05-29 14:12:00,1242,birdhunter - we're flying outta pickle on june 28 to bow lake with albany outfitters. where you goin' and with whom? - phish
531337,Guest,2003-05-29 19:56:00,0,"I am leaving tomorrow a.m. and driving up to Pickle Lake area. In the past I have done a lot of canoe trips into the back country but never in the Pickle Lake area. A couple years ago, my canoe buddies backed out, so I just drove up to that area to check it out. I found the locals to be some of the friendliest people in the world and this will be my 3rd year in a row up there. I just camp at a small camp ground that the town set up on a lake the locals call Mud Lake. The walleye and pike fishing is good, but no nearby lake trout fishing. Someday I would like to try the canoe thing again and fly out of Pickle Lake area and hopefully find some of those famous speckle trout I read about. But until my buddies who don't mind roughing it a little can get their lives in order I will have to do my drive up fishing. I am excited--11 hours from now I leave. Al"
531338,Eyesore,2003-06-03 08:01:00,455,Let us know how you did-I'll be heading up in 2 weeks. Thanks
531339,Eyesore,2003-06-06 14:35:00,455,To the top
531340,Guest,2003-06-06 16:47:00,0,Hello birdhunterlet us know when you get back I will be going up in august or sept. you were at not sure of spelling--Badasdawa I think what they call Mud lake we go further north to the Pipestone the eye fishing was--as you don't know me and even if you did it would be difficult to believe what the fishing was and is. I had a guy with me a young 68 who had only caught one eye in his entire life we kept track for just one hour and put 52 in the boat not using a net because we were not trying to boat them we had another 30 come off before landing and numerous hookups that didn't break the surface.These were all males except for one female and the locals said wait until after the spawn and the girls would start hitting---what would that be 100 per hour or more.Saw many moose and some in the lake and the river. I got so tired of landing eyes that just let out enough line on the ugly stick so that I didn't have to reel and just dipped them out---WAY to many fish for me I like to catch a few and have some good quality time to think about my future but not with that kind of action.
532333,Eyesore,2003-06-14 14:46:00,455,Nice report. I hear the water levels are down this year on Badasdwa[Mud] as well as Menako. I'd like to know if they are still navagable in a small boat-14'/25hp? Also the rivers running in and out of these lakes. Headin' up in a week. Thanks in advance.
532337,lobo1,2003-06-14 18:19:00,734,Life's tough ain't it Len !! probly have a tough time selling that B.S. story but since I've been there I know what you mean. (I knew nobody would believe a fish on every cast so I video taped it.) We went out of Armstrong this year for a little more thinking time. Two things - 1) we got our thinking time 2) thinking time is over rated !! Was up to Jay's last week - made me think of ya. lobo1
