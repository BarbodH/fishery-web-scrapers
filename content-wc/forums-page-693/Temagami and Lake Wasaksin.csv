558972,LindyRigger,2006-06-29 21:07:00,36,I am taking our boy scout troop to Temagami in July. We will spend most of our time on Wasaksina and Denedus. Does anyone have any info or tips for fishing these lakes. We will be in canoes. We would like to target walleye and smallmouth. Any info would be appreciated. Thanks LindyRigger Scoutmaster from Ohio
