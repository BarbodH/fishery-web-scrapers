We intend on bringing ALL of our food, dry goods, frozen meats, milk & eggs, etc (no potatoes). We also intend on bringing 2 cases of beer each per person and will declare those and pay the duty. I would assume having a list makes the transition much smmother."
558909,Guest,2006-06-27 15:53:00,0,You don't need a list but it might help. When asked specific questions about what your bringing answer back to the customs agent by reading off the list you have.
558911,Crappie Kid,2006-06-27 16:02:00,1581,I just found this form:http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/E/pbg/cf/e311/README.html
558913,SSH,2006-06-27 16:43:00,526,"I have found over the years that you only respond honestly to the questions asked. I wouldn't recommend asking questions or offering any additional information. Designate one person per vehicle to respond to the border patrol. No handguns !!!!!!! A list of beer/tobacco would be helpful. A minimum is to know what your group is bringing in. 24 cans of beer, one liter of liquor or 40 oz of wine per person are allowed. If you have more that that per person, declare it and see if they make you pay duty on it. 200 cigarettes or 50 cigars are allowed per person. If you chew, 200 grams (7 oz) of manufactured tobacco or 200 tobacco sticks. My buddy a couple years ago asked about pepper spray. He will not ask any questions in the futureqWe got the third degree, but they didn't tear us down. The will more than likely ask if you have handguns/pepper spray. Live bait is not allowed except nightcrawlers in commercial bedding (no dirt)."
558915,Guest,2006-06-27 17:34:00,0,"The declaration card is used when traveling by air. I have gone to Canada every year since I can remember and we never made a list of the stuff we were bringing across. To be honest I think it might look a bit odd to be reading off a list to the customs agent. However, it might not be a bad idea to make a list of all the regulated items (alcohol, tobacco, weapons, potatos, etc) you are bring cross, so that you don't forget to mention them. A lot of people tend to freeze up and forget things or ramble on to much. The custom agents don't care about your underwear or what your eating on Monday night. Just answer the questions you are asked, don't ask the customs agent questions and declare anything that needs to be declared. If you do those three things you won't have a problem."
558922,Guest,2006-06-27 21:44:00,0,"We don't have a list, but we do have drivers license and birth certificates ready to show. We also know what duty items we have in the vehicle. The one thing we could have gotten burned on over the years is that we normally have 2 or 3 vehicles. By the time we get to the border, we have switched who is riding with whom. An individual's booze is possibly in another vehicle. We now make a point to make sure everybody's luggage and booze is in the vehicle they are riding in. Fritz"

I list anything that I could be taxed on, and include alcohol and tobacco regardless if I am over my limit or not. I also list things I will be bringing up and than back into the states. They seem appreciative. I have a copy for them, and a copy for myself. Also, be honest. I have a cabin up there and have brought across quite a bit of stuff. We have always been honest with them, and the amount we have had to pay in taxes is nothing in compaison to spending your time at the border while they break you down. Best of luck on your trip."
558933,wiggle,2006-06-28 07:40:00,400,"I would not use a list. It may bring a bit of suspicion if you don't know the answer without your ""list"". Here are some tips for you: if you are in a crew cab pickup, or suv and can roll down the rear windows. Do so right before before you get to the officer. They like to see everybody in the vehicle when possible. Do not wear sunglasses. If you drive a diesel, turn it off. They always ask for some kind of I.D. Drivers license will work, but bring a birth certificate along just in case. They are still banning potatoes. Be quick with your answers. Typical questions are, what is your country of origin, any alcohol, any tobacco, any live bait, any guns, where are you heading, what is your purpose in Canada, when will you be returning. Look straight at them, be quick and honest with your answers and you shouldn't have a problem. This also applies for coming back into the USA. They can be tough sometimes as well. Maybe even more so..... Brad"
