558870,Renn,2006-06-27 07:15:00,87,"Sifty, I would agree with you, the 'eyes should be a little deeper than they are in September. Last year was my first time fishing Gullrock in September and I was amazed at the amount of weight they put on in just a month! Jonnya83, It looks like some of the regulars are going to be in camp again this year!! I think we are going to start following you guys around this year. That was an interesting spot ""we"" were fishing Friday last summer. I didn't realize there was that kind of structure off that point!!! Pattee, Take it easy on the 'eyes while your up there!!! :-) My son has been telling me he can't wait to go to Canada since about March!! I think he has been infected with the ""fever"" also!!! It didn't help that Grant and Bev put his picture in the new brochure either!!! 38 days and counting!! Renn"
558878,Guest,2006-06-27 08:54:00,0,"renn, are you talking about the point in keg lake? i think thats where we were, i dont have my log book with me to check tho! if thats the one it does have some pretty good breaks to it! until then we are catching some nice gills! can't wait for the 5th!"
558902,grt1,2006-06-27 13:52:00,259,"I was at the point in Keg today for 2 hours and got 1 bite and 1 16inch walleye. I was marking lots at 35 feet but nothing would take a bait. Had to go to Gullrock, where things are really really slow. the mayfly bodies are laying in big blotches on the lake and the seagulls are forming rafts around them to munch on. the whole lake is producing fish in the 10 to 13 inch range in large numbers but I have talked to many people this week and none have caught anything big. the largest 1 guy told me his group got was a 19 incher. Hopefully things will pick up next week."
558904,sifty,2006-06-27 14:32:00,46,Boy I hope fishing picks up I was worried about the may-fly hatch. I've had experiances on other lakes were it totally shuts the fishing down. Long trip to not catch much. thanks for the updates grt1.
558914,Guest,2006-06-27 17:05:00,0,"Renn, When exactly will you be crossing the border on your way up? We will be on our way back on the 5th and in the Falls area around 7:00 PM on Friday. If you are still in cell phone range, I would be happy to give you a call and let you know how we did. Send me an e-mail if you are interested - [email protected] You are right, those September eyes are fat. We also go the third week in September. However, two years ago when we were there the first of August, we did have several over 25 and one at 28, so the big ones are still catchable. Just don't seem to be as fat. I am not an expert in this area, but it is my understanding that there can be two and maybe on a rare occasion three mayfly hatches. However, they are typically done by the end of July. Maybe grt1 can correct me if I am wrong. I think that is why August can be a good month, where as June/July can be sporadic. Weather also plays more a part of success in the spring early summer. Regarding depths, I would typically suggest the flatter the water, the deeper the fish. If you get a good walleye chop or even some nice waves you will catch them in the 8'- 12' range. But more than likely, 18' - 25' when relatively calm. I personally don't like fishing much deeper than 25' cause I feel the walleyes don't survive very often when coming out of that 30+ depth of water. Pattee"
558740,Renn,2006-06-22 19:50:00,87,"It's pretty good. We catch good number of eaters. We don't see the giant 'eyes like a person would in the spring or fall but as far as numbers it may be the best time of the year. We usually catch a good number between 20 - 25 inches. We asked our camp owners son about what time of the year was the best fishing. He told us if we are looking for numbers you can't beat August. Most of the 'eyes we catch are taken from the main lake humps, rock piles and points. I know some people fish the weeds but we stick to the traditional walleye areas. I would think you should have no problem catching fish. Where are you staying? 42 days and counting!!!"
558746,Guest,2006-06-22 21:43:00,0,"Were staying at Procyks, formerly McEwens on Two Island. Really lookin forward to it."
558752,Guest,2006-06-23 07:36:00,0,"Hey Renn, 36 days and counting for us. You may recall I bumped into you at Cabelas a few weeks back. I thought you were going to be up there the same week as us. Sorry we won't be able to share notes. We'll try not to destroy the population too much. Best of luck to you. H Pattee"
558757,Guest,2006-06-23 08:47:00,0,"hey renn! looks like we'll be in camp the same week as you again this year. cabin 1 i believe it is. the tomah crew! i have to agree august is a good time for numbers especially those 20-25"" ers! we caught more of those last year than we ever have in a single week. i can't wait to try it in september or late may one of these years. 42 days can't go by soon enough!"
558785,Guest,2006-06-23 17:13:00,0,What depth are u guys usually fishin in August?
558787,grt1,2006-06-23 17:26:00,259,"hey, Pattee, thought you were going to email me for some reports on the fishing, I was at the gullrock today and along with 8 other boats could have filled them with eaters in 20 feet of water."
558792,Guest,2006-06-23 18:14:00,0,">What depth are u guys usually fishin in August? We've gone up the last three years that time of year and fish the humps primarily...cloudy, breezy days 13-14 for the eaters, 15-18 in the slot. Sunny days eaters in 15-18, 19-24 for the slot or larger. Have found the best time for quantity of fish, believe it or not, is 10am-1pm and 4pm-7pm...We have the most fun using light tackle with slip bobbers although the Northerns have a hey day when they move in. Craig"
558795,grt1,2006-06-23 18:24:00,259,"I usually fish 20 to 30 feet in August but there are spots that produce in shallower waters. I also like to fish the river in August, you just never know what is floating by."
558801,Guest,2006-06-23 21:16:00,0,"Hey grt1, I have sent you a couple of e-mails but hadn't gotten a reply. Did you change your e-mail address? Send me a note to [email protected]. Looking forward to chatting with you. H Pattee"
558814,sifty,2006-06-24 10:11:00,46,Thanks for the info. I can't wait to get there. Sounds like there a little deeper than they are in sept. Will post report when I get back. sifty.
558677,sifty,2006-06-21 09:29:00,46,Heading up to Five Lakes Lodge on GullRock first week of July with the little Lady. I'v only fished Gull rock in september what different tactics or areas- should I be prepared for when fishing in july? Any specific baits or depths I should be looking for compared to Sept? Also any ideas for other activities other than fishing in the Red Lake area? Little Lady likes fishing but I have to break up the time with some other diversions. Any ideas.
558691,grt1,2006-06-21 14:13:00,259,"I spent 3 hours out on the lake today, could have been home in 15 minutes with my limit. lots of eaters in the 14 to 16 in range in 16 feet of water off the islands. just work the points and the flats by the clay banks and you will catch all you want/need."
558692,sifty,2006-06-21 14:35:00,46,grt-1 thanks for the info. Hoping you were going to reply. Any ideas on things to see or do while were up there besides fishing. Bringing golf clubs have you played the course in Red Lake? Do they offer tours of the Gold mine? Thanks again for the reply.
558693,Mohleye,2006-06-21 14:48:00,368,"Both the resorts I stayed at on Gull Rock had memberships to the golf course, and you could play for free. I never played, but I've heard the course is OK. There are some shops downtown and a couple good restaurants. Google Red Lake Ontario and you will find websites telling you what else is going on. There's a Triathalon July 10."
558705,2746,2006-06-21 20:55:00,3206,"We always play golf when we are there in the summer or fall. Nice course, good way to stretch your legs and get a little excercise (they have carts also) and the club house serves some decent sandwiches. The town itself is relatively quite but does have a couple of decent resturantes. My wife and I usually spend a fair amount of time sitting on the cabin deck reading or playing cards and watching the boats come and go. A much more relaxed kind of trip when she and I go together as opposed to ""the guys"". We also usually plan a stop in the Twin cities on the way up or back for dinner and theater."
558714,grt1,2006-06-22 10:02:00,259,"As mentioned, the golf course is available to tourists who want to forget about the elusive walleye for a day, it is 18 holes, and a long walk, so I would suggest a cart rental. I used to work there in the period after I first retired and it was in good shape. Since that time, the course has hired a new greenskeeper and by all reports the course has improved immensely. It is a great place to relax and curse at those little white balls. Shopping is ok, we don't have any box stores but if you need something you can probably get it in town. (you can tell the wife is the shopper in this house). sometime in July (not sure of the date) is an event called Norsemen Days, it is a weekend to celebrate the contribution of aircraft to the communities of the north. hope this helps"
558715,sifty,2006-06-22 10:33:00,46,"Thanks guys, looking forward to a good trip fishing and a little golf. Does anyone know if you can tour the big gold mine up there?"
558720,grt1,2006-06-22 12:09:00,259,"I just called the mine, they do not give tours, sorry, I guess they want tight security for the yellow stuff they value so greatly."
558724,Renn,2006-06-22 15:38:00,87,"sifty, It's my understanding you have to go in with someone who works there. Two years ago four people from our party went for an underground tour of the mine with our camp owners son. At one point during the tour we were over a mile underground. Talk about a great experience but an erie feeling!! Have a great time and post a report when you return. I will be up there August 5 and again September 2. Renn"
558733,Guest,2006-06-22 17:24:00,0,"Renn, whats the fishing like in early august? Were up there the 5th through the 12th."
