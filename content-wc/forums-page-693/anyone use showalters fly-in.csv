558836,ksboy2,2006-06-26 06:44:00,38,"madison, i talked to a guy who uses them each season. he said the older sr. ed is like that, but his son eddies is great. do you remember who you had?"
558841,Guest,2006-06-26 08:52:00,0,"We have gone with Showalter's for 4 years in a row and have had nothing but good luck and reception from them. While the elder Ed may seem a little gruff at times I would have to say that seeing how some act toward him and his staff I would act like that too. Eddie is much more personable and willing to give pointers on where to fish. Both are excellent pilots. The Wisconsin State Journal ran an article a couple of years ago in which they referred to them as the best ""bush pilots"" available. I would absolutely recommend them with no exceptions!!! FYI we have not fished Apps (Sand Point and South Rapids)."
558866,ksboy2,2006-06-26 21:42:00,38,"curbi, i am leaving for apps on july 6. we'll be at the lake from the 8-14. any advice on best colors/lures? we are going to fish for lakers some, i have never fished them. i will be in the dark on it, other than this site and research online. we plan to take spoons/spinnerbaits/crankbaits for pike jigs and small cranks for walleye spoons/spinners/jigs for lakers most people have said yellow/white/black and chartruese for the walleye sure would appreciate any pointers you could give me. thanks kirk miller mapleton,ks"
558956,Guest,2006-06-29 08:21:00,0,"We have only gone for the walleyes so I will give you what we have tried. In my opinion our best luck has been with 3/8 oz. chartreuse and/or green jigs tipped with either minnows, leeches or crawlers (1/2). Crawlers are nice since they are cheap and easy to keep alive. I have really had good luck using Cabela's ""wobble jigs"". They seem to work best when back-trolling. Once we hit a walleye we would either stop and vertical jig that hole or keep trolling over the area. When they started to hit we really did well. At one point we caught 20 in 20 minutes (all between 20"" and 25""). Hope this helps. Good luck."
558959,Mohleye,2006-06-29 09:24:00,368,"The lakers can be pretty tough to catch in July, especially this year, when it sounds like it's been warmer than normal. Expect them to be deep, and keep your presentations extremely slow. Fish for them when/if you want a break. That time of year, if the walleye fishing is good, I wouldn't spend a ton of time on the lakers."
558967,Gameday,2006-06-29 14:11:00,5,"I just got back from a fly-in with Showalters a few days ago. This year we went to Severn Lake. Two years ago we used them as well and flew into Hammerhead Lake. Both times Eddie Jr. was our pilot and he was fantstic. Great customer service and a great pilot. The other family members back in Nestor Falls are great as well. They all bend over backwards to make everything go well, and they run their business very, very smoothly. Ed Sr. is a bit gruff, though. I'm not sure what his story is, but his gruffness hasn't detracted from our experience at all. Regarding their facilities, I like the way they setup their camps, with separate bunk and cooking houses. Each time we've been provided with 14' Lunds and this last time they were equipt with 9.9 4 strokes. Those babies moved us along much faster than I expected and they were extremely easy to start and they ran very quietly. The fishing has been great each time. Both times I used 3/8th oz jigs with leeches or black, 3"" Gulp minnow grub. Other guys in my group used cranks in addition to the jigs. Regarding jig head color, my experience was that unpainted jigs were just as effective as any color. This time we estimate our 8-person group caught around 1,500 walleyes during the 7 day trip. We also caught somewhere around 50 to 60 Northerns. Most of them were fairly small but we caught a few around 40 inches. We used other outfitters in the past and I would rank Showalters near, or at, the top of the list."
558973,lazyk,2006-06-29 22:31:00,26,I agree that Showalter`s run a first class operation. Eddie Jr. is a very personable pilot and I have flown with him twice. His landings were so soft I had to look out the window to see if the pontoons were on the water. Never really met the old man so can`t say much there but it seems as if Ed Jr. runs the show now anyway. The other workers were very friendly and made you feel at home. I wouldn`t hesitate to use them again and probably will in two years(my budget is on the every other year plan). LazyK
