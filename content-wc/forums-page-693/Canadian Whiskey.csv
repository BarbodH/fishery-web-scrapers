558817,Thunderstick,2006-06-24 14:45:00,35,"In Canada it's spelled ""Whisky"""
558818,GatorGuy,2006-06-24 15:01:00,15,Huh? Not in Winnipeg. Actually we spell it.....RYE!
558821,515,2006-06-24 21:19:00,254,Enjoy Tundra.
558889,Guest,2006-06-27 11:10:00,0,Gibsons is nectar of the gods. Best there is unless it's free and fromyour relatives.
558890,Guest,2006-06-27 11:15:00,0,http://www.epinions.com/fddk-Spirits...ian_Rye_Whisky This is good too!!
558943,phern,2006-06-28 13:34:00,151,"I agree, Crown Royal is great whisky without going overboard on the price. Another excellent whisky was Carlton Towers but it is no longer available. If you want to try something out....how about 2 ounces decent scotch whisky (like Johnny Walker) and 1 ounce of Drambuie. It's called a ""Rusty Nail""."
558945,Guest,2006-06-28 14:08:00,0,been drinking rusty nails for years....Hmmmmm good
558761,Tundra21,2006-06-23 11:22:00,20,"Leaving for our trip saturday July 1st and are having our friends at the resort pick up supplies for us due to the holiday. Last year while in canada we had a really great whisky you can only get in canada and not in the states. it was _____ creek, cant remember the first name , any help will be appreciated!"
558762,515,2006-06-23 11:30:00,254,Forty Creek is the only one I can think of with Creek in the name. Hope this helps. Mike
558763,Guest,2006-06-23 11:42:00,0,There is also Knob Creek but I think that is US.
558772,Guest,2006-06-23 13:22:00,0,"Try ""CROWN ROYAL"" ......And leave that other stuff in the creek."
558773,Guest,2006-06-23 14:15:00,0,Wieser's Canadian whiskey is very good. We pick it up at the Duty Free store going into Ontario.
558774,Guest,2006-06-23 14:32:00,0,I agree with Hmmmm...it would be Weiser to get Royal Crown.
558782,biggeorge50,2006-06-23 16:44:00,128,"Yes, Knob Creek is Kentucky bourbon (like there is any other kind of bourbon). It is a little pricey, but very good, assuming you like bourbon."
558798,Guest,2006-06-23 19:24:00,0,"Canadian fishing is great, but Kentucky Bourbon cant be beat."
558802,GatorGuy,2006-06-23 21:22:00,15,"Are you sure it was ""creek"" and not ""springs""? There is a whiskey called Alberta Springs up here thats pretty tasty stuff."
558811,Tundra21,2006-06-24 08:06:00,20,"Forty Creek was the name, Thanx...pretty tasty stuff!"
