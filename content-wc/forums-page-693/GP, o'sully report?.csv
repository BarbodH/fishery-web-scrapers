558961,Guest,2006-06-29 11:36:00,0,"greg, it was a pleasure meeting you, your wife AND the 2 irish jack russells. i was wondering how the rest of your trip went; weather, fishing, what entrie(s) you made for catch and release:-), etc.? i am also very interested in getting a gps unit of some sort and beginning to accumulate way points for open water structure as i witnessed w/you this year. that is fascinating to me and obviously opens up a whole other dimension to o'sully as to date we have concentrated on the shore and wind blown points. i assume you leave your boat up there till your next trip as ron T. does? the clova got us again on the way out as my nephew blew a spring 10 miles from the paved road. fortunately it was just 1 spring and we limped out ""unscathed"", had new springs put on in Maniwaki, and continued on our way. hope to hear back from you. bruce"

It's great to be able to go to a place like OSLL and be able to find the quality and quanity of fish while fishing morning, midday and evening. The weather in the first week, as you know was perfect for the eyes. Most walleyes caught were between 17"" and 23.5"" Largest walleye was caught by my wife Mari Lou in the first week during the midday fishing period. This fish was caught in the area of one of the many open water structures that I like to fish. I was happy to see my wife bring it in so that I was able to capture the reactions of Mari Lou, Keely and Wally (2-JRT). Well known by all that ML does not touch bait or fish. It was priceless to see her having to hold the fish for a picture- LOL. This fish as well as all of our large fish were released. ML decided not to enter in the C & R contest. I did'nt enter my 31"" and 28.5"" in 2005. We do measure the fish and take pictures but no longer enter fish in the Catch and Release contest. Over the years of catching several large fish we have come to realize that the plaque is not important. We try to get nice pictures and give them to Russell for him to use to promote the Lodge if he chooses. BTW, I really don't know if the C&R contest is still active. We enjoy every fish catching experience no matter what size because it could be our last. The second week brought warmer temp, stable conditions but higher winds. Fishing was productive thoughout the day although my fishing pattern changed during the windiest conditions on the lake. During these times I left the open water and found fish in the many areas on the lake similar to the area where you caught your trophy eye. No trophy fish but many quality fish in short periods of time. The best was during a midday period fishing in 7'-12' water between 11:00 am and 1:30 when we caught 40 walleye 17""-23.5"". We don't keep log books because there are many times I lose track of how many fish are caught. However, as you know I do save g.p.s. waypoints for our areas for big fish and many fish. Send me a PM or email and I'll send you and Andy some pix when I have more time. Glad to hear all in your group had a great time and the Clova road did'nt bite too hard. As we all know the ""road"" is part of the experience and she is the ""BOSS"". She decides to let us in and let us out. Stay well, see you next year. Greg, Mari Lou, Keely, Wally"
