558917,Guest,2006-06-27 18:40:00,0,"We have been there once. It is a beautiful camp with a nice staff that will treat you well. There are a couple of lakes in a system, with the camp being located on the largest, North lake. North lake is a very deep, crystal clear lake. Excellent lake trout fishing. We were complete lake trout amateurs and managed to do pretty well on them with fish up to 10-12 lbs. Walleye fishing on North lake was so so. I think the crystal clear waters made them a bit more picky. Our largest was 27 inches, with around 30 fish per day, but we spent a decent amount of time trout and muskie fishing. Use nothing bigger than 6lb line, and maybe buy one of those ""clear"" lines. We didn't catch any muskies, but a guy from camp caught 5 in one morning all on rocks. The other lakes in the system supposedly had better walleye numbers, but we couldn't take our boat to them because there is a very shallow cut between north lake and the other lakes, camp boats could make it, but we couldnt. (water was low) We usually go to lac seul and I had just as good of a time on longlegged, mainly because of the nice camp and trout fishing. Only drawback to longlegged lake is that it is really expensive. Hope this helps"
