How was your stay and is it an easy navigation out to the Lake from their location? Any help would be appreciated. There have been other topics on this resort, but no one who has stayed there has posted."
558957,stumcfar,2006-06-29 08:32:00,451,Is it possible that know one has stayed at Cherob Resort?
558963,Trailerguy,2006-06-29 12:48:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]No, that's not it, Rob started Cherob resort on the edge of the property he lives on several years ago by building the 1st rental cabin. I'm not sure but there probably are two or more units now. Rob's a straight up guy, did outboard repair for years, Johnson dealer as I recall, saved a fishing trip for me some years ago by getting my engine fixed ASAP. I've not heard any negatives about Cherob from the locals, I just don't think it has the volume to be well known. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
558965,Guest,2006-06-29 13:27:00,0,We just got back from Cherob last week. Our group was one of the first to stay at this resort 3 years ago. This was our third year at this resort. The first year we were there my brothers 70 HP Evinrude had problems on the first day and my brother became very depressed thinking his vacation would be spoiled. Rob who is a outboard mechanic brought down some testing devise jumped in my brothers boat at the dock and found the problem in a couple minutes. It was a carburator problem. Fixed it in ten minutes and my brother was back out in the lake fishing again with no more problems the rest of the week. We booked again for 2007. Rob and Cheryl are very fine people and the 2 cabins (3 cabins next year)are clean and comfortable. The boat landing and dock is less then 100 yards from the cabins. This is a new camp and prices are reasonable. Rob has gas for motors and you can recharge batteries at the dock. Only about 2 city blocks from the highway to the cabins.
