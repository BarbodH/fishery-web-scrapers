558920,Guest,2006-06-27 20:22:00,0,I think I would check on cabin availability in the area and base my week on that. Tnere are quite a few camps that have a waiting list to get in.

Stable weather, fish are on the reefs, often nice and cool in the evenings. I think big fish are available all season. Spring weather really kicked our butts a few times, cold, sleet, howling wind. A few July's were scorchers, could bake in the boat. We did have two great trips around the end of Sept. but again, potential for bad weather. Good Luck, whenever you go, you'll have a good time."

So that could be any type of weather. Hope it's later June. August is tight for me. My kids start school on the 14th and I'm busy at work early in the month."
