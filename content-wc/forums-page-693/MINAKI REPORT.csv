558978,Guest,2006-06-30 15:21:00,0,"We were up to Minaki the week of June 18Th. We fished mostly for Northern and Musky and did quite well. We caught two northerns of about 25"" that still had eggs in them. Does amybody know if this is normal?"
558863,voyaguer,2006-06-26 20:55:00,54,"New commercial operations 2004 in Kenora 40K # per week rough fish (northern pike, muskie etc.) left to rot I wouldn't go so far as to say this is the only reason for declining fishing overall, as I mentioned, there are other reason, but it has declined and this has been a part of the reason. The resort operators will give spectacular reports of multitudes of 28-30"" fish and appear on these sites as independent fishermen. So, go to the Winnipeg River and find out for yourself. There will be days it will be good, particularly compared to daily fishing state side, but it is only a mirage of what it used to be and still could be. Dont listen to me or anyone else, but let your own experience determine your opinion"
558873,Guest,2006-06-27 07:27:00,0,The 40K # per week is less than it use to be.
558885,Guest,2006-06-27 10:30:00,0,">The resort operators will give spectacular reports of >multitudes of 28-30"" fish and appear on these sites as >independent fishermen. I have no doubt about that! Also, when you are out fishing on either of the Sands, watch out for certain resort owners in their fishing boats -- they will crowd you right out of a spot you've marked or are working hard in order to get in on the action. It seems some people really admire resort owners for some reason -- I am suspicious of the one we deal with. His motives are driven by $$$$$$ and self interests."
558896,Guest,2006-06-27 12:14:00,0,"I've seen it all out there when it come's to jerks and fishing. It's not just the lodge boats. Fishing in that area again connot be compaired to the last few years. hydro with there lack of contol of the water levels has most people guessing on where to go and what to do. At least natural resources has started to take steps to save the fishing in the wpg river system, unlike Shoal ( part of the lake of the wood system ) which has had a closed walleye fishing for at least 15 + years. At least to me , Ontario nat resources looks at where the population lives and put's the bulk of the money there. I'm there every year at ice off and I don't miss many weekends or my 2 - 4 weeks I take there in the summer, and in all my years I've only seen one active resource officer that was on the portage to Vermillion. And one cannot blame the native comm fishing. It's been active for a long time. It's still is an amzing fishery."
558897,IaCraig,2006-06-27 12:15:00,434,"I've never been kicked off a spot by a Minaki resort owner, but I've had resort rental boats follow me to several humps before I take off at WOT long enough to lose them. I really don't mind being moved in on when the structure is fairly large, but some of my favorite spots are pretty small and anything more than 1 or 2 boats is a crowd. BTW - I don't admire anyone because they are a resort owner, but there is a Minaki resort owner I see criticized here quite often who is a pretty darn good fisherman. (I don't know him well enough to be a judge of his ethics) My Minaki trip is still a month away, but my wife & kids are coming along again this year so we'll probably spend 80% of our time casting for pike and smallies. IaCraig"
558898,Guest,2006-06-27 12:20:00,0,Craig You are still staying up there in Minaki? If I remember you stay at Brian's (bayview). Has he changed or is he still a jack_zz? As of a great fisherman Mr. #### is one of the best fisherman on the system for walleyes. Alex and Peter are the best for Muskie!
558901,Guest,2006-06-27 13:50:00,0,"You are right about bayview. Stayed there one time and that was the last. There used to be a man that lived in a cabin next to bayview, a short fellow, can't recall his name. He helped us out more the week we were there than the owner himself."
558916,Bears Fan,2006-06-27 18:17:00,30,"I agree on Bayview too. The owner is a jerk and the cabins are in poor shape compared to other camps on the lake for less money. Not to mention the pain it is to put all your gear in a boat to get to a cabin on the other side of the river. I was guilty of not knowing better myself until someone took me to other places. I highly recommended Barbers, but anywhere is better than Bayview. In regards to the fishing, it is no where near what it use to be. It still is a great place, but if you want to catch fish like on lac seul, it is going to happen. A couple of bad spawns with the combination of netting and the upsurge in resort growth have hurt the numbers. Kinda like a ghost town now though with the new regulations, weak U.S. dollar, and tough fishing."
558931,hpdi200,2006-06-28 06:59:00,26,"Bears fan How could you talk like that about such a stand up guy,(Brian) When asked how the fishing was, He said I don't know I have to work all day. No that is how the resort owners are to answer a question. About the fishing I stopped going there 4 years ago because of the fishing and so many people. Duanne built more cabin and just not like Canada to me. It was more like Lake Geneva on opening day! Peter Babers is one of the nicest guys you will ever meet, Trout is also very nice. They run a nice clean and freindly resort. Like said Alex Pete on the Muskies. Duanne on the walleyes. Brian I don't know!"
558948,IaCraig,2006-06-28 15:57:00,434,"Yes, I am still going to Minaki. I stay at Northstar (the petro stop by the RR bridge), Marcy and Mike are locals and very nice to us. Years ago I used to stay at Duanes, nothing against him but I prefer to give my money to Ontario residents. The only encounter I have had with bayview was at a Sports Show several years ago. I chose not to stay there because I wasn't impressed with the guy or their prices. Starting in 2007 I have allocated time to go to both Lac Suel and Minaki. Lac Suel will be a guys trip for walleyes, Minaki is a nice place and I like to take my wife and kids there. We spend most the days casting crank baits for northerns and playing at the beach on Big sand. The boat traffic is way down. I still catch walleyes at Minaki too, but most the time the action is too slow to keep my kids interested and too hard to find slot fish for shore lunch. (nothing wrong with eating 3-4 lb northerns!) The fisherman I was referring to was Duane, I don't know if his son Corey is still around but he also used to be quite a few levels above me too."

558721,woods,2006-06-22 12:29:00,646,"Got a call from my buddy in Minaki last night (June21). He has been there for 10 days now, and says the fishing is the worst he's seen there. Said he talked to a two guys who have been going there for 25 years and never saw it so bad. Even worse than last year he said."
558722,Guest,2006-06-22 15:09:00,0,People are starting to realize why the strict limits and slot were initiated on that system.
558728,Guest,2006-06-22 16:16:00,0,"I have too agree that the system needed to be regulated more, knowing that in northwest ont they don't do walleye stocking as far as I know. But I have to say my fishing sucess has been good to very good."
558749,Guest,2006-06-22 22:51:00,0,Brian...I've had pretty good luck myself the past couple of years but I don't fish like the rest of the walleye hunting heard does up there.
558760,Guest,2006-06-23 11:07:00,0,"We just returned on Thursday, June 22nd from Minaki. We caught a lot of fish but they were small. A fish over the slot was very hard to come by. We arrived during or maybe immediately after a mayfly hatch which I am sure did not help fishing. This has been our second year in a row of small fish. This year we were able to catch more fish in the slot than the previous year. In talking with several people up ther (locals) they indicated that they thought the fishing was ""back"" to normal after last year. The mayfly hatch had slowed fishing but they said it had been very good all Spring. I am confused as to what the status of the fishery truly is. Prior to the last two years we had had several years catching a large amount of fish over 19 inches. At that time I think you were allowed 1 over 18.5"". Where did they go? You would think the one over before and now none over 17.75"" (unless a trophy) would still leave a lot of big fish in the system. I did mark large groups of big fish that wouldn't bite in deeper water. I am not truly in touch with what is exactly the issue with the fishery, just my observatiuon of my 5 days a year there. We love to go and have booked again for next year. Fork-Nutz"
558779,Guest,2006-06-23 15:54:00,0,"Aaron, I have to agree, I see the boats go one way and I go the other. The north shore of big sand can be a awsome place to fish , but from Pistol that's a lot of gas, and on the way there you've passed litterly hundreds of spots over looked."
558793,voyaguer,2006-06-23 18:21:00,54,"First Nation Nets Figure it out there are other reasons, but this is a primary one"
558830,Guest,2006-06-25 19:59:00,0,"I disagree, there has been netting up on that system since i started going there 28 years ago, and not as much now as there use to be and the fishing use to be much better. As you said, there are other issues as well but it's not the netting causing the recent decline in walleye production."
558849,Guest,2006-06-26 13:03:00,0,Was up in Minaki from June 9th and fished until June 17th and have not had as good of a year in the last 30 years as I had this past June. We caught plenty of fish from small to 18 inches and boated approx. 30 fish in one day between 22 and 28.6 inches. Most fish hung around 8 to 10 feet of water. Don R:)
558539,Redtail5998,2006-06-17 14:56:00,34,"Wejust returned from Minaki from our annual fishing trip. Fishing was tough, our group of 7 adults was only able to catch 22 walleyes in the slot limit for 5 days of fishing. We did catch 2 28 inch, 2 26 1/2 inch, 1 25 1/2 inch, 8 22-24 inch, along with a few either a little bit above or below the slot. We fished all the way from Stonehenge to ttrappers cabin most fish came from 15 to 30 ft. It was the fewest fish that we have caught in the past 8 years. Water temp. was 66 to 68 degrees and water level was below normal.:boohoo:"
558542,Guest,2006-06-17 16:26:00,0,"Sorry to hear about your bad luck, I returned on Wednesday and caught more walleye than I ever have up there (most just under the slot but several in the slot). Most were caught in shallow water (less than 10 feet) casting jig spinners."
558550,Guest,2006-06-17 23:04:00,0,"Redtail, I know where trappers cabin is, but haven't heard of Stonehenge. Where's that at? Chuck"
558559,Redtail5998,2006-06-18 16:52:00,34,"Stonehenge is that small island with the rock wall around it, it is before you get to the brush pile. On the boat house on the north side of the island it says Stonehenge."
558564,Guest,2006-06-18 19:52:00,0,"Thanks for the info, I guess we've never heard it called that or saw the sign before. We've fished there often, and there are usually some walleye stacked across the saddle between the island and the point to the south. Chuck"

558588,Guest,2006-06-19 11:58:00,0,"I can't remember the last time I've seen the fish in there summer locations so soon. We did well on Big Sand , but spent most time in Pistol . Lots of slot size fish in that lake. And as said earlier 10' was a good depth.Even as shallow as 6 feet tossing a jig and minnow. In Pistol we troll with a little spinner , and minnow"
558600,Guest,2006-06-19 16:26:00,0,"Where in Pistol were you guys fishing? I only go in there for smallies, around the big island and the rockpile to the east of the island. Chuck"
558621,Guest,2006-06-20 08:15:00,0,Were were you fishing for walleye in Pistol? The only time I go in there is for smallies. Where were they being caught at? Chuck
558631,Guest,2006-06-20 09:48:00,0,they were right in front of the dock!!! Far west shore. Start at the large cabin and fish that shore up to the last cottage going north. On your electronics really watch for small ledges and rock piles. Plus on the East side on the long point there was still fish to be had . Fish on the south side of the point . Plus the weed edge in that big bay holds lots of fish as well. Pistol generally is only a sundown spot.
