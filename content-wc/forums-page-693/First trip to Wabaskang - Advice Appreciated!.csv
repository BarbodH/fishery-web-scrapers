558949,Guest,2006-06-28 16:12:00,0,"Usually by that late in July fish have migrated to deeper water along points and reefs, but I never rule out the weeds. People that can't catch walleyes on Wabaskang in the summer are usually stuck to a game plan that only includes fishing deeper, rocky areas. If those fish aren't active or biting there are always fish biting in the weeds, the weeds have saved my @$! several trips when we couldn't consistently find walleyes on the traditional spots. However, last year the 3rd week of July was incredible for walleyes...and you guessed it, they were out on deeper rock reefs and sand flats, nowhere near the weeds! It should be good again out in deeper water by then this year. Mike"
558771,Guest,2006-06-23 13:20:00,0,"Taking the familiy to Wabaskang the first week in July (Wife and 3 kids). Looking for tips and techniques for finding numbers of walleye and northern. What colors work best? Any spots or parts of the lake I should try first? (The only maps I have seen are the ones i can find online). I'm thinking jig and minnow, lindy rigs, spinner rigs, and slip bobbers are going to be our primary means of fishing. What live bait is going to work best on that lake this time of year? What kind of lures are needed to catch northern? What colors are best for northern? Thanks in advance for any and all info!!!"
558796,Guest,2006-06-23 18:25:00,0,"A lot depends on whether the 'eyes have transitioned out of the weeds and to the flats and humps. I like to troll the weed edges first, you can do this with a good pair of polarized glasses if the weeds aren't out too deep or with a good depth finder. We fish three out of boats...two trolling rigs and the bow person casting artificials into the weed pockets. If the 'eyes have moved out to the flats and humps you need to slow down and get ""vertical"" with the 'eyes. The narrow areas are always good in the evening hours and early morning casting islands for smallies is a blast. In the evenings, look for smallies and northerns chasing minnows in the reeds and work floating minnows through the reeds for some great action...where are you staying? A lot depends on your location on the lake and how far you are willing to travel. Craig"
558800,Guest,2006-06-23 20:11:00,0,"Gosto, If you look down a few pages you'll see a quick report I added to ""What's happening on Wabaskang."" This was from last week and I doubt very much has changed, except the eyes should be moving out to reefs and also alot still in the weeds. The northerns will be very good and willing to chase about anything. I'll be up during that time frame as well if all goes as planned, look for a Team Crestliner and ask me how things are going. Mike"
558831,Guest,2006-06-25 21:51:00,0,I'll be staying at Gawleys Parkview Camp and will have a red Lund Explorer. Where should I try that first Saturday evening? What do you think the best live bait will be?
558833,Guest,2006-06-25 23:35:00,0,Buddy up with Gawley's son. He'll give you a lake map and tell you what bait to use.
558834,Guest,2006-06-26 00:02:00,0,"Since its only the first night that you get there I would buy a couple dozen minnow, drive through the first set of narrow by sleepy dog, turn right, then start trolling along the bays and points just to your right and north as you by the narrows. Those bays are loaded with cabbage and the points always hold walleyes. I wouldn't venture to far out the first night and I'd stay in that part of the lake and do some exploring with a spinner rig w/minnow. I'd save the north end of tbe lake for the rest of the week when you have more time and a better idea of the ins and outs of the lake. Good luck and I'll make sure I say hi when I see ya. Mike"
558838,Guest,2006-06-26 08:23:00,0,"Thanks for the info! I'm counting the hours. Also, what about underwater hazards on the lake? Are there a lot of unmarked reefs or other lower unit busting things I need to be aware of?"
558875,Guest,2006-06-27 08:25:00,0,"I found a .pdf file map of the lakehttp://www.peffleyscamp.com/images/wabaskanglakemap.pdf It has grid coordinates on it. I'm assuming the points and bays refered to above are between P-8 and Q-9? Also, if anyone could give me a few more spots to try to get on fish quickly I would really appreciate it! This will help justify the cost of the trip to the wife :-) Thanks!!!"
558900,Guest,2006-06-27 13:26:00,0,"You can hit the second narrows from Gawleys resort in the evening. This is a very narrow area and Peffleys will be running their launch through there transporting guest, but if you stick to the south side close to the reeds you'll be o'kay. There is a lot of current there and the 'eyes like to hang on the edge of the drop. We used to anchor and jig or use slip bobbers and hang the bait right off the bottom...leaches or minnows work well. Sat there one evening and two of us pulled in 30 in less than 2 hours. It does get heavy pressure in the evening as there are a lot of cabins in the area. We see a lot of moose and bear crossing at these narrows as well. As Big Mike stated earlier, hit the weed edges in the bays north and west of the first narrows...troll point to point staying right on the weed edge and you'll pick up 'eyes, perch and get broke off by 'snakes'. Picked up a 28"" 'eye in that area 3 years ago. You're staying in the most ""people populated"" area of the lake, so if you looking for solitude fishing, you will have to travel. Good Luck and hook up with Big Mike or Trailerguy...they have the best info on Wabby. Craig"
558918,Trailerguy,2006-06-27 19:07:00,1407,"[font color=green size=3][b]Like most sheild lakes, Wabby has some reefs that aren't marked on maps. A few years ago I was up by an island near the resevation, the one with the big staight up cliff face. I was actually hanging out in the shady side, where the breeze was cool on a 100* afternoon just goofing. Anyway I found a rock pillar in 20+ feet of water that isn't more than 3 feet around...with the prop of course. I couldn't beleive it, so I checked it thourghly with the depth finder and then the prop...again. You absolutily couldn't see it on the screen, but it was certinally there. Generally when you are running near wot, space yourself evenlly between the shores, and give the 2,3,4th points a wide bearth going north after the 1st narrows, one comes out a couple hunderd yards, sometimes somebody puts out a jug to mark it sometimes not. Anytime you see a jug marker beware. Wish'in I was fish'in on Wabby"
