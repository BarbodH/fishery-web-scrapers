558932,Guest,2006-06-28 07:21:00,0,"I have fished the monument bay area for years this time of year. What I have found for walleye is they will be transitioning out of the weed lines and bays to rock humps. There has been a clear pattern being the best humps are the ones nearest the bays or out from long weed lines. It seems to be the first stop they make as they head out to the mid lake isolated humps. You will quickly know if the walleye have recently been in the weeds as they will have small leeches on their fins. I typically fish the area between monument bay and portage bay as you head toward the narrows/bishop point. Jigs and 4 inch plastic ring worms, plastic grubs have always worked very well. Fish the wind sides. for smallmouth - work the shad side shorelines with lots of fallen trees laying from the bank into the water. Flip a texas weighted wooly hawg,tube, 4 inch senko worm. Also shorelines with lots of small round rock about the size of a softball or volley ball are good areas to check."
