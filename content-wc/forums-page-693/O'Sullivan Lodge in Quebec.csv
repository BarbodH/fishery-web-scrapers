My buddy got a 28"" 8lb Eye, I got a 26"" Eye and many keepers 17-21"" (Big ones were all revived and released) Pike was great too; 14 lb, 15lb and a 42"" (16lb?) caught/released. Weather was cold and rainy first 4 days, just perfect. Stick baits and jigs were great. How'd you do? Anyone get Lakers? Bust a spring on the road? (We had one down this year, which is good in a group pulling 5 boats) I miss it badly already. Andy"
