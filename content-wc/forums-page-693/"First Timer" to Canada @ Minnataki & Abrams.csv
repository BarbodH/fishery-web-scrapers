558847,betterzebco,2006-06-26 12:21:00,7,"I'm taking a young man to Souix Lookout in one week. We will be fishing Minnataki and Abrams. This will be his first time to Canada, actually his first time out of his county. He has only fished off of docks on farm ponds with his ""Jeff Gordon pole"". He wanted to go last year but I wouldn't take him on a boat untill he passed his swimming lessons. This young man is very, very excited. I could use a walleye up-date about the Minnataki and Abrams lakes. What has been working, how deep, weather forcast, may-fly hatch coming or gone? Thanks for any help for me and my little buddy."
558851,Guest,2006-06-26 13:26:00,0,"Just got back from Sioux Lookout. Walleyes were in 10-15' along weedlines, caught most of them early morning. Biggest was just 23"", but a lot of fish in the slot. Didnt notice many mayflies and the weather was decent. I hope your little buddy has a good time, Canada can be real fast fishing, we caught more last year, but it could be different when you go up. Caught most of our fish on Lindy rigs with nightcrawlers. Frog Rapids bridge was a decent spot as well. Anyone else have any reports from the area?"

558869,scar,2006-06-27 07:10:00,196,better zebco-i was up on minnitaki with a group of 18 june 17 - 22. we had 5 boys ages 11 -14 with us and they had a blast. there are two no brainer spots on the lake where eyes bite all of the time. 1) go to the english river and either drop anchor and jig with crawlers on 1/8 or 1/4 oz jigs. 2) or slowly go up the channel to the left of the rapids and park your boat at the rocks or near them and walk up. take 1/4 oz. jigs and tails. from the rocks throw into the fastest water and reel in slow jigging only once or twice as you reel. you will catch an eye about 5 out of every 10 casts. eyes are small here though 13 -15 inches is average but its very senic here and the kids have a blast 3)rice river sanctuary-use spinners with 1/2 a crawler and back troll. go in through the channel and back troll the first big area after entering. small point on left with old trappers cabin on it. we usually don't go past that. bigger eyes are on the mid lake reefs. click below to see pictures.http://www1.snapfish.com/thumbnailsh...13/t_=40317113 scar
558874,betterzebco,2006-06-27 08:18:00,7,Thank you for the advice. We will be sure to check out the spots.
558877,Guest,2006-06-27 08:30:00,0,"I have been on the lake a couple of times, early June and mid July. Plan on putting lots of miles on your boat. I would stay completely away from the community spots, they will not produce 100+ fish days. Fish all wind swept points, islands with gradual breaks. And keep moving until you hit fish. Almost every spot will produce 2-5 fish, but you need to be active to have outstanding days. In June this year the fish were in the emerging vegetation and shallow. Last July the fish were on mid lake reefs. There are literally hundreds of reefs. The best I found just motoring to other spots while watching my electronics. Big fish are scarce, the 28+, but we caught hundreds in the 20-23"" class. Good Luck!"
558883,Guest,2006-06-27 09:13:00,0,"Great photos scar, looks like you guys had a good time. I second the english river and rice river spots, they are sanctuaries that are closed until the middle of June and can be very productive, but most fish are smaller, will be good for the young buck your bringing along. I think its great that your taking the initiative to bring a kid to Canada and pay for his trip, we need more sportsman like you. Scar, I have never caught or seen a carp in Canada, how and where did you catch that beast, I bet that tasted good in the frying pan, what a pretty fish."
558887,Guest,2006-06-27 10:39:00,0,"The big one's are usually in the water & what you should use to catch them is the end of your line. Find more tips at www.firelinebabe.com, click on ""neighbor"" link."
558910,Guest,2006-06-27 15:55:00,0,"I took my son when he was 11, now he is 27 and for the last ten years has been going with me each year, we also have others in the group. It has been a wonderful experience as we have a lot to talk about through. He now invites his friends to go. So each year we often have a new person in the group. I really look forward to these times together. Hope it goes well for you."
558919,Guest,2006-06-27 19:43:00,0,"An easy way to find good places is to take someone that has experience in Canada, like a neighbor, friend, car dealer, etc. You can make friends in Canada by being yourself, not making up stories so people don't think you're a bad fisherman. Have fun in Canada with your dad, I mean your kid!!!!!"
