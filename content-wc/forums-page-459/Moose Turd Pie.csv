If someone in my group screws up, whether it be, scorching dinner, forgetting a key ingredient or just doing something stupid in camp, we have always for as long as I can remember, used the term Moose Turd Pie. The response is always ""That's my favorite"". I don't know where it came from, just the way it is. It implies that if you don't like what we are having for dinner or what we are doing, the complainer gets to take over that particular duty. Sometimes things don't go the way we want them to or think that they should be but having this fine tradition in our camp does keep bickering down.Anybody else?"

Back when I was guiding at Kesagami one of the guests had collected a bowlful of moose droppings. Said they wanted to bring them home for a souvenier and cover them with lacquer. Anyhow, said guest was sidled up to the bar nursing a drink with his bowl of moose poop next to him. A very large, very loud red faced gent from Ohio barged up, beer in hand and started mowing down on the moose turds. We stared at him aghast trying not to laugh, figuring for sure he'd spit the first one right out. After he gobbled down 3 he noticed a few us almost dying of laughter and asked what's up. Have to hand it to the dude, he never skipped a beat. Said it tasted like granola and ate a couple more before storming out."
