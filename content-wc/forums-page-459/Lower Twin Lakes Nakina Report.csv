A friend and I shot up late September for a short trip to Lower Twin Lakes Lodge. It's a drive to camp right in Nakina. Managed one full day on the main lake and put 60 plus walleyes in the boat once we figured out the pattern. Nothing huge, but some nice chunky fish. Bonus for me was two GREAT days of phenominal brook trout fishing on a nearby lake that John the proprietor took us too. Tons and I mean tons of beautiful trout, it was a total blast. My buddy brought up his 20 gauge and had a couple days of really world class grouse hunting as well. Time was limited and we were forced to leave, but it wasn't easy. John was begging us to stay one more day to fish Wababamiga lake, a huge body of water N/E of his camp. He was going to haul a boat and motor in there for us. No camps or lodges and very little pressure from locals. My guess is it would have been pretty good. Something to look forward to next year for sure. Best part of the whole trip was the price, it was very cheap. Anyone looking for a decent experience but can't afford a fly in this is a definite option for you. If anyone's interested my full report can be seen here complete with pic's and a couple of video clips:http://ontariofishingcommunity.com/f...howtopic=58242 Cheers, Mike"
