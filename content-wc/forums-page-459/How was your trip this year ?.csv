1366169,Jiggy06,2011-11-17 20:56:00,7,"Another year at Cobham River Lodge in Manitoba. This last year we had a few new people to our group and in our 1 week trip they said to me they either said the words ""Thats the biggest fish I've ever caught"" or ""Thats the biggest fish I've ever seen"" during their trip. Just glad nobody had to call me a liar after my winter convincing them to come up. Happy to say our group for 2012 is bigger than last years now that they are the ones convincing their friends to join us."
1366217,GOBIG,2011-11-18 07:31:00,126,"Anytime you go on 2 trips, one spring and one fall, it is always good. Caught just over 1300 fish at Melchett lake in the spring, and I was at Eddies in late Aug, which was the best place I have ever been. Although I did manage to get 9 stitches in hand in camp at Eddies. There was a guy in camp who saved me a lot of money, and did one heck of a job in the wind and out on a island."
1366384,bigwalleye1,2011-11-18 18:30:00,2632,"Had two great trips on Lac Seul this year, one in June, one in July. The July trip was the best yet. This one was the 5th in a row with my 72 year old Dad as my boat partner. I've got the truck, I've got the boat, I cook lunch, buy chow, arrange the place to stay. His biggest decision is what color skivvies to wear. It's great makin' memories with him that are still ""father and son"", but also as a couple of friends who can talk about work (retirement for him) law, politics, baseball, hunting, fishing. I remember all the times he took me fishing as a kid, and I know there are a lot of places he'd have liked to cast to first, but he'd point with the rod and tell me ""put one right there"". We fished a lot of northerns and panfish when I was a kid, and It's great being able to take him walleye fishing and do the same thing. Maneuver the boat over the hot hole to put him on fish, make sure he's in the water first, etc. Best of all this year was I built him a St Croix Avid over the winter, put a nice reel on it for him, and watched him catch his first 2 walleyes on the new stick back to back, a 27.5 and a 25 off the same rock pile and I'm just standing there watching, running the boat, line out of the water...And him yelling that the rod was so light he was afraid he'd break it! Lots of other memories from that trip, and from the summer, but that's a special one. Makes me smile just thinkin' about it."

1356014,turtle chain,2011-10-07 12:43:00,1398,"just looking for big walleye and don't want to pay $1500 or $2500 for small fish the trips have been fun but we have a place in northern Wisconsin . Lake Michigan and Winnebago for $2500 I can go all summer ,18-20 inch walleye we have here at home. a 100 23-28 inchers would be a different story I would pay for that I am not cutting on people that love to fish small walleye.It is time for me to move on that's all.maybe save a few more $$ and head to Alaska"
1356051,Ten Horse Johnson,2011-10-07 14:35:00,235,"You should look into the Columbia River in Oregon if big walleyes are what you're after. That or Green Bay, or possibly Lake Erie."
1356056,Pikeslayer8,2011-10-07 14:49:00,1460,Marlin will be running soon in Cabo. Go Diamondbacks.
1356062,turtle chain,2011-10-07 15:20:00,1398,that is what we are planning. Don't get me wrong I have been going to Canada since I was a kid with my dad.It is time for a change that's all
1356113,SteveJ715,2011-10-07 19:25:00,59,"Went to Discovery Lake Lodge outside of Sioux Lookout for the opening week of the season with my Dad. It's a unique place with several smaller lakes to fish, including one with lake trout. The lakes are close enough together that we fished three different lakes a day more than once. A cold snap moved in after the first day or so. (We got snowed on Wednesday morning.) We picked up walleyes here and there until the weather warmed back up, and then they turned on. I counted just shy of 100 walleyes between Thursday night, Friday morning and Friday evening sessions (for myself  I'm sure my Dad had similar numbers.) We spent a fair amount of time fishing for lake trout, and managed to catch a few. We also caught the most pike in one week that we've ever caught, probably close to 100, between jigging for walleye, casting for pike and trolling for lakers. Most of the pike were in the mid-20s, with one 32.5 and a 40-plus heartbreaker that bent my leader clip at the boat and swam away. The first week at a new place is always a learning experience, and this year was no different. There were some lakes we never even tried this year, so we'll be doing some learning next year, too. But that's the bottom line; we'll be back. The cabins are amazing; the owners go out of their way to be hospitable and make sure you have a good time and catch fish; and the price is hard to beat."
1364312,michigan walleye guy,2011-11-10 20:36:00,95,"I have been to Larus Lake for 11 consecutive years, and wouldn't think of missing our early June trip. When we flew in this year, the northwest winds had us pinned in for a few hours, so a few of us walked down to the dock and made short work of the camp limit for walleyes, although it was hard to sort through the 22-24"" walleyes in order to get eaters. Ten minutes from camp is a beautiful inlet river, where you can catch fish after fish (in June) until you tire of it. I also got to go to Clear Lake with Nestor Falls outfitters this year, and had comparable fishing, even though none of us had ever been on that lake. Dave and Michelle will provide you with a world-class experience. The fact that the Lindner guys use Nestor Falls outfitters speaks for itself.For trophies, I like to fish the border lakes on the Gunflint trail. I was lucky enough to put 32"" and 33"" walleyes in the boat this summer. But it's not a numbers thing on these border lakes.Can't wait to go back this summer!!"
1364552,1shooter,2011-11-11 17:23:00,1493,Cost per fish.....yikes if I figured that it would not be good. Canada or at home.
1364839,Jaskonie,2011-11-13 08:39:00,80,"We had a great trip out of Horwood Lake Lodge near Timmins Ont. We caught hundreds of walleye all mainly 13-18 inches with the largest being 25. Numerous pike with the largest being 36. The accommodations and boats were fantastic, and the meal plan was to die for. We went the last week in June. Horwood is a huge body of water and the camp at the northern end of Hardiman bay is in a narrow section of the lake. You have to make some pretty long runs south to explore the lake and you dont want to be on the water after dark there are a lot of floating logs. Definitely a place we would go back to or recommend."
1365871,geareng,2011-11-17 06:39:00,335,"Been going to Canada for about ten tears, used to go to Lac Seul then switched four years ago to LOTW. We have watched the average size of the fish increase every year on LOTW, with this year being the best and most consistent we have seen. Can't wait for next year!"
1354237,dodgeman29,2011-09-30 19:29:00,11,"Toughest fishing yet in Canada. We just got back from Rainy Lake, north of Fort Frances. Temps were unbelievably hot for this time of year, high 70's, no wind to speak of until Thursday and really nasty green algae that I've never seen in Canadian waters. Water looked like pea soup. We caught walleyes from 2 to 54 feet of water, but no numbers anywhere. Couldn't find any pattern to speak of at all and we threw the kitchen sink at em. 26 1/2"" was biggest walleye of the trip and a couple of 24's but mostly small fish under 15"". The same went for smallies. Couldn't find a pattern and no size to what was caught. A 40"" northern was tops with a 38"" and numerous fish between 30 & 33"". This was my first time on northern Rainy Lake and I can see the potential for big fish and numbers but unfortunately we ran into some really tough fishing conditions."
1354302,eyeman_1,2011-10-01 06:48:00,690,"We had our best trip ever this year the week of the 4th of July on Lake of the Woods out of Wiley Point. It was my 7th trip there and each trip the fishing has been better and better. Went with a good friend and his grandson on his first trip and he's now spoiled. We fished for eyes till noon or so each day and then hunted smallmouth and muskies the rest of the day and still caught eyes. For the week we quit counting at 750 eyes and that was with out counting fish two days. Bouncers and spinners with crawlers in 6-16' were the ticket along with lindy rigs and leeches. We also caught eyes casting jointed shad raps on rocky banks, reefs looking for small mouth. Speaking of small mouth we caugth close to 300 for the week. We prmarily casted crayfish colored cranks to rocks and some soft plastics. The only real problem was running out of shad raps or crayfish colored cranks. The eyes also slammed these baits and so did some real nice pike up to 38"". While musky fishing we caught two, lost one and had so many fish follow we couldnt keep count. The biggest fish was mid 40s but the biggest fish we saw followed in the grandson's rattle trap and we watched as the boy pulled the crankbait out of the water and the fish just sat there off the side of the boat and looked at us. He dropped the bait back in and figure 8ed and the fish came back and followed but wouldnt strike. Steven was speechlees...and had that look on his face for the rest of the day. I can't wait to go back and get my dad back up."
1354333,MidWestFishman,2011-10-01 09:48:00,44,I took my fist trip to Hawk Lake Lodge this year. I had never fished for smallmouth before so was hoping to catch a couple 17 inchers. That was low expectations for that lake I found out. Caught at least 10 that size but also 2 over 18 and a 19.5 beauty. I also caught a 25 and 27 inch walleye. The fishing was excellent even with it slowed down by torrential rain and lightning on 2 days of the week long trip which was over the July 4 week. Each night at dinner the stories were pretty much the same from everyone on most of the days there- excellent fishing and everyone catching trophy size fish. It was the first time I had used top water lures and that was quite the thrill to see the bass go after the tiny torpedo lure I used. Now I have to wait a long wait till next year so I can do it all over again!
1354727,Larry Mac,2011-10-03 07:16:00,530,"Our first trip was June 19 to Madison Lake with Polar Bear Outfitters out of Cochrane Ontario. We wanted to try driving up through Michigan and crossing at the Soo. This was a nice change. We saw lots of bears and moose. We did enjoy it. Our trip to Madison Lake was fun. We did suffer through some equipment issues i.e. camp boat motors and cabin (front door and hand water pump) but we made the best of that. It is a small lake and the fishing was good. We caught lots of walleye and Northern pike with little effort. The weather was good except for the fly out day which was windy and foggy preventing us from leaving camp until 6:00 PM. Mother Nature is always in Charge LOL. Our second trip was to Hornby Lake September 5. This trip was also sucessful with plenty of walleye caught but very slow on the Northern. The facilities and equipment were in good shape. We had 2 very hot, still days which slowed the fishing down somewhat but we still caught fish.The border crossings on both trips were a non event. Overall it was another great year North of the Border and hopefully many more to follow.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1355085,Mike Kansas,2011-10-04 09:42:00,1463,Both of our trips to Canada were awesome like they always are. Have to thank the great folks at Lac Seul Lodge and Lost Island Lodge on Lac Seul for their continued great service and the hospitality they so gladly extend. Mike Kansas
1355091,HeHooksHimself,2011-10-04 09:57:00,725,"Two trips for me this year. 1- Our spring favorite Wine Lake Camp first week in June. Caught some nice lakers, largest in our group 31"". Caught lots of walleye, biggest 26"" Pike action a little slower, biggest at 38"" Smallies were consistent, but not huge, biggest at 16 1/2"" Best of all we had a great cabin and a great time. Our group of four consisted of old timers who have made the trip many times. WLC is a great camp, see previous posts for my assessment of WLC and that fishery. 2- Fall trip Sept 9-12 with Cobblestone Lodge. Just two of us, my BIL and I. Something new for us. Interesting read about that on thread labeled ""Cobblestone"". Plenty of fish but nothing trophy sized. Beat the snot out of my truck, but it was four days of good weather and lots of fun. Learned a new way to fish (you'll understand if you read the thread) Next year planning a return to WLC during opening week. Should be great for lakers but we may be early for walleye. That's okay, I love catching those big lakers. We haven't nailed down our fall trip yet, but are considering Cliff Lake- any feedback on that one? 227 days...."
1355799,jaym,2011-10-06 17:26:00,89,We were looking for a forth person. My 83 year old mom asked if she could go with us. After the initial shock we agreed. She had never been fishing in Canada and hardly fished her whole life. Thirty minutes on the lake her third fish was a 28 inch walleye. She complained the rest of the week that the fish she was catching wasn't as big as that one. We had a great time and her fish was the biggest of the week.
1355846,rather-be-fishin,2011-10-06 21:45:00,429,"This years trips to Lac Seul was FANTASTIC!!! It just keeps getting better & better each year! Within 2 hours our group caught walleye 26"", 27 1/2"", 28 1/4"" and a 32""!!! Catch of a lifetime and soooo fun to be there to watch! Good times with family and friends! Countdown is on for next years trip! 9 months to go! RBF"
1355891,mrwalleye5,2011-10-07 06:53:00,1922,Went to Camp Narrows on Rainy Lake in Mid July. This was a travel by our own boat ( 7 miles) to the camp and stayed in a cabin. I have been on many fly ins and this was as close to what I have been experiencing that I could share with my wife as she has never been on a fly in. Fishing was as good as I could have hoped for and she really enjoyed it so that is all that really counted.
1355932,turtle chain,2011-10-07 08:55:00,1398,"fun trip 175 doz minnows 6 guy's we used them all 100 fish days were common 24 inch walleye 40 inch northern.The walleye were small for this trip and the cost was to high for small fish so for me I will be fishing local waters in Wisconsin in search of big walleye,I have been to Canada 25 times and the best water for the big girls has been lac seul.I will now spend my money in the great US of A . Done with Canada for now the fly in trips have smaller fish and cost more"

1353899,GWC,2011-09-29 13:33:00,1021,"Just got back from 8 days in Canada. Had a wonderful trip. There were two of us. Some days we caught 50 or more walleye. Everything was caught on artificial lures. The big fish for the week were:26 inch walleye33 inch northern37 inch northern43 inch northern44 inch northern caught with a 21 inch walleye on the same lure (both were hooked)46.5 inch northern (caught within minutes of the 44 inch combo).We've been going to the same resort since 2007, this had to be one of the best ever weeks. This was only the second time that I've gone in September. We usually go up in June for spring fishing & that trip is already booked."
1353913,new hips,2011-09-29 14:25:00,498,"Went the end of August, walleye fishing was great, lots of 18-21in fish, Northerns were not in normal areas. Lakers were tapping the lures but not eating, very frustrating."
1353925,Ten Horse Johnson,2011-09-29 15:16:00,235,"Very fun trip on Okanse Lake near Ear Falls in early August. We used Kabeelo Airways. 6 of us, and in four days we boated around 850-900 walleyes. Largest were two just over 26 inches. Probably 80-90% of the fishing time was spent targeting walleyes (with incidental northern caught here and there), but we caught some smaller pike when threw lures for them. Largest pike was 36 inches caught trolling. Great times!"

1353969,wallydave,2011-09-29 17:51:00,2151,"Our group, had a great trip! We had some tough conditions, changing weather fronts nearly every day. Took a newbie for his first trip, that made it special along with getting away from the daily grind, the memories that can only be made with a group fishing the Great North! The cry of the loon, bear and moose sightings and yes the fishing! We were able to still have walleye each day, and bring home our walleye limits! Great trips come when a group works together with the catchimh the cooking and making memories! We have our trip for next year all set, now it is just a matter of waiting until next June when we can make a few more of those memories that make the trip worth while!"
1354223,jkwildhunting,2011-09-30 18:15:00,361,"We took a group of 13 with us to Gull Rock In July. It was def not one of the best trips we had. Personally me I like to go up and fish, fish, fish. We had to show 5 other boats around the lake most of the week. Show them how deep to try, What to use ect ect. Kinda got frustrating after awhile as I like to go explore try new/different lures or presentations at different spots but we could not do much on that trip. We were in middle of a may fly hatch so fishing was rather ""slow"" but we still caught fish every day. Had a lot of mid 20"" fish thru the week. We went back the 2nd week in September. Fishing was better but size was not there. We had plenty of eaters and good action but I was hoping to tie into some bigger eyes. Seemed like we had a cold front spinning on top of us mid week which slowed fishing down but had a good time.The camp just switched ownership at 5 Lakes on Gull Rock so Dad and I were both anxious to meet the new owners and enjoyed the time we have been there wish we could go up to see them more often! We are possibly planning a Earl/Mid March Ice fishing trip up there then will be up in June and again in September. Already counting down the days can't wait to get back up north!"
