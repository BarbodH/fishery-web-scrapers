1364393,dan cardinal,2011-11-11 08:48:00,64,"Larry Mac,Hard to argue with the unit when you can call them like that. Have a great year too!Dan"
1364431,dan cardinal,2011-11-11 11:10:00,64,"Bill, I personally never had the misfortune of loosing a tranducer. However on several trips I struggled to keep the suction cup in place. I recall a trip when a member of our group lost his transducer the first day before he reached the first location. We had no backup. He was a bear to live with the rest of the trip. Your suggestion of the aluminum transducer bracket has got to be a good one. I considered buying one a couple years ago, then I read on this forum about using an SOS pad to clean the area where you desire to place your tranducer. That has worked great for me. This August I fished 6 days, using a 40 HP Yamaha...fairly fast speeds...some days some very rough water... tranducer didn't come loose one time...had to pry it with a screwdriver to get it loose at the end of the week. For those that want to try to trust the suction cup, I am convinced that getting the surface clean is the key...and the SOS pad is the key to that. For those that can't trust the suction cup, Bill has a great suggestion...buy the aluminum tranducer bracket.Dan"
1364516,lacseul810,2011-11-11 15:07:00,22,"Awesome stuff, I really appreciate the feedback. Sounds like an SOS pad is a must! And I believe I will take a backup battery just in case.. I said before that we used to take two batteries and one would charge by solar while the other one was in use so we shall continue to do this. Would be a bummer to have one go out on you and not be able to use it for the rest of the week, although I know Lac Seul very well its always nice to know how deep you are fishing. Thanks again guys!"
1364835,Jaskonie,2011-11-13 08:18:00,80,Any of the Piranha or other portable humminbirds are good. I always turn the fish ID off and use the hooks. Suction cups work great for the humminbirds. Eagle is junk dont waste your money.
1364885,SinOrSwim,2011-11-13 10:40:00,1528,"I have had two Humminbird units both portable. My current is the 595 with GPS. You can make any finder portable with the kit. I have never had an issue with the transducer coming off with the suction cup. But, make sure to tie that thing up because it can happen.Batteries are a different story. The combo color/GPS unit burns through the batteries. We have flown in but use the house batteries to recharge finder and camera batteries as long as it's been sunny. I have also rigged up a flexible solar panel now and it works GREAT!!! It is like those flexible cutting boards so weighs next to nothing and packs very easily. I cut the cord and made a pigtail that has two red and two black coming off the battery. Then, the finder plugs into one connector and the solar panel connects to the other connector. It actually charges the battery as the finder is operating. Works like a charm and that way I can use the GPS and have a color screen. The GPS really drains the battery."
1364971,Larry Mac,2011-11-13 19:00:00,530,"Hi SinOrSwim, I have seriously considered a flex panel solar charger but was concerned about it being powerful enough. I am pleased with your report. Which one do you recommend. Thank you in advance.Sincerely,Larry Mac"
1364974,Larry Mac,2011-11-13 19:06:00,530,"Hi Jaskonie, I also only use the hooks/arches and not the fish ID. We have found them to be extremely accurate.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1365050,Mohleye,2011-11-14 07:42:00,368,"The other tip on the suction cup is to get it wet before sticking it on. They definitely can come off, and if not tied off you can not only lose the transducer, we once had a guy lose his finder too. Pulled it right off the back of the boat. Even if tied off, if it comes loose it can spin behind the boat until one or more of the little wires in the cable breaks, usually right up next to the transducer. So prep the surface, wet the cup and stick it down good, or get the plate that Bill describes."
1365082,SinOrSwim,2011-11-14 09:02:00,1528,"Mine is a PowerFilm that I bought at a local Interstate Battery store. I should clarify, it keeps the unit running the whole day but I still swap out to a different battery each day. One is at the cabin charging while I use one on the boat. But, then I can leave the GPS on the whole day without running out of power. The GPS is a power hog. If I didn't have the solar panel I would get about 4 or 5 hours from the battery. This gives me 9 or 10 pretty easily with charge to spare. I have never tried to use it to just charge a battery but I'm sure it would. I've never taken the time to calculate the amp hours of the battery and what amps the solar panel provides??? Would be fairly simple to do so though.Here is a link to what I have. I don't think I paid that much though? I want to say I paid about $100.00. I wanted weather proof. I also use it in the off-season on my houseboat.http://www.earthtechproducts.com/p2001.html"
1363930,lacseul810,2011-11-09 10:40:00,22,"Gentlemen, Looking to purchase a new portable fish finder this year for my father and the 570 DI Portable has my interest from hummingbird, wondering if anyone has this unit and what is your opinion of it. We will be flying to an outpost camp and they have the typical Lund boats, is it easy to mount to the boat without having to put any holes in? Thanks!"
1364104,Mohleye,2011-11-10 07:55:00,368,"I can't comment on that particular model, other than to say that yes, it easy to mount to the boat. The suction cup holder will work fine if stuck to a clean surface, just make sure to tie the cord to the boat in case the transducer would fall off for some reason. The biggest issue I see with that unit for your use is that it uses a rechargeable battery. At an outpost will you be able to recharge? I bought an Eagle Cuda 300 portable a year ago and like it very much. It runs on AA batteries. A set will not last for a week of fishing however, so you need to remeber to bring spares."
1364141,lacseul810,2011-11-10 09:05:00,22,"Yes that is a good point, we have used a rechargeable unit in the past in which we bring two batteries and have a small solar unit to charge the one we are not using.. only issue is you have to worry about it being sunny outside in order for the battery to get a full charge. Thanks for the reply"
1364179,jambi,2011-11-10 11:15:00,504,"I bought the Humminbird PirahnaMax 230 this year. Worked like a champ, very impressed on both depth detail and marking fish. Suction cup never failed, but I always tied off the cord just in case. Would loose depth at full throttle on the 9.9 but worked fine trolling. This model runs on 8 AA's, ran all week without changing them out. (outpost no electricity) I won't do another flyout without this!"
1364190,lacseul810,2011-11-10 12:17:00,22,"Thats good to hear, we used to have an Eagle model (don't remember which one) but it wasn't very reliable as far as marking fish.. there would be spots where we would literally see fish stacked up on each other but wouldn't have a bite, then we would have times where we would see absolutely nothing and be hammering them. So we basically used it for depth more than anything and after talking with some guides they all laughed at the eagle technology, maybe we just needed to adjust the sensitivity if we could do it with that model but since it was older I think that I will switch away from the Eagle's and go towards Humminbird, I really like the whole down imaging thing too to really see what is down there."
1364220,dan cardinal,2011-11-10 13:55:00,64,"I experienced the same thing with an Eagle Ultra portable....actually worked great all through the years, but getting sensitivity set was critical to actually knowing what was down there. I would see the screen stacked with fish...it was actually weeds. I would also be on points that actually showed no fish, and would be hammering them too. 2 years ago I finally got the sensitivity set to mark piles of fish located in deeper water. But at the sametime it would fill the screen with fish in swallower depths...turned out to be weeds. I bought the Humminbird 385ci combo GPS/finder portable last year for Lac Seul...also bought the chip. It performed beautifully. You may not need the GPS, and although I have never experienced the 570 DI, my thoughts are this would be a perfect unit in many situations. Obviously the DI is going to offer you a realistic view of what is really down there. As suggested by others, your battery charging capability is very critical. I would suggest you could get 3 days out of a rechargeable battery with this unit. If you go color like with the 385ci...my rechargeable lasted a little over a day. Depending on your recharging capability, probably would be a good idea to take an extra rechargeable. Cabela has them for about $20.00.Also keep in mind the suction cup will work fantastic on a clean surface. I take a SOS pad and clean the area real good where I am going to locate the suction cup on the transom. Locate it as deep as you can on the transom...you might have to experiment with this a little to get the right location. But it is nice to be able to read depth and structure while running down the lake...you got to get it in the right location, or you will loose signal while on plane. Tie the suction cup transducer off with the cord provided. The whole idea is to keep the tranducer out of the prop in case it comes loose. So proper length is also important. Nothing will spoil a fishing trip faster that have something like this happen. A back up suction cup tranducer is about $60.00, but could be a good investment...I got one. I also take a back up unit just in case....that would be my trusty Eagle Ultra."
1364234,Mohleye,2011-11-10 14:35:00,368,"I've used portable depthfinders since my old Lowrance ""green box"" flasher....had a Humminbird and an Eagle portable that ran on D batteries. I gave up a long time ago on trusting their fish marking capabilities. As stated, they showed tons of fish when I couldn't catch a cold, and marked nothing when I was catching one after another. The depth is all I'm really concerned about anyway, except when lake trout fishing, and they all seemed capable of marking fish in deeper water."
1364245,dan cardinal,2011-11-10 15:19:00,64,"I used the old Humminbird flashers too in Canada...before I knew portable units existed. Technology has come along way. My new Humminbird 385ci works so good. I'm sure the 570 DI would perform equally as well. My son and I would be back trolling potential spots on Lake Seul, would see nothing on the screen...then the bottom would be loaded with normally bait fish and walleye. I would then indicate to my son that we should get bit just about any time. Most of the time before I could get the words out of my mouth, one or both of us would have a walleye on. Happened like that all week."
1364282,Larry Mac,2011-11-10 18:27:00,530,"Hi Dan, we have the same unit less the GPS. I have been a Humminbird fan many years (Still have 2 100SX portables that work perfectly after many years and many trips). We used the 385c unit (Portable) on two flyins this year. I cannot be happier. Seen the fish, called the fish and caught the fish time and time again LOL. Have a great year.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1364313,Bill Krejca,2011-11-10 20:41:00,6107,"My success with a suction cup transducer holder has been less than stellar, and has accounted for the loss of one transducer. Perhaps some folks have been luckier than I. I'd strongly suggest the aluminum transducer holder from Cabela's, or elsewhere. Its weight is negligible and the depth of the transducer is easy to adjust to pick up the signal at a faster speed. Bill"
