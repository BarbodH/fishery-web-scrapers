As the weather here in central Illinois begins to shift from fall to winter, and the countdown to the 2012 trip slowly begins; a question becons. How many camps and lodges have webcams that we can view to watch the ice in and more importanly the ice out!? I have a couple in my ""favorites"" Red Wing and Tomahawk, both on LOW. Are there any others out there? Thanks in advance!"
1364126,LOW1,2011-11-10 08:34:00,2828,"The City of Kenora has one on top of the Best Western by the Lake of the Woods shore. Great way to view the docks, downtown, etc"
1364138,Golden Eagle,2011-11-10 08:54:00,2642,It was a sad day for me when the generator was shut down at 3:01 p.m. Tuesday at Sportsman's Lodge on Little Vermilion Lake. The web cam will be on vacation until ice out 2012. Withdrawal pain is real.

If you're looking for a live shot of lakes in that area (someone told me this is Pelican Lake, which attaches to Minnitaki), you can't do a whole lot better:http://www.sweetwatercruises.com/I do not work for the company, nor have I ever been on a cruise with them. I can't imagine going all the way up there, getting in a boat and not bringing my fishing pole! Sure, the scenery is great, but...well, I guess I'm preaching to the choir here. Hope the link helps.- Steve"

1364578,Golden Eagle,2011-11-11 20:39:00,2642,Are you still in the fields?
