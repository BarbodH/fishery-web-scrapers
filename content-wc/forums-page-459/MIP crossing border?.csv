1366508,alanexpup,2011-11-19 13:20:00,278,Hi. maybe if you decode MIP folks will respond!
1366526,JayM5209,2011-11-19 15:59:00,1050,Mortgage Insurance Premium? Most Improved Player? Management Incentive Program? Moon Impact Probe? Mobile Internet Protocol? Or. . . . . I'm guessing . . . . . Minor In Possession?
1366528,hogridnfool,2011-11-19 16:06:00,349,I'm guessing that it stands for Minor in Possession; typically a misdemeanor. If there were no felony charges you should be okay. Check here for more info: http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/menu-eng.html
1366529,mrpike57,2011-11-19 16:07:00,97,"If it is a felony in Canada, you will be denied entry Could be a misdemeanor in US and a felony in Canada"
1366580,bpetersen,2011-11-19 23:10:00,251,It stands for minor in possession. It means being caught with alcohol before the legal drinking age.
1366593,chevtow,2011-11-20 05:47:00,691,I was caught and fined for underage drinking 20yrs ago and they let me in every year
