1363797,wishinfishinmn,2011-11-08 19:36:00,52,Looking for some feedback on doing a houseboat for a week and heading up to Chamberlain Narrows. Fishing around there for 5 days. Anyone do this out there? Any/all feedback welcome.WishinFishin
1363846,icenut59,2011-11-09 06:28:00,8,We've done it for 5 yrs. Go through Lac Suel Floating Lodges. In our opinion it is the only way to go. Irene and Andrea are great to work with. Boats are always in good shape. Recommend the biggest boat you can get. We first started out with a 65 footer and upgraded to the 75. We didn't want anybody to have to sleep on the foldout beds in the kitchen dining room area. We stay just south of there so I cant tell you what it is like up at the narrow but I'm sure its good. Many people do go that far. Hope this helps.

We see a lot of them on Lac Seul and have visited with several of the fisherman from them and they all are very pleased. Our group of 25 years at a Lac Seul Outpost is considering giving it a shot based on the good reports we have recieved. I think that a July trip to the Bear Narrows area would put you on some areas that are prolific fish producers that time of year. Good Luck, Mike Kansas"
1363892,JDP,2011-11-09 08:42:00,1457,"Overt the years I have seen and spoken with many of Lac Seul Houseboat groups (http://www.lacseulfloatinglodges.com/).Never have been told of a serious disappointment. Seems to be a first rate organization. Disclaimer: I have not stayed on one of their boats, but would like to someday.I will be at Mahkwa Lodge in July and hope to make the trip up to the bear Narrows area for a day or to. Fishing should be outstanding!"
1364195,tsquared,2011-11-10 12:31:00,57,"We made our first journey this past August using Sioux Lookout Floating Lodges. Having done a few fly in's previously, I am happy to give you 1) our groups perception of the differences and 2) my notes on what we brought/did differently - have a lot of information. I would highly recommend getting the best fishing boats offered and depending on # of people consider upsizing the houseboat. Feel free to PM me and I can get you info."
1364334,rdbalmer,2011-11-11 03:29:00,279,"Our group has done the houseboat thing several times and we really enjoyed it. As posted earlier Irene runs a class act. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend her operation to anyone. A couple things to consider if you haven't are (1) It is about a half day boat ride in the house boat to where you are talking about going. If you haven't been there before I would recommend hiring one of Irenes people to drive the boat up there and help you get set up. The last thing you need to do is end up putting that house boat up on a rock. They also know the best places to tie your boat up for the week. If taking the time to drive the houseboat isn't an issue for you and you know your way up there go for it. Other wise do like we do and take your own boats and go ahead of the houseboat. It is still a good hour boat ride unless you have a fast boat and know your way but you get to fish quite a few more hours. (2) Make sure you know all of the costs involved: gas for the houseboat, gas for your fishing boats, all of the taxes on the boat rental etc. The reason is so you don't get an unpleasant surprise when you go to pay your bill. It has been a few years since we were up there last but at that time you could't get the GST taxes back on the rental because it was considered ""transportation"". I'll never quite believe that one but none the less it ends up being quite a chunk of change. (3) Those house boats are as nice as any of the cabins I have ever stayed in up there and actually nicer than most. You will definately not be roughing it. The area you plan to fish is great walleye/ smallmouth fishing and the beginning of the good musky fishing area. We also caught alot of real nice pike while fishing the rock reefs. Just be real careful of the rocks up there. There are lots of them and almost none of them are marked. We were lucky and never actually hit any but came very close a number of times. The water is very dark colored in that area which makes seeing them that much tougher. I hope some of this makes sense to you and is useful info. You should enjoy that trip alot. Good Luck Rob"

Isn't space a big issue? I just see how much space we use with rain gear, fishing gear, clothes etc. It has to be tight in there doesn't it?"
1364825,Knutson21,2011-11-13 07:36:00,348,We fish 12 Guys on a 60 foot house boat on Lake of the Woods. We love the trip and there is plenty of room. The house boat has 6 bedrooms with bunk beds in each bedroom. The only down side is that after 6 days the toliet can get a little rank.
1367432,cuamb,2011-11-23 13:04:00,203,I have been using Sioux Lookout Floating Lodges since 98 and always go to the narrows. We use their 68 ft boat and it has plenty of room for 8. I agree with everyone to get the largest HB you can. If you are doing a family trip they have a 50 foot with AC and big scree sattelite TV.Depending on when you go the ride out can be between 6 and 8 hours. I do recommend hiring a pilot for the HB. It is a little tricky the first few times.
