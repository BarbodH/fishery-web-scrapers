The same Jeld-Winn windows that I buy here at Menard's cost 40% less than what they do at an Ontario dealer-and they are made near Winnipeg."
1365707,Mike Kansas,2011-11-16 08:56:00,1463,"We always take the allowed amount of USA beer over the border we can. We also purchase a fair amount of Canadian beer and booze once in Canada. We also bring 90% of our food with us from USA mostly because we cant buy the brands we like in Canada and the conveince of having the shopping done prior to arriving into Canada. Bottom line for me is that on our two trips to Canada a year we leave about $15,000 USA in Ontario. Beer cost is a small part of the total expense bring it or buy it in Canada. I would also hope that all tourists be they campers, resorters or people enjoying the beauty of canada should all be welcome especially during a time when the tourist $ are such an important part of the Canadian economy. The fishing license revenue and the taxes paid by non reisdents is a large number which I'm sure is well valued and helps maintain the viability of the Canadian tourist industry."

1365736,wallydave,2011-11-16 10:40:00,2151,"The revival of a nearly ten year old thread might just mean we are looking for anything to keep us entertained until the 2012 soft water season, for some of us anyway, begins!"
1364445,camp chef,2011-11-11 11:54:00,915,We search out specifically lakes or resorts that practice catch and release with limited catch and eat while at the camp.
1364473,Aaron-IN,2011-11-11 13:19:00,500,"Do people really keep Northern? Seriously? I've been going to Canada for 33 years and have never kept a Northern, nor has anyone else I've fished with from the states up there."
1364479,Aaron-IN,2011-11-11 13:34:00,500,"Oh...and as far as the beer goes, sure, Canada has better beer if we are strictly talking the commercial beers (Bud, Moslen, Miller etc etc etc), as far as real good quality beers, US is king with over 1,400 micro brews across the country. Canada doesn't touch the US in craft brews and that's a fact."
1364482,camp chef,2011-11-11 13:35:00,915,we like to keep one about 26 inches or so for shorelunch once a trip. Super good eating.
1364503,Aaron-IN,2011-11-11 14:32:00,500,"That's interesting, I've just never considered keeping one to eat."
1364515,wallydave,2011-11-11 15:00:00,2151,"I have had pike for a shore lunch...fresh it is almost as good as walleye, the smaller the better. Pike are to slimy for me to take home, so we stick with walleye to bring home. Mostly pike are fun to catch and release, especially while jigging with a light or ultralight rig"
1364519,lassh,2011-11-11 15:12:00,553,"As far as beer goes- IMO Canadian beer is clearly superior to US beers. If you are a light beer drinker, maybe Miller Light is better than LaBatt Light. But I think people drink light beer so they don't get fatter not because they like the taste better. So when you are on vacation, its only temporary so why not drink real beer? And if you are drinking real beer, why not drink the superior Canadian beer? and why not patronize the Canadian Companies while in Canada. Try this as a frame of reference if the cost of Canadian beer bothers you- just think about the cost of a beer in a bar in the US and compare it to the comparitive bargain of the Canadian product consumed in the beauty of Canada. And for me, the taste of Alexander Keith's IPA beats any micro brew variety I've had in the US! Have you ever had some guys bring US beer over, you go to your camp and bring along the Kokanee or the Blue and see what beer has yet to be drunk towards the end of the week? Now as far as slot limits go- I have fished Canada since the late 70s and there is absolutley no doubt about the positive impact it has had on the fishery even on remote fly-in lakes. The US could learn some lessons here. I don't agree with some of the anal approaches to rule enforcement (beyond the intent) that appear to be common. 2 sober fishermen have 2 or even 4 beers in a cooler in a boat for a shore lunch later in the day on a remote lake. Some judgement should be used in enforcement but to justify the cost of flying around to check the remote lakes it appears that citations are expected. A fisherman clearly has a legally issued fishing license, but does not have his sportsman card on his person which he clearly has or else he couldn't have the legally issued license and is issued a ticket. A cabin is in Manitoba on a lake which mostly in Ontario except for about 300 yard of the western bay in which the cabin is located. 2 fishermen come directly from fishing Ontario back to the camp in the Manitoba bay. They have kept no fish. They have licenses for both Manitoba and Ontario. They come back because they see the fancy turbo float plane sitting at the dock. The officers see them go directly from Ontario to Manitoba with no lines in the water. They are ticketed because 2 of the lines had hooks with barbs on them. Enough of the whining- I love fishing in Canada more than doing anything else on earth."
1364838,Jaskonie,2011-11-13 08:27:00,80,"It wouldnt be so bad if it were just the beer being higher priced because it is ""superior"" to American beer. However is the $5 a bag ice, or $6 a gallon gas, or $3 a dozen eggs superior to American products. The Mcdonalds or Tim Hortons isnt that much better to warrant double the price of the same stuff in the states is it? It wasn't so bad when the exchange rate was in the area of .65-.75 you could live with it. But $35 bucks for a case of Labatts or even Bud is a terrible waste of money. We like to bring a few cases and bottles in from duty free and go to a meal plan resort, cook some of our fish at night. We will buy a few cases if we need them off the outfitter. Not sure about 2012 if we are crossing the border or not time will tell."
1364844,Guest,2011-11-13 08:47:00,0,"Canadian Guy QOUTE____""They bring their own because its cheaper man. OMNR stepped in a number of years ago finally and is eliminating "" Pork and Bean"" US fisherman who add nothing to the resource. The crown land camping fees and lower limits are just an example.The walleye here in the NW were decimated by the fisherman south of the border because of our managements shortsighted regulations. The fish are coming back nicely now and you don't see the dozens of US campers on crown land that you used to at every new lake opening up. There are many of us here that would see all foreign fisherman have to go through resorts."" Funny how I see Canunks filling up with gas south of the border before crossing back to Canada. Isn't Canadian gas better for your Canadian cars and your health system, Canadian Guy? Shouldn't Canadians have to go thru a tour guide to go shopping, buy gas or even drive on our roads? Eh? Just say'n...Think aboat it that way dude."
1364891,v-bay gord,2011-11-13 11:21:00,3168,"Just to point out the other side of the debate....Canadian Guy...while I tend to agree with the elimination of unregulated camping by non residents, there is a big push on right now by local lobby groups to have the MNR open up all forest access road restrictions to the public.......even if it means accessing now remote lakes that support fly in or other tourism businesses. For what reason? So that the resident angler can park his rv on a remote lake and fish the crap out of it. So while some residents are crying foul over the preservation of ""remoteness"" for the tourism industry, perhaps they need to access it through a resort as well. ....Smalley.....perhaps that gas those Canucks are picking up before crossing the border was derived from Canadian oil? Besides, a Canuck down in the U.S. is probably a benefit to your economy these days.....just saying. It wasn't always the case visa versa, back in the day."
1364210,Guest,2011-11-10 13:28:00,0,"Hi everyone, I'm doing a project about beer in Canada. Specifically British Columbia and Alberta. Where do people buy beer in those provinces?? Supermarkets? Grocery Stores? Beer Stores? Liquor Stores? Also what are the most popular beer brands? And where do people typically drink beer? Pubs? Bars? Restaurants? Sporting events? etc. I appreciate your responses! Thanks!"
1364239,wallydave,2011-11-10 15:03:00,2151,"Not sure about Alberta or BC, but in Ontario, the Beer stores and bars are the only place I have bought beer. Good luck with you research, try a google search for the rules!"
1364324,ManitouBass,2011-11-10 22:01:00,201,"wow, alot of animosity in this thread! I was born in minnesota, raised in ontario. I've essentially been an angler my whole life. I see alot, and I'll say this. Beer is better in Canada, hands down(as per the topic of the thread). But American beer isn't bad, IMO. In fact, some of my most memorable brews have come states side. All the comments about Americans overfishing Canada etc. Lets get real. Americans fish here, illegally, as much as Canadians do. No Bull****! Ignorance is the main factor, but many from both countries do so on purpose, as o many Canadians in US waters. Respectful anglers, will never do this. That is what we need to encourage, not this schoolyard mamsy pammsie crap. Just my two cents"
1364338,NMG,2011-11-11 06:00:00,1053,"In BC all liquor sales are regulated. You can either buy it from Provincial Liquor Stores or through ""Cold Beer and Wine Stores"", which are private businesses licensed to sell liquor as a result of a special license that they receive from the Province. The municipalities also have some indirect control because they approve zoning to permit the businesses to operate. All operators also have to purchase their liquor for resale through the Province. Basically the Province controls the flow of liquor into the Province and the manner in which it is distributed to the end customer."
1364358,Shortline,2011-11-11 07:25:00,234,"I used to be an avid border-crossing angler. Being raised in Northern MN, it was an easy day-trip to cross the border in I-Falls and get some really good fishing. The overall feeling I ended up with after a couple decades of frequent visits was that the local people liked the tourist fisherman coming from MN to fish and spend $$, but the gov't didn't really want us there at all. From the super tight harvest regulations(remember the ""1-fish only, and it must be a trophy"" fiasco regulation??) to the ""no-beer-in-the-boat"" laws, to the live bait pain-in-the-arse regulations, .... I finally decided it was not worth my time to deal with it. I started making my trips and spending my money where I felt welcome.....Manitoba. As far as I am concerned - Ontario can dry up and burn away....I will spend my tourism $$ in Friendly Manitoba(where I can at least keep a meal of walleyes for my family). SL"
1364387,camp chef,2011-11-11 08:30:00,915,"Everyone has there own reason for buying the beer they do be it convenience,price, taste etc. Personally I prefer Canadian beer. I also feel an obligation to help the Canadian retailers. I love being allowed to use their Natural Resources and consider it a privelege. The people we buy our beer and bait and groceries from have become our friends through the years. Most of them have a hard time making ends meet and we sure want them to be around to take care our needs for many years to come. We treat Canada resources just like we teat our own. Good stewardship knows no borders"
1364390,NMG,2011-11-11 08:36:00,1053,"Well said! I'm of the same view when I travel for fishing or otherwise. Respect the area you are travelling in (including their laws, customs and culture), support their local economy whenever possible and most of all, BE OPEN to learn something and expand your own horizons. If everyone and everywhere was the same in this world, quite frankly it would suck"
1364406,v-bay gord,2011-11-11 09:31:00,3168,"Some of the regulations are in effect to control the ""day trip tourist"" who runs across the border for a day of some quality fishing, but has no benefit to the local economy....hence the restrictive harvest regs. If I am misinterpreting your comment, my apology.....but I do not apologize for regulations designed to maintain and improve our fishing and economy."
1364422,Shortline,2011-11-11 10:32:00,234,"No offense taken, no apology needed. Like I said - the restrictive nature of many things may be targetted towards the day-trippers, but they give me the feeling I am an unwanted visitor (and I probably am). I understand them, but when those restrictions are extended well into the province, well beyond reasonable day-trip range for most, that is where I start to feel a little over-regulated. If that is the way it is, I am fine with that, and I will choose to spend my money where I feel it is appreciated. I used to make about a dozen trips to Ontario a year that involved overnight stays....now I make zero and have no plans on upping that number. Manitoba gets my coin."
1364434,NMG,2011-11-11 11:14:00,1053,"I think much of this debate also comes down to the ""Catch and Keep"" vs ""Catch and Release"" philosophy. I have no problem whatsoever with even VERY restrictive regulations if they help to produce a quality fishery. For every angler who won't venture to a location because they can't keep allot fish, there is likely another angler who would choose to go there because the quality of the angling is better. There are lodges and resorts spread all over the country that practise 100% catch and release and many of them have been highly successful in adopting that strategy. That said, coming from BC and a fly fishing background probably does impact my view on this subject. Personally, I would advocate siding on the side of conservation when it comes to regulations."
523867,Guest,2002-08-30 05:37:00,0,"I'm from the US and agree that I would rather drink a Molson than a Bud anyday. However, this is a taste/psychological thing and certainly isn't for the alcohol. Standard US Beer (Bud, Miller etc..) are almost all typically 4.9 to 5.0% alcohol, essentially the same as all standard Canadian beers. Sure you can get the Brador (6.2%) and a few other stronger beers readily in Canada, but they are the exception rather than the rule.As far as the guy complaining about the ""pork and beans"" fisherman, we've fished a dozen times both ways (fly-ins and camping on our own). We treat the fish the same on both. In fact, we keep fewer fish for eating on the drive-in trips because its more of a hassle cleaning them and cooking them when you don't have that cabin sitting there. And the $$$ are spent either way. If we don't fly-in we spend at least two nights in hotels, probably half a dozen meals at restaurants and plenty for gas, bait and beer."
523868,Rick,2002-08-30 05:57:00,226,"The guy that complains about fishermen from the US, ""Canadian Guy"", takes off on rants about the US whenever he can. According to him, the US is responsible for everything bad from acid rain to zebra mussels. His anit-American bias is in most of his remarks so don't take him too seriously. In a previous post back a few months ago, he said that he and his buddies sit and watch ""Cops"" and laugh at our way of life. This is where he gets his info on the US so you have to consider the ""garbage in - garbage out"" theory. One of these days he'll probably hijack a Beaver, fill it with out-dated Canadian beer and crash it into one of our Bass Pro Shops. Or God forbid, a Cabelas.Luckily most Canadians have a more realistic view on the cross border issue and realize that Americans are like Canadians. The governments and social systems are a little different, but the fishermen are similar. There are good and bad on both sides of the border."
523869,catchNrelease,2002-08-30 09:55:00,157,"Great post Rick.I can understand Canadian Guys feelings though.. The Canadians think of Americans as the Wisconsin folk think of people from Illinois:) I was in Canada a few weeks back on a charter bus, we got pulled over by thier cops and you should have heard the comments on the bus. How dare they pull over us American tourists, don't they understand who we are? It was a classic example of the ugly American and his arrogance. .02"
523870,Rick,2002-08-30 10:42:00,226,"I agree. There are still a lot of Americans with attitudes and they should be called on it whenever it surfaces. This Canadian Guy seems to have a contempt for Americans that goes well beyond any cross-border pride or rivalry. Maybe an American doctor dropped him on his head at birth. A certain amount of national chauvinism is expected and can be fun but this guy needs to chill out. By the way, did you hear about the Kentuckian...Have a good Labor Day weekend everybody."
523872,Guest,2002-08-30 10:59:00,0,"Every time I go to Canada I buy Canadain brewed beer. Keiths Pale Ale, Sleemans Silver Creek Lager, Blue, and a few others thrown in for the last days. Don't have a problem staying in lodges but I would like to camp but that cost is too much for a crown camping permit. I think that the Canadians appreciate the money that the fishers bring in just like any tourist place in US (Wisconsin, Northern MI, and even Florida) but don't want the people causing problems. As the bumper sticker I saw in Northern MI says ""If it's tourist season how come we can't hunt them."""
523873,srj,2002-08-30 12:04:00,971,Geez--a lot of testy posting!! Gotta agree with Dwayne--Canadian beer is king. Sip a couple of Labatts Maximum Ice and the fish you caught earlier just keep getting bigger! The best tasting alcoholic beverage I have ever tried was Dow Cream Porter--#2 was Labatts Cream Porter. Both have been unavailable in Ontario for a while. Would any of you Canadians know if they are still sold in other provinces? And thanks a bunch for letting us not only drink your beer but also catch your fish. We need to remember sometimes that it is a privelige to cross the border and pursue our passions.
523871,Guest,2002-08-30 20:06:00,0,"We're too gentle to crash a beaver with beer into a Cabelas...that would be cruel and unusual punishment to the beaver. Rick you are giving me too much credit though for the mussells and the acid rain. Everyone knows Saddam is responsible for the rain and the mussells. Thats good enough reason to invade, besides the price of gas may go down."
523874,Guest,2002-09-02 11:12:00,0,"You ask why Yanks bring there own beer with them........because they are all too bloody cheap to spend a few extra bucks on one of Canada's many fine quality brews. They're happy drinking their own ""made in the USA"" swill rather than buying some real beer instead. They have no problem, however, mooching off their Canadian friends for the premium beer...""could I please try one of those , they look good"". CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP!!Why else do they come up north, and don't let'em tell ya it's for the great fishing cause it's not....it's because of our cheap Canuck dollar. If all of a sudden the Canadian buck was valued more than the old Greenback, all them Yanks would stay home. I'm not USA bashing either, it's just my view of the plain old truth."

I have no idea what the exhchange rate is, only that I could swing the $1200. I asked about the beer and he said we buy it at the lodge, I'm sure it will be Canadian beer. Some of us do come to experience your beatiful natural resources and to fish, not to save money. I live on a 149,000 acre lake in the Ozarks, if I was cheap I would just walk out the back door to fish."

You have gamehogs, and a**holes on both sides. My grandfather was born in the states and I have more than a few relatives who have both passports. The politics are different as is the beer. My father has a fairly remote cabin that some americans use every year for their annual fishing trip, and I personally enjoy drinking their left over bud, even if it is only 1 or 2. It is enjoyable to drink something different and it is not the swill they brew up here and call bud. By the way these yanks who use his cabin have been coming up for a lot longer than the canadian dollar has been weak. As mentioned people are people no matter where they are from and they all have their foibles and IDIOTSYNCROCIES. For those up on their soap boxes, all I can say is take a Valium, just buy it in Canada. Now shut up and fish."

With us, the deciding factor is whether your over-regulated beer stores will happen to be open when we pass one of them. If the beer stores were open longer, we'd always buy it up there, but when you cross the border at 9 or 10 pm and fly out at 7 or 8 am the next morning, where are you supposed to buy some? Keep the stores open longer and we'll never bring in another can because it can be a hassle taking over 1 case each.And by the way, our beer isn't nearly as ""watered-down"" as your dollar.:)"
523863,Guest,2002-08-29 06:48:00,0,"boys, boys, play nice. beer is an acquired taste, kinda like scotch. about 30 years ago on a business trip to toronto, i decided that i did not like any of the canadian beers. about 10 years ago i ran out of smokes late in the fishing week and decided that i ****ed sure do not like your smokes. my brand of beer costs me 35 cents us per can. most of the guys i fish with that bought beer in canada had to pay over a buck a can. those that ran out of smokes had to pay $6-7 per pack. you can buy smokes down her from indian reservations for about $1.50 per pack. our gas is about $1.30 per gallon, yours is about $3.50. it doesn't take a brain surgeon to figure out why we try to buy these items in the good old usa. sorta the same reason that our seniors get their prescriptions filled in canada. money is too hard to come by and even harder to accumulate. why throw it away. that's why i pay for almost everything i buy up there with a credit card. i don't get ripped off on every single transaction by your merchants."

We catch lots now over 36 where before it was relatively uncommon.
