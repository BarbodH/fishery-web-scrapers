1365018,Skywagon,2011-11-14 04:35:00,1106,"Pikeslayer,I think the case in Cabela's link is probably smaller than what you have, as noted in the name, these are for ice fishing and tend to be fairly small. We use them to carry on the snowmobile or 4-wheeer for ice fishing, to carry the short poles and very few assorted other things, they won't hold much, just a means of confining things. You would probably be surprised on how little tackle many carry, or need."
1365062,Pikeslayer8,2011-11-14 08:04:00,1460,Thanks for pointing this out. You are right in that the case in Cabela's link is for ice fishing. Didn't want to bring competition to TFL anyway. I would guess TFL is patented anyway.
1365070,Flip Silverlake,2011-11-14 08:28:00,645,Pocket full of jigs. Just have to be carefull how you sit down.

1365219,Flip Silverlake,2011-11-14 15:42:00,645,The other pocket!
1365240,Pikeslayer8,2011-11-14 16:40:00,1460,"I believe that they have 2 different models using different materials. The one pictured was the more expensive and was 125$. I think the other model constructed with different material was around 75$. It comes in powder blue.I took it this fall on a drive-in to Caribou this fall so I loaded it full of tackle.(no weight restrictions) In June, when I go on a fly-in, I will pare down to 2 trays and probably use the other compartments for rain gear and cold bev. PS- I tried the pocket jig thing, but all I could catch were pocketfish."
1365265,fishincrazy,2011-11-14 17:59:00,1282,"Hello everyone my name is Crazy and I'm a Plug-a-holic!!!!!Imagine not being a single species angler,**** not even a single type of water angler.I've got enough freshwater stuff species specific to sink the 16 foot Lund we get in camp.That's nothin You should see my surfcasting gear.Multiple 9,10,11,12 foot rods even a monster 15 footer for throwin up to 10 oz's and bait.This is just the tip of the iceberg,I've got almost 1,000 large,up to 12-15"" striper plugs I store in tennis ball cans set in milk crates.that's 10 milk crates worth of 20-40 dollar plugs.Then there's the rubber stuff.like 15 lbs of it,metals/tins OMG I need help!!!I have yet to find any storage method which helps me.I'm sick and need help or maybe I just need to go fishing FC"
1366398,Keckers,2011-11-18 19:58:00,26,I hate to feed an addict but I love http://www.overstockbait.com They will have some major sales from time to time and I have purchased large quantities only to keep the ones i want and sell ones I dont want to break even. The problem is that I now have lots I need to sell and my wife said I need to stop. I have lots of extra Storm thundersticks and Rapala Max raps if anyone is interested. Just a warning. If your addicted to lures...Don't go to overstockbaits. It will cost you money.
1366401,downriverbob,2011-11-18 20:23:00,880,"The worst thing I ever did was take up musky fishing, the lures are all pretty much on the big side and relative to other lures alot more expensive. I have three huge boxes that weigh 40 lbs or more and probably only use 10 % or less of them. It's like an sickness. BOB"
1330810,Pikeslayer8,2011-07-17 16:31:00,1460,"Used to have a 3 tray Plano box when I was a kid. Now I've got this monstrosity of a soft side, holds 8 big trays. I can't even take it cause of the weight. Have to scalp the lures I want to take and put into a little Flambeau. Often I fly to Minn. and meet rest of party, so gotts go light.I think I want to go back to the old Plano 6 tray. Plano 8616, 17$.Does anybody have any better suggestions?"
1330821,jaggersr,2011-07-17 17:22:00,44,"Years ago i found myself in the same boat(no pun intended). I had 4 or 5 monsterous tackle bags and plano boxes full of various tackle everywhere. I'm embarassed to say it but I had so much tackle i didn't know what I had anymore. To the point I bought tackle at times thinking I needed it only to find later I already had it. Now don't get me wrong I use my stuff.My wife and I are on the water pretty much every weekend from ice out to deer season and some in between. With 3 weeks of vacations spent in Canada. You get the point, I just didn't want to come off as some hoarder or something. What I did was shelve a section of my garage that would hold approximately 30 to 40 #3600 plano boxes. I then sorted by tackle and used a label maker to mark the boxes. I then put a hatch in my boat that holds two 3600 boxes. I stock this box each time I fish depending on what we are targeting. I now just have two tackle bags. A water proof cabelas tackle bag that holds 3 planos plus some other various gear. I also have a cabelas backpack tackle bag that holds tackle gear and has a small cooler in the bottom that can be easily removed. I use this in Canada all the time, Is great for portages and in the event you flie in to a lake. Or just a long day on the water.Room for thermacell, flashlight, even a few cloths if needed.. At any rate, not so much a suggestion but I feel your pain"
1330876,drew59,2011-07-17 20:30:00,87,"I used to think I had to get as much tackle up there as I could, and then it drove me crazy thinking I didn't have the right thing. Then I decided to make the challenge to take as little as I could. For years now we use silver and gold jigs with a variety of bodies for walleyes and lake trout. We cast. jig and troll them. Nothing but Silver Minnows for pike (love the single hook). I'll confess to having a few crank baits in the box for trolling. I've found that simple is better (and easier)."
1330907,mbay1455,2011-07-17 21:51:00,25,"Wait a minute...what are you guys saying? You mean you don't have to have 10 different types of crankbaits, each in multiple colors, dozens of spoons, enough jigs to stock 20 people and you can still catch fish? I'm calling BS on that....lol My first trip to Canada was over 30 years ago, already an adult. We camped and fished a 'pike' lake (no walleye)and the extent of my tackle was a red/white dardevle and a 5-o-diamonds dardevle and two steel leaders. Caught lots of fish.Have to admit I've gone off the deep end too. I'm understanding the addict more and more. My addiction is apparently shining, bright colored objects with hooks."
1330914,walleye1952,2011-07-17 23:21:00,13,"Oh my gosh......glad to hear I am not the only one with this problem....you guys made my day.....Yes, I have the warehouse tackle boxes in my garage to hold my extras...wouldn't want to be with out............"
1330995,tly,2011-07-18 08:33:00,1900,"For traveling and overall portable storage the Fishing Locker www.fishinglocker.com may be an option. It is light, adaptable and made for travel. The one downside is it needs 2 piece rods since it is only 4'. I have had one for many years and it stays in my truck so I am ready at any time. Plenty of storage for4 rods/reels, reel bags, tackle boxes, tools or whatever. Lots of proected and various size sections. It goes in the boat or on flyins nicely.I have not checked it as luggage but would see no problem. In the boat do not need to clutter up the place with loose stuff (but you can if you want to), just grab new and restore old. Have had it alot of years and still looks good, padding/protective stuff still in place."
1331053,Pikeslayer8,2011-07-18 10:04:00,1460,"The Fishing Locker is so me. Precisely what I want. I think traveling anglers will fully appreciate this. I particularly like the concept of stepping off the float plane and throwing TFL right in the boat ready to go. As camp chef this gives me a better opportunity to set up camp and organize food stuffs.Now about the two piece rods, I'll have to get a few as I have none."
1364910,Pikeslayer8,2011-11-13 14:51:00,1460,"I love my Fishing Locker! Only bad thing now is that Cabelas came out with a new cheap knockoff model. http://www.cabelas.com/catalog/searc...m1=dgb-12-1545Great for traveling fishermen. Suppose it is that time of year again, tackle fondling time."
1364988,Glenman12,2011-11-13 20:17:00,762,"I would learn..every year Im buying the ""next best"" thing in lures and end using and being successful with something I bought 5-10 yrs ago..but I think that parts of being a fisherman"
1365003,Pikeslayer8,2011-11-13 21:01:00,1460,"Yup, we are always searching out the newest shiny bauble. I did take my Fishing Locker on my late fall trip this year and was pleased with it. Thing I liked most was having a few 2 piece rods all rigged up and ready to go.My wife ordered mine for me. She says the gentleman that owns and designed TFL is a Canadian lodge owner who winters in Michigan. I am sorry Cabelas has a knockoff version, but I did spend considerably more."
