1325199,Jaskonie,2011-07-02 09:48:00,80,On the top of our list Joe. I am back on my diet today after those meals!!!
1325219,Jaskonie,2011-07-02 10:35:00,80,"""""If you're not finding fish in Hardeman Bay, down by the big rocks, head down the lake to the ""Y"" and fish the Right side along the wall. Also, the fishing is always good around and into Horwood Lake and the points/ islands around Blueberry island. It's about a 45 min run from the lodge, but worth the trip. """"We had our best luck all around Jesus rocks, and a cut in bay half way down Hardiman on the east bank. Also got into the walleye on the big sand flat at the y 20 fow with harnesses. The biggest Walleye was caught drifting north to south around the lil islands north of Jesus Rock Island. Jig and a minnow. The Walleye were gorging on the 3 inch smelt. We used 3 inch gulp and they worked pretty well all week. Crawlers also worked on white and pink jigs."
1325221,Jaskonie,2011-07-02 10:38:00,80,Fish the sand flat at the Y its probabl a 5 minute run from your camp.
1327400,Guest,2011-07-08 08:52:00,0,"We have a group of 8 guys that have gone up to the lodge for the past 5 years. Fishing has always been great. We always catch lots of fish within seeing distance of the lodge. this year we paid for a guide, just to see more hotspots on the lake. But its hard to beat the area around the lodge when the fish are on, we were catching them one after another. We had a fish fry everynight. No one caught any monster walleye, but they were perfect eating size. We did the housekeeping plan but we had breakfast made for us by the lodge. Next year we are doing the American plan. Food and service was great. Looking forward to coming back next year again."
1330769,Jaskonie,2011-07-17 14:00:00,80,Adempsey what about your trip?
1331188,adempsey,2011-07-18 14:39:00,963,"Our trip was good. The drive to the lodge was good. The gravel road was in relatively good shape, but the rocks did get larger as you drove further toward the lodge so I am not sure when it was graded last. The cabin was very spacious (Joe upgraded us to a larger cabin that was available) and clean. The cabin contained everything we needed to make us comfortable and focus on fishing! The boats were great and the motors even better. I really like the Yamaha engines.The week of our trip was pretty much hot and sunny every day. We had a short storm one day and very little rain on another. The may fly hatch looked like it was either still happening or had just finished as there were may fly nymph skins floating all over the water surface each morning.The first two days we explored various shorelines near the lodge [as we typically do on our trips] focusing on water depths of <20 feet. The area near the lodge was quite deep (30 - 70 feet of water), as was the entire bay in which the lodge was located, so we spent most of the time very close to shore. There were some small shoals that we fish, but had limited success on them. We caught a few small walleye in various spots during this time but not many. Eventually we moved further into the bay near ""Jesus Rock"" as many had suggested. This area had potential since the water was <20 feet deep for a large area. We caught about 15-20 smaller walleye in this spot one evening. However, the other times we went back only resulted in a few fish here and there.Other guests in the lodge were doing better than us so we talked with them about their tactics and locations. Most were simply anchoring in 16 feet and fishing with worms on a jig. They were catching a decent number of walleye each time they went out. We switched tactics a bit and were rewarded with some more fish at various spots along the shoreline.Overall, we managed to catch a decent number of walleye with the largest being 24"" and 26"". We caught a few smaller pike as well. In the end, we had enough 15-16"" fish for one good fish fry as well. The fishing was decent, but I know it could have been much better. Just the luck of the draw sometimes. Perhaps it was the weather or the May flies or just our lack of experience on a lake with a deep basin, but I know people have done much better on this lake than we did. Regardless, we all enjoyed our trip to Horwood Lake Lodge and consider the days on the lake as a learning experience for next time! I'd love to hit one of those outpost lakes at our next visit too!"
1331288,Jaskonie,2011-07-18 17:41:00,80,Sounds like you had a decent trip. The mayfly skins were just starting to surface on the main basin but not hardiman bay when we were there. We had our best luck on a shoal we found past Jesus rocks. We enjoyed our stay at Horwood lake and will be back.
1334113,FrankLeigh,2011-07-26 11:48:00,80,"Glad to hear that most of you guys had good experiences there. We went 5 or 6 years ago and stayed at another camp, not Horwood Lodge. While the camp was clean and well kept, the owner wasn't too helpful. He tried to renege on the quoted price, and then the 16 ft, 15 hp boats that we were supposed to have, were actually 14 ft lightweights with old 9.8 ' s, one of which barely started or ran and he refused to give us another one or fix it until our last day there, then suddenly he couldn""t have been nicer. Maybe male pattern PMS, I don""t know.Also, the owner was not at all helpful with providing info on where to fish. We found fish, but most were too small. Only one fry that week. There was never a line-up for the fish house.We have had some fantastic trips over the years along with some mediocre and some poor ones. Our trip to Horwood was definitely at the bottom end."
1367050,crazyfisher,2011-11-22 07:53:00,25,"Hi All,I had the extreme pleasure of staying with Joe at Horwood Lake Lodge in mid September 2010.I went with my spouse and another couple, the men were the only Fisherman but the ladies still managed to entertain themselve by the beautifull surroundings and abundant trails and wildlife.......oh, and a few bubblies!At the time I was a Chef for a very upscale Winnipeg River fishing resort, so I know first hand how difficult it can be to get on ""the bite"" in a lake you are unfamiliar with.Joe sent us out the evening we arrived and with in actual minutes, we were on the walleye! Not allot of big ones but plentifull keepers. All were caught within yelling distance of the lodge on minnows....however I heard worms are much better on a jig head or spinner/bottom bouncer combination.Yes.......the water WAS very low, but the fish were deffinitely biting! Water levels were in no small part of the actions of the Hydro Dams ( if they admit it or not). I have heard the levels in 2011 are back to normal.We didn't see any of the famous ""floating dead heads"" but understand it's a sight to see....lol.Joe took the 4 of us on an evening boat ride around the lake and we managed to stop at a few of his hot spots...again......good fishing! The lake has very little inhabitants, a few scattered cottages and the only other boats we saw were 6 male guests staying at the Lodge. Very peacefull and tranquil.Our cottage was a 2 bedroom. Cozy and comfortable! The wood stove was an added benifit as the nights were a bit nippie. Everything we needed was supplied. If I had to say what was missing ( from our spouses point of view) was a ""Womans Touch"". But unless you are a family I'm sure you wouldn't even notice.We had the American Plan including breakfast, lunch and dinner. The first night as a Chef, Joe let me prepare the meals for the night....had allot of fun. His kitchen was well equipped with an abundant amount of ingredients to choose from. The second night Joe roasted a wonderful, juicey and tender Prime Rib. Was awesome!!!! Thanks Joe, the food was fabulous!We were well pampered and thanked several times. His quoted price was exactly as we were charged and we also left a considerable tip and well deserved!Now for the best part! Joe's boats are amaizing. 2008 16 footers with a very quiet and very dependable Yamaha 20hp. Started first time every time. The perfect size for this lake. They were also equipped with a live well, anchor and a fish/depth finder. Great job on the boats Joe! By far the best fleet on the lake and probably any surrounding Lodges as well.Thanks again Joe, great hospitality, great spot for a vacation!"
1323131,adempsey,2011-06-27 11:08:00,963,No worries Joe. We are all still really looking forward to our stay at Horwood next week!
1323138,wolves,2011-06-27 11:21:00,11,"Your email says it all Joe, our stays with the lodge were great in the past, I think people deserve honest info. I'm not going to stoop to your level. What I said is true, now I'm sure the others coming will have great trips and great service..which is what all want. Hope 2011 stays great, you have a good lodge and great fishing...we just had an unusual week I guess."
1323170,Golden Eagle,2011-06-27 12:03:00,2642,"I've fished Ontario, a lot, beginning in 1959 and have not run across an outfitter who could ruin my stay. If an issue developed, we handled it and didn't look back. I have the power to make myself happy."
1323202,upeyes,2011-06-27 12:40:00,11,"I agree Golden Eagle, Canadian fishing trip always seem to end up being a lot of fun. I don't think a post relaying one's difficult situation is wrong, and would probably lead to others having the trip of their lives."
1323405,OutfitterJoe,2011-06-27 20:06:00,27,"I would like to know, who ""wolves"" actually is? I approched the group leader, and he denies that it was him, that had made the negative remarks regarding his stay with us. So, Mr. ""Wolves"" make yourself know to me, directly, the email address and toll free number is posted on my web-site..and we'll discuss how my lodge has gone down hill in the past year!"
1323417,wolves,2011-06-27 20:16:00,11,"Your attitude, and yes I will happily call you sometime."
1323424,OutfitterJoe,2011-06-27 20:25:00,27,I'll wait..
1323693,corvette1,2011-06-28 14:07:00,243,i am going to horwood outpost july 16-23 i like to fish that end of the lake post any reports when you get back that would be great
1325054,Jaskonie,2011-07-01 22:18:00,80,"We had a great trip. Lots of Walleye 225-250 fish for our group, a lot of throwbacks but a lot in the 16-17 range. The Camp, boats food and services were outstanding, the best our large group has ever had and a tremendous value for the money. Speaking of money the exchange rate and Canadian gas prices are making it hard on us Americans to justify crossing the border for fishing trips. Thank you to Joe, Billy, Stewie, Michelle, and Big Max for making our stay comfortable and enjoyable."
1325192,OutfitterJoe,2011-07-02 09:37:00,27,"Thanks Jeff, we enjoyed your group, and we all thank You for choosing Horwood Lake Lodge, as your destination for your group of 20+. Kept us all busy for the week, for sure..Hope to have the pleasure of hosting you and the entire group, again next year!!Thanks from all of us, Joe, Mr. Bill, Michelle, Stewart and Max"
1318286,Guest,2011-06-14 13:38:00,0,"Well I booked in 20 guys for our week and I know Joe has thanked me for all of them at least 10 times during the winter and spring. We move around with our big group so we have an open mind. These are the first bad reports on Horwood that I have seen. Keeping our fingers crossed now. By the way we are going through the Souix for the first time, normally we go through Ft. Erie. Any advice on route stops must sees coming and going both in Michigan and Ontario. Any help is appreciated."
1318315,wolves,2011-06-14 15:05:00,11,"We got the usual thanks and can't wait until you get here all winter long...I truely hope we just had the week they didn't feel like doing what they needed to do. We went East to Thessalon and then up to Chapleau. Fill up with gas in the Soo, then between Thessalon and Chapleau there is a nice outpost on the left side with anything extra you need (beer, tackle, gas, etc.). On a good note, the gravel/rock road into the Lodge was graded and in pretty good shape.You'll catch all the fish you want...just move around until you find them off of the points and islands (17-21FOW). There are fish around the lodge, but we found bigger fish farther down and around into the main Horwood Lake.I'm still shaking my head over the experience last week. Many good years there, and this ""off"" year."
1318376,Guest,2011-06-14 17:59:00,0,"Where is the outpost, (route and mile marker if possible)sounds like a good stop. What was the bait of choice for walleye? Again we are hoping for a decent trip. How were the meals?"
1318459,wolves,2011-06-14 22:17:00,11,"We didn't do the meal plan as we stayed on the lake for most of the day. We used crawlers and gulp. Crawlers have always done well, and gulp works well when the fish are hitting. 1/8 oz jigs, metallic colors- unless the wind picks up then move up to a 1/4 to 3/8oz.We've used minnows in past years with good results, but you go through them in a hurry if the fish are hitting."
1318460,wolves,2011-06-14 22:20:00,11,"forgot the outpost- don't have the exact mile marker...it's roughly halfway between the turn at Thessalon and Chapleau. It's the only one on the right as you are traveling North. There is a new outpost that's open on the Left, white in color-but have never stopped there. Gas was $1.35 Liter on the road and $1.60 at the lodge."
1320971,Jaskonie,2011-06-21 14:38:00,80,"Cant wait to get there. Called the camp yesterday and spoke with Stuart, the walleye are biting strong with 16-18 inch class fish biting in front of the camp. Stuart also said the pike bite is picking up. We are going to target the eating fish in the low light hours and fish for the females with wire line and deep divers in the afternoon. Will post a report when we get back. Our gang has 21 guys so we are filling up the camp. Should be fun."
1322145,wolves,2011-06-24 10:31:00,11,"There's a hump out front that comes up to 12ft. Bring a few marker buoys, mark that one for the week, makes it easy with wind. Speaking of wind, anchoring is tough with any wind, no chains on the anchors in the boat.If you want any other info that worked for us, I can PM you with all that worked for us. We found trolling to not work as well as jigging, as most of the fish we caught were off of steep humps and breaks. I'd start down the lake by the ""big rock"". Each side in 17-20ft with crawlers and gold jigs was best for us.Also, some small extension cords (indoor). only 1 or 2 plugs in the whole cabin."
1322246,Jaskonie,2011-06-24 14:31:00,80,Thanks for the info we will give the big rock and the hump out front a try. We will be in camp by 5pm tomorrow.
1322418,adempsey,2011-06-24 22:27:00,963,"Looking forward to your report Jacksonie. Not sure I will get a chance to read anything before I head up to Horwood myself. I actually picked up an anchor system today for this trip [and future trips] so I can try for some summer whitefish. It's just one of those challenges that I want to face, hopefully I have some success.Have a good trip!"
1322544,wolves,2011-06-25 10:12:00,11,"If you're not finding fish in Hardeman Bay, down by the big rocks, head down the lake to the ""Y"" and fish the Right side along the wall. Also, the fishing is always good around and into Horwood Lake and the points/ islands around Blueberry island. It's about a 45 min run from the lodge, but worth the trip."
1313574,wolves,2011-06-01 16:57:00,11,"Anyone been up to Horwood Lake this year yet? Heading up next week, looking for an early season report."
1313592,adempsey,2011-06-01 17:47:00,963,I will also be heading up to Horwood Lake for the first time on July 2nd. We are staying at Horwood Lake Lodge. Would be great to hear how the fishing has been.Make sure you also post a report Wolves =)
1317371,wolves,2011-06-12 10:04:00,11,"Adempsy,I don't have good news for you from Horwood Lake. The operation has gone downhill fast in the last year. We've been going there for many years and were disappointed the entire time. The staff did nearly nothing to make our stay enjoyable. The fishing was tough this year, but this was due to the weather. I can PM you with details, but we'll not be going back to the Horwood Lodge again."
1317513,Guest,2011-06-12 18:38:00,0,Wow what happened we are going up with a large group later in 2 weeks and would like to know what to expect.
1317521,adempsey,2011-06-12 18:53:00,963,"Ugh, sorry to hear you had a bad trip. I'd like to know what happened. Was Gary Stocking still managing it? I noticed his resume and a reference letter online, so maybe he moved on?Jacksonie - what dates will you be there?"
1317719,wolves,2011-06-13 10:16:00,11,"Gary is no longer working there, and that seemed to be part of the problem. Stewart has been put in Gary's spot, but there is still a big hole left. The cabin we had- Animal House- was a wreck..not tuned up for use yet. And not once did any staff stop by and visit or ask if we needed anything, we had a big group and not a single thanks for coming. We had to pull teeth to get Joe and the staff to help. Joe commented to us that it was their ""vacation"" week before they got busy. You now pay for your gas, and Joe backed out of our 10% discount for booking early with more than 5 people, after it was on our invoice.I hope they got the point, as one of guys sent an email after we returned, and your trip is better. I see that problem as $$ and effort from the staff. The lodge is for sale for $525,00, online so that tells the story.Fishing was tough, 2 days of thunderstorms and a 30 degree temp drop. We caught all our fish over around the islands in the main Horwood Lake. There was also alot more logs floating around this year. Good luck!"
1317830,Guest,2011-06-13 13:42:00,0,Our group is filling the camp the weekend of June 25 through July 1. We are looking forward to fishing somewhere different and have talked to Joe recently and he said the fishing has been slow with the males still milking etc. Hopefully when we get in the females will be hitting. No place is perfect and they all seem to be gouging and nickel diming you when the fishing is slow. I bet you wouldnt of posted had the fishing been great.
1317850,retire55,2011-06-13 14:27:00,1029,"It's my opinion that fishermen should always report less than satisfactory trips with outfitters regardless whether fishing was great or not. Fishing message boards provide an excellent opportunity to exchange pertinent and timely information about the fishing, the accommodations, the boats and motors and outfitter services. I'm cognizant that such evaluations will always be very subjective and that readers will have to separate the wheat from the chaff. Excellent outfitters should be rewarded with more business while less than satisfactory outfitters should see their business diminish until corrections/improvements are made."
1318049,adempsey,2011-06-13 22:53:00,963,"I actually asked Joe about the resort being for sale before I booked. He mentioned it's been on the market since he bought it. Not sure if that's true or not, but I knew that ahead of time at least. I also knew about the gas, but I figured since he lowered his prices that paying for the extra gas was probably a given. I talked to another individual on this board that also didn't like the nickel and diming and ended up cancelling his trip [actually, he said that his trip was cancelled for him]. He also lost his deposit. I don't agree with changing your invoice after the fact and that is something I am always afraid of. I've been in situations where owners have tried to pull a fast one on me before as well, but in the end I have always been lucky in that regard. Paying with a credit card often helps as you can challenge it.Well, it's unfortunate your trip didn't work out as you had hoped. It's also quite bad for the resort owner, as you're obviously not returning and I am sure your feedback on here will offer future customers some food for thought. You really can't have poor customer service in this industry, especially during hard economic times.I also hope we don't have any problems on our trip, but it's too late to consider changing it. I am definitely not looking forward to the floating logs, lol! I'll post a report upon my return.Thanks again for the information."
1318241,wolves,2011-06-14 11:41:00,11,"My report from Horwood has nothing to do with slow fishing. We've had great fishing in years past, reflective of nice weather. We caught fish, just not the service we expected as in the past service was good. When was the last time you spent over $3000 and never got a thank you?Also, males still milking is false...the spawn is well over. Joe couldn't tell us anything about where to fish, simply the bite was slow. I'd have good upto date fishing spots line up for customer satisfaction."
