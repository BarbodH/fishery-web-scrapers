1365922,fishincrazy,2011-11-17 08:23:00,1282,I used this for a couple of years and I liked it too!I still like braid better.FC
1365934,retire55,2011-11-17 08:57:00,1029,"I changed from mono to 8/3 Crystal Fireline a few years back for jigging and slip bobbering walleye. In both cases, I use fluorocarbon leaders. Very satisfied."
1366068,Pikeslayer8,2011-11-17 15:01:00,1460,"I believe that line invisibility is critical. I also fish in a dark tea-stained lake. For that reason I like Stren's Easy Cast, coffee colored line. I also am not afraid to use Cajun Red. Nice cheap line for jiggin. I guess I would much rather use a red line over clear or green anyday as the color red is the first color of the spectrum to disappear underwater in fish's vision.I did try Berkley's new Nanofil this fall on Caribou on my trolling rod. I really enjoyed fishing with it in the short time I used it. Casts like a rocket and is very round and slick. I wish I would of caught some fish with it. You do have to make dam sure of your knot.I've used Vanish many times but I've found myself falling out of love with it. Just too brittle. I've heard good things about Power-Pro from others but will never use it where I fish unless it's on my pike rod. My bro-in-law used it a few years ago and said it was like using a nylon rope. Soon as he respooled with his fireline, he was back to slayin em like his usual self."
1366131,Bigstorm,2011-11-17 18:51:00,799,"I like the orange sufix, 8lb for jigging. most of the waters I fish are stained brown so the orange blends in pretty well and gives great visibility out of the water"
1366137,Rich B,2011-11-17 18:57:00,1081,"I also switched over to Power Pro a few years ago, and like the low vis green. XL was my choice before Power Pro and not bad, though I like Power Pro better as it doesn't twist and more sensitive. Rich B"
1366149,AllenW,2011-11-17 19:36:00,11482,"Favorite line...sure, two walleyes sitting in a boat drunk out of their minds, local CO officers stop them and tell them they're under arrest, then look at each other and tell the walleyes to leave.Bit later one walleye looks at the other and asks why they were let go?Other one says, ""easy, they practice catch and release here"".......Favorite fishing line would be Stren clear blue in 4-8# test, Suffix bright yellow, same tests and probably 10-12# Power Pro if fishing heavy jigs in deep (30-35') water or casting hard baits.Not completely sold on the PP and may try the Suffix Performace braid next time.Al"
1366280,SoulFulCry,2011-11-18 10:34:00,158,"favorite lines are 8&10lb berkley sensation great feel n no memory also less stretch that reg mono,i started using suffix 832 braid for trolling n now am impressed with it to the point im goin to get rid of my fireline n go all 832 for trolling maybe even try the 6/2 for rigging n jigging"
1366353,tyson2925,2011-11-18 15:47:00,95,"I like Sufix 832 6/20. Tipped with 12# p-line fluoro. Once I found braid I have never looked back, stronger, no memory, no stretch, when you tighten nots you dont burn your line and lasts for a long time. (832 holds its shape better than fireline after extended use I have found)"
1366359,zman8701,2011-11-18 15:57:00,100,"My favorite line for jigging walleyes is flurocarbon. I have reels spooled with sensation and mono, just depends what I'm fishing for and what I'm fishing with."
1366700,Moondog,2011-11-20 15:54:00,362,"Power Pro 8# or Trilene XL. Used each last year for jigging but in different applications. Generally I use Power Pro hands down but when the bite is off or the water exceptionally still or clear, then XL."
1365786,tsquared,2011-11-16 16:21:00,57,"Seems like I had quite a bit of line tangle / memory issues this year. I do a pretty good job of changing line, so I don't think it is an age issue. I normally use trilene XL, but tried trilene XT to see if I fared any better. I do use backing but make sure I am not over-spooled, etc. Any favorite line's or suggestions to reduce the memory issues. Thanks."
1365794,fishinnut 3446,2011-11-16 16:51:00,638,"My vote would have to be for 6-8 lb. p-line,great line,super strong!"
1365797,fishincrazy,2011-11-16 17:00:00,1282,"I like braid fireline,power pro,and suffix preformance braid.No memory so no tangle.Try one of these out.The other good thing is these braids last a long time.I have braid on a fresh water stick the is 4 years old and still in fine shape.Just remember if spooling with braid you need to first put mono on your reel arbor to avoid slipping.Also braid has a smaller diameter so you can use heavier line with the same diameter.Give it a shot you might just like it!!FC"
1365800,jdoaks,2011-11-16 17:03:00,89,"I know alot of you dont like it but spiderwire is my favorit. its strong, thin and almost no memory. I fish from lake erie to quebec."
1365824,JayM5209,2011-11-16 19:31:00,1050,"Go back to the XL, it's got less memory than the XT. At the 1st sign of any twist, do the ""remove all hardware and trail behind the boat"" routine to remove it. 6# or 8# for jigging and casting or trolling cranks, 10# for bottom bouncing and lake trout fishing. Remove five feet periodically to get rid of any nicks, and strip off 50 or 60 feet at the beginning of each season. After three or four years, strip all line off the reels and refill.It's worked fine for me for the last 20 years."
1365865,rebs,2011-11-17 06:25:00,7587,"my favorite line is Berkley Sensation, its the best I have ever used"
1365866,geareng,2011-11-17 06:27:00,335,I second the vote for p-line 6# cxx. Switched years ago from xl and I find that I have far less breakoffs and also I have lost less jigs when I get hung up from the line breaking while trying to free the jig. Great line.
1365868,new hips,2011-11-17 06:33:00,498,"Use Crystal Fireline,you can see it where it enters the water so you can detect the lite biters. When jigging, use a small swivel and 18in of 6lb Florocarbon on the jig."
1365905,wallydave,2011-11-17 07:52:00,2151,"Berkley Vanish and Spiderwire have worked well for me. Fireline is strong enough to bring in pike on my ultralight, but I like Vanish or the Spiderwire better. Has anyone tried Northlands walleye line? I feel like giving it a try one one of my walleye rigs next year. Next year, that would be only 211 days to go!"
1365906,JOHN L. HECKLSMILLER,2011-11-17 07:55:00,629,"I struggled with the ""Twisting/Pig Tailing"" mono for a number of years. Started with ""Fireline"" about 10 years ago, & then progressed to ""Power Pro"" 5 years ago. I discovered a new line, introduced this year, by ""Power Pro"" called: ""Depth Hunter"", it is still a braided line, put because I ""Longline"" so much, the ""Depth Hunter"" line is color coded every 25'. There are 4 colors used for a 100' run & & then they repeat. This system eliminates the unreliable ""Line Counter Reels"" that I previously used. As mentioned earlier, the braided lines are of a much smaller diameter with larger line weights, & they do not have memory. I also use ""Power Pro"" for my casting rods. No more frustrations with the line! It would be worth a try. Set the Hook, CRJohn"
