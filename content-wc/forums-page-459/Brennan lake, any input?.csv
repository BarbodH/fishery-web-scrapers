1307034,Bluff,2011-05-15 09:06:00,152,I replied to your PM... you never sent me your email address. I'll try to get you something in the next few days.
1366476,Bluff,2011-11-19 10:22:00,152,I sent PM to you... what happened at Brennan? Any of my GPS points work? I am heading up there next June and would appreciate feedback. Thanks!
1117732,boostnut,2009-07-01 10:16:00,9,"We've got a good sized group planning to head back to canada next june (2010). Not only is it a little late to be scheduling for june but our group size is aprox. 15 guys. From what I've found there are not too many outfitters capable of putting us all up in 1 camp. Found Brennan thru Rusty Meyers, anybody have any input for us. They claim big northern and average walleye w/good numbers. Thats fine with us, just looking for any additional information on the lake and/or outfitter. Also interested in other outfitters capable of handling 15 people on 1 lake, prefer at 1 camp but beggers cant be choosers. Only real concern is we'd like to fly out of the Ft. Francis area not spend hours and hours driving in canada. Thanks in advance!"

1117948,boostnut,2009-07-02 06:25:00,9,"Joeman, funny you mention that. We went to Lil Shab with them last year and were leaning toward Wabakimi for our next trip. Problems seems to be that June is a popular month to be on Wabakimi, its almost 100% booked. Have not given Birch much attention yet, should look into that. NWO was great, would love to give them the business again."
1118180,Bluff,2009-07-03 08:24:00,152,"boostnut - I stayed at Brennan through Rusty Meyers in late May early June 2008. It is a great place for a group your size. It was the only time I have been to Brennan and it took some time to get into a lot of fish but we did it. The late ice-out didn't help. We had a group of eight guys - a few things about Brennan: a fantastic live well in the house down by the dock that kept dozens of minnows alive for everal days; several comfortable cabins and a GREAT big cabin with a fireplace for eating, socializing, etc (really nice); a real nice flat rock area for a fire at night (w/ benches); keep in mind one thing - Rusty reserves the right to put multiple groups into Brennan unless you arrange ahead of time that your the only group or you have enough in your group where another group won't comfortably fit. You probably have enough guys. Brennan also has several outhouses. With 15 guys your group will require at least two planes, so, they'll be a little more liberal on the weight per person issue. Overall, a real nice place for a large group - I highly recomend it. Plenty of Pike and Walleye. If you go I could point you to some spots."

1233852,phishfearme,2010-09-07 18:14:00,1242,take a look at thousand lakes - they have a 16 man luxury cabin with three lakes to fishhttp://www.thousandlakesoutposts.com...Accommodations phish
1234054,Bluff,2010-09-08 11:43:00,152,"I can't add a whole lot more than what I stated earlier in this thread other than to say a GPS will be helpful - especially with the number of people in your group. It is easy to get confused north and east of the camp if you haven't been there before. Otherwise, it is a nice camp with good facilities."
1236824,esigurd,2010-09-20 14:26:00,3,Thanks for the GPS advice for Brennan. Any information you can provide on the areas that produced for you would be appreciated. Can you send me an e-mail with a scanned map marked with places to catch fish? Let me know and we can exchange e-mail addresses.
1238044,thunderatwork,2010-09-24 14:59:00,79,"been thru rusty seven times on three different lakes. love the shorter drive just to fort francis, food package, cabins are top notch,(been on other fly-in outfitters) never been to brennan however. didn't go at all this year, due to wife commitments. trying to get geared up for next year which will be thru rusty again, not sure which lake? I like to move around abit and explore. been to granite and wabakimi which are just downstream from brennan(i think). fishing was to good on wabakimi, needed more bait flown in. and we thought we had plenty. run by a woman, which, being a old man, i think leads to slighly better outhouses than some other places i've been."
1238436,Bluff,2010-09-26 09:42:00,152,"I sent you a PM regarding GPS coordinates. Also, I flew over Brennan (on way to Wabakimi) in June and the lake was noticeably lower than I have seen before. True of most areas around there. But I have heard that the levels have come up. It would affect how you get to some areas."
