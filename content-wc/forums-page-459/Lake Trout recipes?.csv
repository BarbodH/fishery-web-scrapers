1361788,wallydave,2011-10-31 12:07:00,2151,"Since we have a lake trout thread, how about one for how to cook them after thier caught?We tried a couple different ways to cook lakers, broiled, in cooking bags, but my favorite method was the simplest. Take the fillets, no skin thank you, a hot iron skillet, and pepper and blackening spices. Spice up both sides, cook on both sides until flaky, serve with beer, n beans! The Cuban cigar and single malt are after dinner options!"
1361798,camp chef,2011-10-31 12:45:00,915,"We soak the whole fish in milk for a couple hours then stuff with tarragon and sliced lemons,salt and pepper and wrap in tin foil. Cook on grill or bake in the oven at 350 for an hour or so depending on the size of the fish."
1361807,JayM5209,2011-10-31 13:15:00,1050,"Dave, thanks for kicking off this thread.My all time favorite is to bake the laker whole. Remove head and guts, thoroughly rinse, then pat dry with paper towels. Place whole fish in a large baking dish or pan, salt and lemon pepper both sides. On top, cover with thinly sliced onions and lemon slices and generously add pats of butter. Cover with foil and seal tightly. Bake about 40 minutes at 350 degrees. Skin will lift right off the top, as will the meat. When you're ready for the 2nd side, just lift out the backbone and rib cage - they'll come right off in one piece. If you don't have a large baking dish in camp, this can also be done in a foil wrap. Also, a sprig of dill on top and a cup of dry white wine in the pan makes a nice addition.My 2nd favorite way to do lakers is with an orange and honey marinade. Fillet the fish and remove ribs and skin. Cut the fillets into serving size peieces - 2.5""-3"" wide - and place into a gal. sized ZipLoc bag. Mix up a marinade of 1/3 cup soy sauce, 1/3-1/2 cup orange juice, 1/4 cup honey, 2 thinly sliced green onions (or equivalent amount of diced yellow onion), 3 T. oil (olive or other veg. oil), and the zest of one orange. Add the marinade to the bag, expel as much air as possible, and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours, turning every 20 minutes or so. Preheat oven to 375 and bake on cookie sheet (with sides) or a baking pan just until done, i.e., easily flakes with a fork. Don't over cook!! You can also do this under the broiler . . . but watch it closely so the fish doesn't get over done and dried out.Enjoy!!"

I use a Hy-Vee concoction which is very good. Fish is done when it flakes to a twisted fork. Simple and delicious! Bill Krejca"
1361844,briand,2011-10-31 15:30:00,48,"So many ways of doing up a lake troutSteaking them and on the bbq is always a treat - a little olive oil and what ever spice you likeTrout fillets under the broiler with a little bit of mayo spead on top and again your fav spice is goodWe smoke a few each year.We've done coho salmon, pike, sucker and lakers at the same time, and laker was almost as good as the salmonAnd of course for x-mass eve ( meatless night ) we take our biggest trout and stuff with wild rice and bakeAll those others sound real good tooWill have to try"
1362743,Guest,2011-11-03 23:16:00,0,"Fillet the trout leaving the skin on. Place fillets on a baking pan skin side down. Spread a thin layer of Hellmann's mayo over fillets and sprinkle whatever seasonings you like over the meat (lemon pepper, paprika, garlic powder, etc). Broil til the mayo starts to brown then reduce heat to 350 and bake til done (approx 30 min depending on thickness of fillet). Sprinkle with parsley. This recipe has made many of our trout hating friends into trout lovers"
1362894,new hips,2011-11-04 13:48:00,498,"Freshly caught in Ontario waters the lakers were hard to distinguish from the walleye. We tried several ways, one was deep fried in beer batter, just a little softer....but yummy (only used small ones 3-4 pounds) The other was baked with onion/ couple slabs of butter and seasoning(lemon pepper salt)on the grill."
1363458,rpieske,2011-11-07 16:51:00,1276,Try poaching them in a skillet of boiling water. Just filet the trout and add Old Bay Seasoning to the water. Discovered this by accident when we broke the bottle of oil for frying the trout nearly 40 years ago. Poor man's lobster.

1365761,AllenW,2011-11-16 13:09:00,11482,"Nothing fancy, just fillet and cut into sections, then dip the skinless fillets into a mixture of egg and milk, then into a large baggie with 3/4 white flour, 1/4 frying magic and a bit of salt and pepper to taste.Shake to cover.Then place a strip of tin foil on the grill and add enough butter to fry the fillets in, get hot then add the fillets and grill till just starting to brown, flip over do the same and serv.If you clarify the butter it will burn less easily imhoI think you could deep fry them this way too.Al"
