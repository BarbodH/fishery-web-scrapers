1363673,Harvey_Cochrane,2011-11-08 13:04:00,19,I was happy to do some guiding on the English River this past summer and I tell you all that this is one of my favorite places to fish because of the shear numbers of fish and the different techniques used to catch ole marble eyez....it's like a big practice ground for trying new techniques or refining your skills. If you can learn how to fish a river then you'll have no problem fishing lakes. I used to bring lots of jigs to this place but now I can fish all day using one jig if I had to....you really learn how and when to use your boating techniques too. Most of my guiding days were used jig fishing because most of my guests knew how to jig and keep it off bottom and is one of the easiest ways to catch them. There was times when I had experienced fishermen in the boat and we could troll either using bottom bouncer or crank baits. This year I fell in love with the Reef Runner and I believe they are the 800 series or 700 not to sure but the big walleye loved the action it gave. Early in the spring I was catching walleye in water anywhere from 3ft-8ft of water and this is where I learned to bobber fish again...it was so much fun. And of course if any of you know me..I love fishing walleye in weeds and this year was no exception. The weeds came up kinda late but none the less the weed bite still happens all summer long. But of course it's always up to the guest as to what they want to do..either jig or troll but the big fish pattern was trolling in July but like I said in early season it is a lot of fun fishing shallow in the bays or mouths of bays. If anyone wants info on this place...be sure to send me a message.
1363853,Bigstorm,2011-11-09 06:58:00,799,I have fished this same area for the past 7 years (2 trips this year) and have no plans on changing to a different area anytime in the future. It is always a blast fishing here. We jig pretty much the whole time unless we get bored with catching walleyes and do some casting in back bays for northerns . We dont know any great spots for trolling though because of how much the bottom varies and we dont feel like donating Rapalas
1364185,greenie,2011-11-10 11:55:00,87,"This was my fifth trip this past summer and with the water being so low it was like fishing a lake. Was by far the best fishing I've had in the five years. I just love this area! The fish seemed to average 14-16"". Not many saugers were caught this year and the size of walleyes and northerns were just unreal."
1364847,Biggerbear,2011-11-13 08:50:00,13,"Google this and you may be as shocked as I was. Such a nice area almost destroyed, but is it completely say yet ? I loved fishing these water and still would, but at my age the drive is not for me. Not trying to scare anyone just educate them, if you take young kids be sure you are ok with them eating the fish. Years from now you may regret that choice -- Mercury Rising: The Poisoning of Grassy Narrows"
1364964,Bigstorm,2011-11-13 18:34:00,799,"If I recall correctly, most of the mercury came into this system during the 70's and 80's thru the Wabigoon river. I thought they even closed down any tourism in the area for a while. I think it was opend back up in the mid 90's.I could be wrong on some of that but I cant imagine that eating a few walleye while up there and bringing my limit of 4 back would cause health concerns. If the levels were toxic in each fish, I would think the fish itself would be dead."
1366869,Biggerbear,2011-11-21 13:16:00,13,"News Release : April 6, 2010Mercury Still Killing in Grassy NarrowsShocking health study confirms Native health concerns; questions Health Canada guidelinesToronto - The health impacts of mercury poisoning in Grassy Narrows people are worse now than in the1970's, say the shocking results of a newly translated health study by Japanese mercury expert Dr.Harada. The translated study is being released today on the 40th anniversary of when Ontario firstbanned fishing on the Wabigoon River due to mercury contamination by the Dryden paper millupstream. The study finds that Health Canada safety guidelines are too weak to protect people from thecumulative long-term health impacts of low level mercury exposure, which is now ubiquitous worldwidedue to industrial pollution from sources such as coal burning power plants."
1367585,Bigstorm,2011-11-24 06:38:00,799,"good to know I, but it wont keep me from fishing there. I cant imagine that eating a few walleyes while I'm there and bringing my 4 home would cause much harm to myself, I bet I do more damage to my liver while I'm up there,"
1367966,Harvey_Cochrane,2011-11-26 11:28:00,19,Yes..your right...there's nothing wrong with the fishing there especially when that happen 40 years ago. I been eating the fish for years and not nothing wrong with me. If you would like to know some good trolling places..I can help you out. Out of all the places I've fished and guided on over the years..English River is still the best quantity fishery I been on and Rainy Lake is my new fave lake for quality. English River is just plain fun to fish because of all the possible techniques used to catch walleye...everyday could be different. To me the fun is finding new spots and techniques.
