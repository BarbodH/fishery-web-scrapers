1364927,bpetersen,2011-11-13 15:57:00,251,Has anyone on here been turned around flying into Winnipeg from the US with a DUI? I have heard being refused at the border but not at customs at the airport in Winnipeg. I did a search but nothing showed up.
1364962,Bigstorm,2011-11-13 18:30:00,799,"I had a friend that was turned away at the airport in Montreal. After getting off of the plane, and getting to the customs desk they denied him entry and he had to sit and wait for the next plane back to the US. They wouldnt even let him plug his cell phone in to charge it"
1364978,Jesse-WI,2011-11-13 19:38:00,534,The same rules apply regardless of plane or car.
1364984,bpetersen,2011-11-13 20:08:00,251,I was just curious if they would not do as many background checks flying into Canada. bigdog
1365001,Jesse-WI,2011-11-13 20:58:00,534,I do not think it improves your chances since you must use a passport when entering the country via air. That makes it real easy for them to look at your whole life
1365092,SinOrSwim,2011-11-14 09:24:00,1528,My sister-in-law tried to go to Toronto a few months ago and got turned back because of a DUI. She didn't know they even had the rule.
1365190,bpetersen,2011-11-14 14:49:00,251,"Thanks all, I have a person in our fishing group for next spring that has a DUI and he is thinking the airport route would be less chance to get turned around. Sounds like that may not be the case."
1365228,JETSTER,2011-11-14 16:04:00,448,What is the major problem with letting in someone with a DUI?WHY?????
1365246,bigwalleye1,2011-11-14 16:55:00,2632,"The major problem with not letting someone into Canada with a DUI is: That's their law. It's their country, and their border. Not trying to be harsh, but that's the way they do choose to set laws and do their business. While a lot of folks are willing to weigh in with opinions, some agreeing, some not, some criticizing, I don't think our opinions here on the subject will change anything, nor help the Original Poster."
1365250,mrpike57,2011-11-14 17:01:00,97,"The problem is you can not enter Canada if you are a convicted felon. In Canada, dui is a felony. If it is 5 years since your conviction, you can fill out paperwork and apply for entry into Canada. There is a particular form that you fill out, have to have police record check, send with check to Canadian consulate in New york City, takes about 6 months."
