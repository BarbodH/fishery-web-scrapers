You will not regret checking it out, they are family orientated and you can catch walleyes off the dock if need be for the kids. Fishing is awesome also! Amenities are top notch."

We fished off of some docks on Batchawana Bay and caught smallies just about every cast. The thing I liked about it is we were able to take my son to the Soo to watch the freighters in the locks. Plus they had a tugboat parade on the river, I think it was for Canada Day. One of his favorites was Theodore Tugboat at the time so it worked out well."
1365011,JCsGoneFishin,2011-11-13 23:08:00,34,"Hey folks, Would like to take my family to experience Canada. My family= wife - fishing is new but interesting, son 10 yrs who likes to fish in 4 hr increments, son 4 yrs who, as all 4 yr olds, has an attention span of about 30 seconds to 3 hours depending on what he is doing. Maybe I am asking a lot.. My ?s: What is a good place to go in Canada where: We stay in a clean cabin/lodge with indoor plumbing...??? There are things to do for said kids, besides fishing, that they would think is cool...??? Has great fishing for the times I can get them interested...??? Boats are provided...??? I live in the Chicago suburbs. I take an annual trip with friends to Canada via the Soo. So a few hr drive from there or in N. Minnesota would be best.... Would love the help of this board..... Am I asking too much?"

1365110,LOW1,2011-11-14 10:24:00,2828,"There are a number of great family friendly resorts on Lake of the Woods. A twelve hour drive would get you to the Sioux Narrows area. Tomahawk resort would be a good option, and there are others. Close enough to Kenora which has a movie theater, indoor pool, a great Farmer's Market on Wednesdays, etc. Check out the websites for the various places and talk to the owners. You will find one that fits your needs."
