1423473,ii4me,2012-04-19 16:00:00,20,We are contemplating bringing in frozen shiner for our Lac Seul trip in early June. Does anyone use or have used frozen shiners? If so how were your results?
1423698,icenut59,2012-04-20 06:55:00,8,GREAT! We've done it for years. Out fish live bait by a long shot. We freeze them in Borax bleach. Biggest problem is remembering to take them out of the cooler soon enough so they are not still frozen when trying to use them.
1423721,ii4me,2012-04-20 07:36:00,20,I am just curious about the Borax Bleach. What does it do for the freezing process?

1423904,plumberjoe,2012-04-20 15:01:00,54,They work great we have been bringing them up for a couple years now.
1424051,Knoxabilly,2012-04-20 20:47:00,225,How does one contact this guy in Ear Falls?
1424058,Guest,2012-04-20 22:10:00,0,This is where it gets kind of weird. The frozen shiner guy in Ear Falls lives on the same road that four seasons bait shop is on. I believe it's the first house on the left. Knock on the front door and tell him Doug sent you. That's what we say anyway!
1424137,cuamb,2012-04-21 07:31:00,203,I also put them in Borax soap. Appartently the Borax soap is a preservative. They do not dry out as much as the salted minnows. My biggest walleye to date is 29 inches (released) and that was on a frozen Borax minnow.
