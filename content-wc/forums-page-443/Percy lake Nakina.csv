Minnows are available at Leuenberger's base. For pike you can try spoons or rapallas. The lake goes down to about 30-40' in spots. There are two rivers coming in the westend of the lake which provides good fishing. Get a map with fishing spots on it when you arrive at Leuenberger's. They run a top notch operation."
