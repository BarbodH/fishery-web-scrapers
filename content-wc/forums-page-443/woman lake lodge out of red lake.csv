You do not boat in from Red Lake, you boat in from a public launch on the Woman River system. You get there by taking a gravel road approx 35 miles out of Ear Falls. The camp is approx 30 miles from the landing. It is remote but not isolated, there are other camps, outpost and private cabins on this system. Far from crowded, but you will see other boats. I believe the camp is under new ownership, and there was a post last year from someone who had a good experience at WLL."
1414967,HeHooksHimself,2012-04-01 19:31:00,725,"Wolf, I have been there several times. The chain is pretty heavily fished as there is a drive up boat ramp. I assume you meant Woman River Camp and if so, you won't find nicer hosts than paul and Deb. Cabins are in good shape and his equipment is good. At times there is a lot of traffic there and quite a few private cabins on the chain. fishing is good, but when it turns off you have to know where to go, Paul will sure help you. rates are very reasonabe. Takes a while to get anywhere and you really can't come back for lunch if you go to some of the spots we like, Little Woman and Big Woman. Other choices on this chain are Canadian north lodge, which may or may not be open. That place caters to high rollers as every day is guided and American plan only last i heard. Then there is Big Woman Lake Lodge, which you may have been referring to. i know nothing about them but Big Woman Lake is an excellent fishery. it is also available from Woman River Camp. you will have fun, bring chartreuse!"
1415026,LLewellin,2012-04-01 21:30:00,1790,"I stayed at WLL last September and had a blast. http://www.womanlakelodgecanada.com/ It is under new ownership as of last July. Very nice people. The camp is very rustic but that is what I want. Clean cabins with gas stoves, wood heat & elec. lights. We only saw two other boats in 5 days middle of September. We caught tons & tons of nice eyes. We have already booked for this year. I would suggest not bringing your boat for the first trip and actually we will not bring our boat again this year.... no need. YOu will go about 35-40 miles on gravel and then 25-30 miles by boat. They pick you up at their landing. With out knowing the entire chain and rout to get to their camp I could see myself losing a lower unit on my boat and glad I left it at home. Plus saved a ton of gas cash not towing my boat all the way up there. They have 14' boats with 15 hp motors which was perfect for two people. We did bring our own depth finder/GPS. Can't wait to get there again!"
1415104,Mohleye,2012-04-02 07:47:00,368,"Just to clarify....Woman River Camp which Hehookshimself refers to is located near the landing where Woman Lake Lodge picks their guests up. You can drive right to Woman River Camp. Woman Lake Lodge is a 30 mile boat ride from this landing. So both camps are on the same system, just 30 miles apart by water."
1423330,Guest,2012-04-19 10:59:00,0,dear sir thanks for your help on woman lake lodge we have deceided in september to fisg woman river camp out of ear falls owner is paul jim wolf
1423338,HeHooksHimself,2012-04-19 11:07:00,725,"I have fished the woman river system out of Woman River Camp several times. Paul and Debbie (and Val and Timber) are awesome people. I will bet Paul doesn't have an enemy in the world. The main system is big and paul will share the hotspots with you. You will not be nickled and dimed at this camp as everything is included. Try some of the free portage trips for new and different adventures during the week. Snakeweed produces good sized walleye and constant action. Corliss is quite a hike, but we have caught plenty of walleye and a 38"" pike there. We love taking on the smallies in Little Woman and Big Woman is large and has lakers in the spring and good walleye action with some big mamas. Chartreuse is a required color there and jigs with bump, flash or noise work pretty well. We generally use plastic baits here with the walleye electric chicken being the ""go to"" bait one of our trips. Have fun and tell Paul hello from Jeff and Norm."
