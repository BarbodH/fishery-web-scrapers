We were informed that the ""border guards"" (we all pictured GI Joe-style guys with bazookas and machine guns) might ask us to recite it, and we could be left behind if we messed up even a single word. At a minimum, we were told that it would be a great insult to our canadian friend who owned the camp if we were unable to produce the words when he asked us. Boy did we study and memorize! ""All for justice and liberty, with God under nation one, stands it which for republic, . . . . "" I still havent forgotten it to this day.A few years ago, my son and daughter started learning the same lines before their first trip, although they didnt take it nearly as seriously as I did.Hopefully in twenty years, it will be my Grandkids that feel the pressure!!"

There was a lot of algae on the water there.I asked what it was and my uncle told me it was ""green moose poop.""That night we called my mom. I was excited to tell her that there was green moose poop everywhere."
