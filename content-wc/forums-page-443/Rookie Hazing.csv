BTW, ours is to go to Bobby's in Vermilion Bay for our licenses and tell the rookie to go first but to mention to ""Bobby"" that he looks tired (or stressed or grumpy or sleepy-it is all the same). Those of you who know what i am talking about know what will inevitably happen!"
1420857,bigdaddy66,2012-04-14 06:28:00,7,When we cross the border with a rookie everyone sets their watch ahead 1 hour like we have crossed a time zone. We then try to get him to talk about it on the stops we make on the way to camp and at camp. We have had a lot of fun with this.
1420892,TinCann,2012-04-14 07:51:00,8,All our Rookies are required to eat at least one .
1420904,HeHooksHimself,2012-04-14 08:20:00,725,I would not even know where to get a pickled turkey gizzard!
1420910,Pikeslayer8,2012-04-14 08:53:00,1460,"When my sons and nephews become of the age to enter the rite of passage of manhood and are included, we tell them the first thing that must be done is to wax the boats. Well, when our youngsters arrive in camp for the first time and see the old leaky tinnys, well lets just say that the realization of it all occurs. I'm not sure, but I think it was just my boys who asked, ""Where do we keep the wax"". Its at this point where we show them the can crusher is. First time kids get the responsibility of crushing cans and non burnables and bagging them up to fly out with us."
1420953,Ten Horse Johnson,2012-04-14 11:54:00,235,"No real hazing, but we jokingly refer to that person as ""camp squaw"" and on the drive up will tell him that he's responsible for all cleaning, cooking and other domestic duties. Just verbal hazing I suppose."
1421476,muskyman73,2012-04-16 02:59:00,402,"We made ( or rather paid ) my cousin to eat a giant leech we found free swimming up in Stevens Bay at LOTW. We all put some cash down, told him he has to keep in down and he did it. Washed it down, with a beer, almost dry heaved, manned up and kept it in. This is just one of the many things that I can type on a public forum and the rest....... well lets just say I claim the 5th ! This year I have something planned of epic proportions and we are going to video this one. I am so awful but something about seeing my relatives make fools out of themselves and throwing up in the process really makes my Canada trip every year. If Jared only knew what went on in that cabin ! LOL !"
1424067,Guest,2012-04-21 04:00:00,0,"I've met Bobby, two years ago, and I'm old enough to know better. Thanks Coach."
1424084,Golden Eagle,2012-04-21 05:46:00,2642,"Actually your first date with Bobby was May 13, 2011. Are you looking forward to a rematch next month?"
1424091,Whopper,2012-04-21 06:10:00,340,Your no rookie and that guy you travel with should have protected you lol
