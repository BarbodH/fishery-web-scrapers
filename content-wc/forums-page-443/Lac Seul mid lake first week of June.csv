I know that things change from year to year, but does anyone have any experience fishing around that time? Do you fish ends of islands, coves, or a particular area during that time?"
1423317,Mike Willems,2012-04-19 10:29:00,4,"Most anglers would be surprised by the number of main lake spawners present on the central section of Lac Seul. By the first week of June these walleyes are usually finishing up the spawn and along with the first waves of post spawn migration fish from the rivers, begin to move into our traditional springtime areas.At this time of year, specific macro structure is much less important to walleye location than water temperature. If the main lake is 45 - 50 degrees and you can find water that is pushing into or above 60 degrees, then you are well on your way to finding active walleyes. Smaller structural elements will still concentrate fish in a specific spots, but water temperature is the key. Once we've found fish we look for inside curves in a shoreline, old creek beds, transitions from rock to clay or sand, the remains of last year's weedbeds, and changes in grade or slope of a shoreline. Clay stained water often warms much more quickly than clear water and we often target the dirtiest water we can find.Warm water areas of the lake occur where large areas of relatively shallow water are isolated from the main lake. We look for neck down areas, locations near expansive bogs and marsh, and areas that stay wind protected from the cool water of the main lake. Many of our productive areas have the same ""sound."" Because they are near marshes and bogs you can hear the constant peeping of spawning frogs and toads.Because of the variation in lake level, specific productive locations change dramatically from year to year on Lac Seul. One thing does stay the same, warm water draws hordes of baitfish into the shallows, and the big walleyes are never far behind.Mike WillemsSilver Water Wheel Lodge"

I usually fish the NW end of LS, in mid-June depending on the spawn, the walleyes can be coming out of the creeks and rivers, heading into deeper water. Temps and water levels will come into play. Windy points are worth a try, deeper water might be holding fish. Check with your lodge operator, they will have the latest feedback, keep checking here, plus try the search function on the tool bar above. If yiy mention your camp, that might help with getting replies from folks that have fished out of the same place. Good luck! Our group is only 58 days away from fresh walleye!"
