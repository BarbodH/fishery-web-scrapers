1395377,HeHooksHimself,2012-02-16 17:14:00,725,"Perhaps you are right. There is still something to the red boat syndrome. WLC is the only camp on the Wine Lake system and with a max of about 11 boats. The expectation is that you will have more solitude. in order for Wabby resort daytrippers to get into the system they have to portage their boats over the ramp that Herb built and maintains. While he must allow anyone to use it to have it there, any damage will only be taken care of by him. The WLC boats usually come in as a group and help each other over the ramp. H & A monitor the users of their camp and really preach fish conservation and the reward has been for the fishery to get better and better each year. I have seen a few posts by Wabby fishermen, like the one above, saying their trip into the Wine Lake system was the highlight of their trip. I 'm just saying that if that's the case perhaps they should book at WLC if that is the experience they are seeking. I don't know of a single instance of a WLC guest daytripping over to Wabby. I wonder why? But I still love you."
1395455,UKBDM,2012-02-16 19:50:00,178,We stay at Jim and Julies at the south end of the lake and very seldom travel that far north so I have never used the WLC ramp/portage. I'm a little surprised that more of the daytrippers from Wabby haven't started staying at WLC with that kind of fishing success many of them have experienced. I know I would!Your characterization of Wabby fishermen is what irritated me but it probably shouldn't have. I take pride in the way I treat other fisherman and I don't exceed limits or sacrifice my ethics when in pursuit of good fishing. I think you are probably the same sort of guy. Don't know that I would be as possessive of a natural resource but maybe I would if I fished at WLC.My boat is not red but if you see a fall marsh Lund Fury with a camo Mercury on the back it might be me! Be kind. I'm not that good of fisherman.BTW ... I love you too!
1398738,trapper_john,2012-02-24 14:21:00,83,"This will be our eighth year on Wabbie, sixth or seventh at Kingfisher. My wife loves the camp. Jerry and Linda are super nice and Lester, dock guy and all around right hand, is great. We always pull our own boat but the equipment they supply is first rate. It's a friendly camp and people have always been more than willing to share the hot spots. I don't know about the other camps because I've never had a reason to change."
1398786,Big Mike,2012-02-24 16:55:00,35,I too stay at Jim and Julies but would recommend any of the resorts on the lake from what I have seen and heard. I go 5 weeks a year throughout the season and enjoy fishing the lake throughout these different times because of the way the fish change locations and tactics used as they move. If you enjoy shallow walleyes choose late may or early june and use slip bobbers or light jigs. Late june you can use light jigs or spinners/crawlers. Late july we start to vertical jig reefs and also pull cranks over open water. August we really start to vertical jig the reefs and weedlines. September is really good for jigs also. The point is...you should do well on Wabaskang if you are willing to adapt your style of fishing to the bite thats working during that time of year. If you need more help don't be afraid to ask! Northerns??? all year long... Smallies??? I'd shoot for June as the best bite but July is often good too.
1398790,Big Mike,2012-02-24 17:05:00,35,"As far as the Wine Lake conversation...I do not travel into Wine for a couple reasons...1) the fishing is fantastic on Wabaskang and I hate to leave it, 2)I have my own boat too large to portage and Jim and Julies is a long ways away from the portage. However, if I stayed at Peffleys camp I would be crazy NOT to go into there at least once! I highly doubt his red boats cause problems down there because they have never caused me any problems on Wabaskang. I think you just need to realize that you do not own the lake and you portaged into it the same way they do also! If you truly want to be left ""alone"" I would suggest booking a trip to a fly-in lake that does not have access like Wine does. In addition...as I'm fishing on Wabaskang I frequently encounter your boats coming and going back to the landing where you keep your vehicles. I have never once complained about having to stop fishing the ""narrows"" or other areas as your procession motors past us...in fact I usually comment how lucky you are to be going into Wine for a week! Please remember that you also use the same waters (Wabaskang) to access your lake that we are fishing on while you motor through. Enjoy your vacation and don't get worked over the little things brother! PS...all this talk about Wine makes me want to go rent a boat from Peffleys for a day and make a trip now!"
1398814,HeHooksHimself,2012-02-24 18:10:00,725,"Thanks Mike, perhaps I have become a little too possessive of Wine Lake. i will back off and wave heartily at red boats because it might be one of my Walleye Central buddies. The Wine Lake system has plenty of fish and perhaps i should learn to share. interesting about the narrows, i always slow down when the Wabby anglers are packed in there so I don't rock the boats. That's how I roll. In fact that is probably the thing that ticks me off most- people zooming their boats closely by me. Crap, I should just be thankful the Lord has blessed me enough that i can do two Ontario trips a year. in fact if any of you wabby daytrippers see me (if you can make out my picture on the avatar) mention Walleye Central and i will put you on a hot spot!"
1398862,Big Mike,2012-02-24 22:31:00,35,"Hey I completely understand wanting to have the peacefulness and tranquility that is the Wine Lake experience kept the way it is!!! Hopefully some of the guys who have gotten too close and maybe even kept the wrong size fish down there will not return or maybe read this post and understand that fishermen deserve their space. I cant tell you the number of times Ive had guys drive right up to me, pop an icon on their gps, and then put the throttle down and take off. I dont know why they didnt just start fishing along with me because I know they are going to head there as soon as I leave anyway??? When I read a post like this it even makes me think of some of the things I could have done differently while out there. Good luck on your trips and I will make sure I give you a big wave again as you cruise by to the west towards paradise! PS...your groups always slow down through the narrows for boats, thats never been a problem for us..."
1422688,Illinois AG,2012-04-18 08:20:00,6,"Wish I had more time to write - but my friends and I are on our third trip to Wabaskang. Absolutely Love the lake. if you like catching massive amounts of Walleye and Northern, I have never quite been to a place like this. We go to Tall Pines Camp. I would encourage you going to their site. These people are awesome. Cabins are great, location is premium and they provide the best boats on the lake. Love potluck Wednesday (they make something exotic like Moose Loaf and everyone in camp comes down with a dish and a few cold ones to talk the night away. Best of Luck!"
1424253,trapper_john,2012-04-21 14:48:00,83,This year will be our eighth trip to Kingfisher. the owners now are super nice and it's a very clean and comfortable camp. They will do everything in their power to put you on fish. I'm sure that there are other nice camps on Wabbie but we've never felt the need to change it up.
1424318,drlee,2012-04-21 17:31:00,409,"I have fished both Thaddeus and Route Lake. Thaddeus itself is not a large lake; it has a good population of walleye, usually most easily fished along weed lines. You can get to two other really nice lakes from Thaddeus by boat, but it is a tough trip, IMO. You have to go through a creek that passes through a culvert. With the creek current...ok, but against it, not so much. They provide a rope to grab onto and pull you through. My boat is just too large to make that trip, and I'm no spring chicken anymore! Thaddeus cabins are really nice...clean and well appointed. You will never meet nicer, more helpful camp owners anywhere. No other camps on the system, but a few private cabins. If not for the difficult passage to the other two lakes, I would be returning to Thaddeus every summer from here on out. Route Lake is a boat in camp located on a peninsula only a few minutes from the boat landing. The cabins are nice; the peninsula is gorgeous, with wooden walkways installed around the cabins, the lodge, and the dock area. The owners were very nice to us; the lodge will serve meals either as part of the package or by request with a reservation whenever you feel the urge. I ate in the lodge a couple of times and was NOT disappointed! (we just prefer to cook and eat our own walleye most of the time) The lake is one of the prettiest in all of Ontario. However, it is not easy to fish. It is very deep (has a good population of lake trout and gets a lot of business early in the season). Finding fishable water for walleyes can be a challenge, but when you get to them, the quality and size are pretty darn impressive. It is NOT a 100 fish per day experience. I have stayed at Wabaskang at Sleepy Dog and the cabins are the nicest I have seen on any of the 20 or more lakes I have fished over the years in Ontario. The owners are absolutely great! The lake is not really tough to fish and has plenty of beautiful scenery. You can get around on it without worry, as you can with the two lakes I commented on above. I will admit that we struggled to get walleyes on the one and only time I fished the lake, but from what I have read over time on this message board, that was an unusual experience, probably magnified by the fact that it was a new lake to me. From your description of what you want and what I have read on WC, I would say Wabaskang is your best bet and that my choice would be Sleepy Dog...but I have heard nothing negative about the other camps on the lake. Just a note of caution: There are a lot of camps on Wabaskang...hence, lots of fishermen (no, we did not have any bad experiences). BTW: I now fish two lakes in the Ignace area for a total of a month each summer and will continue to do so until I am pushing up daisies!"
1393493,tadler,2012-02-12 20:14:00,43,"If you want to stay on Wabaskang, I strongly recommend Sleepy Dog Camp. Your wife will absolutely love the cabins and Tom is a good host. http://www.sleepydogcabins.com/"
1393813,KevinSB,2012-02-13 14:08:00,73,I agree with Jay. We stay at Tall Pines but cover virtually the entire lake during our week. Don't feel compelled to pick a particular camp based on location unless you're certain you know exactly where you want to fish most of the time and unless you mind boat rides! I think you won't go wrong anywhere on Wabaskang.
1394495,WallerChief,2012-02-14 19:26:00,83,"You really need to give Sleepy Dog a call if you're going to Wabaskang. Tom runs an excellent camp; we've stayed there for the past three years and as long as I'm going to Wabby, you'll find me at Sleepy Dog Cabins."
1394507,Glenman12,2012-02-14 19:51:00,762,"if you end up going to Wabaskang you need to do a day trip to Wine Lake...that was fun with the portage, rapids etc.."
1394876,ksand774,2012-02-15 17:42:00,51,Has anyone fished Wabaskang in July? Do the lakes this far up have mayfly hatches? Is it worth while to bring crawlers? I haved talked to several of the lodges up there and I am going to hit the All Canada show in Minneapolis this weekend and pick a Lodge. Also wondering if anyone has fished out of Route Lake Lodge it looks very interesting. Thanks for all the great input.
1395000,cough6609,2012-02-15 21:50:00,48,"I've fished both Wabby and Gull Rock in July and August. Early July can be very unpredictable, but extremely productive if you hit it right. Early/late ice-outs, rain/water levels and clarity have a huge impact. Early July can be really complicated due to where the weed edge has moved to(8-15ft) and the timing of the Mayfly hatch. Late July and early August is much more stable. You know you'll be fishing weed edge from 15-18ft. of water and deep water humps of 20-25ft for the eyes and cabbage adjacient to deep water for Pike. I'd skip the $50.00 crawler pack and invest that money in leeches or minnows. Listen, you're on vacation. You know if you go to Wrigley Field or Disney World you're going to pay $5.00 for a hotdog and $7.00 for a beer. Pony up the $3-4.00 per dozen for minnows and you'll be much happier every day when you're in the cleaning house."
1395050,ksand774,2012-02-16 05:53:00,51,Do you think I would be better off going the week of July 21 to avoid the mayfly hatch? My vacation time is not fixed I am just looking for a chance of good weather.
1395099,UKBDM,2012-02-16 08:02:00,178,"We have been on Wabaskang the last week of June for the past two years. Mayfly hatch was not an issue in 2010 and was just beginning as we left in 2011. Fishing was good, not great, on both trips but I would say that is because we are just learning the lake and walleye fishing in general.There are two or three guys on here that have helped me tremendously with Wabaskang. Hopefully they will weigh in shortly ..."
1395114,HeHooksHimself,2012-02-16 08:37:00,725,"As a Wine Lake Camp regular, we get a little perturbed with the ""day trippers"" from Wabby. We pay a premium to fish the Wine Lake system and while we realize we do not own the lake, we find ""day trippers"" (not all of course, but some) can be a little aggressive and push their way into our hot spots even when we are anchored. Some are loud and they always come in groups to spoil the solitude we enjoy at WLC. While I do not speak for Herb and Ann, I know they go to great lengths to insure that the limits and slots are enforced to make the WLC fishery what it is, which is awesome. I might suggest that if you do make the day trip, please respect those of us who intentionally stay at WLC and just use Wabby as a way to get to our own paradise. Maybe its our sense of entitlement (we are Americans!) but we are never too happy to see ""red boats"" in our waters. If I wanted to fish in a less remote and more congested system, I would book with a Wabby resort. I realize this may be a little controversial but I still love all who fish Ontario!"
1395180,UKBDM,2012-02-16 10:38:00,178,"I would say that what you really don't like is rude, obnoxious fishermen that don't respect other fisherman. I don't like them either but I suspect the % of this type of fishermen is no greater among Wine Lake daytrippers from Wabaskang than it is among any group of fisherman.Are the limits and slots different on Wine Lake? How do Herb and Ann enforce them? I thought that was the job of the MNR?I'm not trying to stir the pot but ... your statements are a bit more than controversial."
1391144,ksand774,2012-02-07 18:47:00,51,Looking for input on Wabaskang Lake or Canyon Lake or good drive in lake for variety of fishing. Trying to keep price down to $500 - $700 per person. Loooking for cabin/boat package. Thanks
1391346,Magician Fishin,2012-02-08 11:48:00,2,Sleepy Dog-Wabaskang is a good option.
1391559,Guest,2012-02-08 19:08:00,0,"Try the Ignace area if you are looking for a bargain with great fishing. Rouseau's Landing would be a good start. Some deals to be had in the Silver Dollar area as well (north of Ignace on Highway 599). Pretty much the same drive as Wabaskang but far less fishing pressure. The operations in this area tend to have fewer amenities but if you are more interested in fishing than the appearance of your cabin, you can't go wrong."
1391649,ndfan79,2012-02-09 05:25:00,1,"I firmly believe that heaven on earth does exsist, and it is at Peffleys Camp on Wabaskang Lake. Last year my friend and I decided to take a fishing trip to Canada, and of all the places there we chose Peffley's. I would highly recommend his camp to anyone. The customer service provided by Dave and his staff is beyond reproach. The cabin we stayed in was very roomy, clean, and the beds comfortable. Dave did an excellent job of putting a couple ""first timers"" on fish right away. The natural beauty of this place is amazing! Your concern of ""price"" is taken care of also. Very affordable trip, and would be in your range. If you need anymore info feel free to message me. A+++ rating to his camp and the fishing."
1392437,robby1952,2012-02-10 13:23:00,5,I agree with the assesment of Peffley's. Went there for the first time last year as well. A+++ service. Beautiful area and plenty of fish. Going back this year.
1392499,ripnlipstaknnames,2012-02-10 15:02:00,27,"i have never fished wabaskang but have been to canyon 4 or 5 times. i have fished out of about 8 or so canadian lodges over the years and canyon was unique. if you want to catch huge numbers of fish, canyon is not your place, but if you want to fish for muskies it is awsesome. the walleye fishing is good, you wont catch a hundred or more a day like you can at other places in canada but the average size here has been great. lots of low to mid 20 inch range fish and we have taken several over 30. some days it is difficult to catch some good eater fish in the 15-17 inch range because they are all too big. that being said if you work hard for walleye all day you can still catch plenty of fish. the lake does have some very nice bass as well but not in enough numbers to spend to much time targeting them. just my opinion on the lake from my experiences there.ps-we always stayed at blyths canyon lake lodge, decent cabins and very affordable, i think it was just over 500 per guy the last time we were there which was about 5 or 6 years ago"
1392542,JAY221,2012-02-10 16:12:00,877,"We have stayed at Kingfishers on Wabaskang twice over the years & the current owners have taken very good care of us. I personally really like the lake as it is semi broken up & you can always find someplace out of the wind if need be. The fishing has always been good enough for us. The wife liked it because you can always run to Ear falls if you want to to break up the week for a meal or whatever. I have not stayed at Peffleys but have talked to Dave & if you want to be more remote Dave can & will take care of you. Later, Jay"
1393184,ksand774,2012-02-12 08:12:00,51,Thanks for the input from everyone that has posted a reply.I checked Peffleys camp they did not have a opening with a 3 piece bathroom which is one thing my Wife always wants in a cabin.How does the fishing differ at Kingfisher or tall pines they both seemto be on the same area of the lake? I also found a couple of other Campsthat looked interesting Thaddeus Lake Camp and Route lake camp.Has anyone fished out of this? I am interested in some of the big lakes butthink it might be too much for my Wife. Thanks again.
1393212,JAY221,2012-02-12 08:56:00,877,"The lake is not that big. You can be fishing the same water from any camp in a half an hours time. You don't have to go that far to find fish in my opinion. Later, Jay"
1393343,eyemike,2012-02-12 14:12:00,233,You might try Jim and Julie's Wabaskang Camp. I know a group that goes there every year and have nothing but good things to say about their stay there.
