1422814,bergsh,2012-04-18 11:56:00,183,"I brought my 3 month old fishing last year. He didn't fish yet, but I already got him a few poles for the time he is ready. Granted we only took him in the boat for a few hours on 2 days, but one thing is for sure. The hum of a motor puts the kiddos right to sleep. This year he is going with us again. Will be 16 months old. Lots of toys this year."
1422826,Obabikon,2012-04-18 12:13:00,2370,"haha... Berg, we did the same thing. Middle section of the boat was emptied and blocked off. Filled with a play mat and toys."
1422974,Burr,2012-04-18 16:07:00,8612,"I have no kids, but this question reminds me of a friends answer. When he was younger, with a young family, he and his wife worked different shifts, and things were tight.So, he could take the kids fishing, and afford to buy bait, or drop the kids off a the sitter, and not afford bait. He always had bait, and he learned he could change diapers in the boat just as easily as anywhere else.His kids somehow all seem to be comfortable in the boat all through their teenage years, and now as adults. It didn't matter if they were fishing or not. It's just time in the boat, with Dad, and fishing is one available option. His girls are all good fisher-people - but they have different preferences, and their Dad allows his kids to make some fishing decisions. One likes to run and gun, and one likes to target fish. So, diapers are OK to change in the boat."
1423031,Blue Lk,2012-04-18 18:51:00,269,"Take your children whenever you can,hopefully they will remember & take you later in life.I have fished with my boys for 30+ years & hope to fish together for many more."

1422006,Tonyo,2012-04-16 20:52:00,212,A quick reply for everyone. I have a 12 year old son who will be making his fourth trip this year. He just told me he had a dream last night of landing a giant pike. He loves to go and has never once been bored or complained after sitting in the boat for 12 hours. He still brings his gameboy but only plays it once we are back for the night and he is tired. Otherwise he is one of the guys and sits and listens to all of us tell stories and laughs along with the rest of us. I wouldn't make the trip without him. He is a great fishing partner and it is a solid 10 days of father/son time we cherish year round. TonyO
1422024,njkrejca,2012-04-16 21:12:00,3,"As Bill Krejca (My Dad) posted, I've been going to Canada with him for 30 years now (since I was 8). To this day, I would rather go ""Up North"" fishing than any where else in the world. I was fortunate to have a father who wanted me to share in his passion and took the ""leap of faith"" that I too would fall in love with it....he was right, I did. The memories made in the past, are what gets us through the year till we can go again. Dad's right, life time of memories made in a week! I promised my daughter when she was 8 I would take her to Canada just like my Dad did. Making good on my promise, August 2011 was the date for her (and my wife's) first Canadian trip, 3 weeks after Dad and I were up there. We stayed at O'Sullivan's Rainbow Lodge in Nakina, ON (same place Dad and I go). Thank God for the iPilot's anchor option because I spent many hours taking Walleyes off the hook for my wife and daughter. They both had a blast! My daughter caught the largest Walleye at 25 1/2"".....priceless picture, then released. She had a fishing attention span of about 2 hours then migrated to coloring books, etc. We did many shore lunches on sand beaches where she could swim and release some energy, then it was back to fishing. My daughter learned a lot from this trip about nature, conservation (CPR), and how to have fun without TV/etc. The camp owner took my daughter and I bear baiting with him...what a great experience for an 8 year old (and a 38 year old). O'Sullivan's Rainbow is a great resort with great owners who want everyone to enjoy their stay and guarantee it. By the end of the week, we booked the cabin for 2012 and will be going back up in August again. Both my Wife and Daughter are ""Hooked"". The really good news here, is I get to go to Canada twice a year! Although it is a little (OK a lot) more work taking your kid, the memories made in that week will last a lifetime. Attached is a picture of her with her walleye...the smile says it all! Nate Krejca"
1422031,eyemike,2012-04-16 21:26:00,233,I started taking my daughter north when she was 9. I could not get her out of the boat so that we could eat supper! I used to get my but chewed by the owners wife when we did come in for the night. She wouldn't believe me about Crystal not wanting to come in. She fished hard and is as good as anyone I know catching walleyes. She will pull a pike from the water by hand to release the hook. She is 28 now and still talks about her Canadian trips.I just hope to get another trip with her some day.
1422036,Nimstug,2012-04-16 21:49:00,2605,"Scott, I know and agree with what you say, but it may never be too late. I had serious problems with my son during his teens. He was the one who got me fishing when he was 10 or so but quickly went off in another direction despite our efforts. Believe me, we did everything. When is was 17 we told him he had to do x, y, and z, within the next two weeks or we would throw him out of the house and change the locks. He didn't and and we did. Three years later, I asked him if he would come with me on my first trip to Canada. We started rebuilding the chain, slowly link by link. Since then we've fished Ontario a number of times and the Boundary Water. September will be our 7th trip together. Never stop trying, never stop asking. NImstug"
1422038,P. Norts,2012-04-16 21:59:00,396,"I loved reading these posts and hearing all the first trip stories. Our first trip to Rainy with our kids they were 6, 9 and 10. The youngest a girl, she didn't care much for fishing. However as someone else mentioned she had all the minnows and worms named. She also would have what she called"" fashion shows"" with all the glittery, brightly colored plastics. She would have them walking the runway on the dashboard.She would also use the Marine radio mic (radio off of course) to auction off exerything in the boat and give play by play of each catch. She was also a reader, beyond her age, so she never really complained . My husband took the boys out with a guide early in the week so they learned there were fish in the lake and they indeed could be caught. Now, 15 years later we all still look forward to our annual trip. July 8th can't get her soon enough. Mama Norts"
1422158,cast_and_blast,2012-04-17 07:49:00,1098,"Couldn't agree more - hopefully never too late. Today's world kids have so much more to demand their time...sports (often year round), computers, video games, etc. Good luck - Scott"
1422448,Jiggin_Rob,2012-04-17 17:50:00,26,"The first time I brought my son to canada, he was 9 and we did a fly in trip. when we were loading on to the plane the pilot asked who would like the front seat and my son begged and pleaded for him to be the lucky one we smiled and said yes. Well the look of total joy on his face while we were flying around up there is one that I will never forget. The pilot was nice and did a turnaround when some moose were spotted laying in a river mouth.. What a awesome sight for us to see. he took to the fishing well and never once complained about the long hours in the boat..He caught arround 15 walleye that week and has the fishing addiction in his blood."
1422452,Jiggin_Rob,2012-04-17 17:56:00,26,oops hit enter prematuraly....... My son has often told me that that trip strongly influenced him on his future endeavors.... He is now an airline pilot working for air-tran..... Who would guess!
1422506,pawalleye32,2012-04-17 19:49:00,18,"Great Post.I took my 6 year old on his first trip last summer. We decided to go for a short 3 day trip for his first adventure. He would have stayed longer. This year, we'll extend the length of the trip. We went in July - fishing isn't as good, but we spent the afternoons swimming and cruising around. His best memory is staying in the cabin, eating popcorn, drinking root beer, and learning to play poker from his Pop-pop. Priceless memory.Enjoy."
1422530,rnnonmt,2012-04-17 20:35:00,992,Nice story and NICE FISH!

Attached is a couple of pics of my youngest with his first canadian walleye and last years Northern and Bass. Enjoy the memories you are about to make. Have a great year.Ben's First Walleye.pdfThank you,Larry Mac"
1421652,Steve Ediger,2012-04-16 11:05:00,97,"The first time I took my son (and Me) to Canada he was 4. He will be 19 this year and we are planning trips #23 & #24. He loves it almost as much as I enjoy him being there. Regardless the age I think you will find it worthwhile! He and I have a saying ""you never know what you are going to see in Canada"" and it's true."
1421665,UKBDM,2012-04-16 11:35:00,178,"Took my son to Wabaskang for the first time two years ago at age 11. The 20 hour drive was tougher on him than the all day fishing. He is so ate up with fishing that I can't convince him that waterfowl hunting is just as fun. Taking the 11 year old daughter for first time this year. Pretty sure she will be different than her brother. Probably sleep in every morning but be ready to fish the afternoon/evening bite. I am ok with that. I know she will love the north country and enjoy spending time with dear old dad.Every kid (and their personality) is different. We will have 6-7 kids in camp and we tend to split them up in different boats every day. If 1-2 of them have no patience, someone will go put them on some perch with slipbobbers and UL gear. We have also found that brothers that don't get along at home tend to be best buds in fishing camp. Funny how that works."
1421673,skindzier,2012-04-16 11:53:00,137,"Been taking my daughter since she was 11. We've always spent most of the day fishing, however, we always take a long lunch break at a beach, so she could run around, play in the sand, etc. While on the boat, if she got bored she woul play Ferry Boat Captain, or some such thing - just play along! One other thing she used to love was ""cleaning"" the windshield with a rope. Simple joys."
1421750,Mike Borger,2012-04-16 14:49:00,1554,"We've brought our two kids north to my camp in QC since they were born, so they've been exposed to this type of thing since day one.However last summer my 4 year old son and 7 year old daughter joined me on a couple of major fishing trips, a first for each of them.Both were fine on the trips and had a blast. My son loves fishing moreso than my daughter, he's really got the bug badly!Here's a couple of video clips from last years trips:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nzk0I...8&feature=plcphttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NG0t...feature=relmfuhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmdbS...feature=relmfuhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49lmM2VbyV8 Bottom line it's never too young to bring them!"
1421789,Lovetofish,2012-04-16 16:07:00,458,I read through this again and it brought back a memory to the original question. This subject came up with an older guy in our camp one year. I asked him what age did he bring his kids. A very strick reply of age 12.....anything younger and kids aren't ready. Fast forward a couple years and we came home from our annual trip. Grandpa and grandma had watched our kids that week and he told me sometime later when we left for camp that trip my son ran after our van and grandpa had to go after him. Said he wanted to go along and was crying. It broke my heart when I heard this and he and his sister made the next trip at age 8 & 6. I couldn't have asked them to behave bette so take your kids fishing.
1421873,rnnonmt,2012-04-16 18:01:00,992,"CanadaDave... Also take a look at the the thread ""getting spooled up"" in the Canada Eh forums. It is a very similar thread topic.Brian"
1421877,Larry Mac,2012-04-16 18:06:00,530,"Hi Lovetofish, great post and thank you for sharing.Thank you,Larry Mac"
1421881,Pikeslayer8,2012-04-16 18:11:00,1460,"I was 9 when I went on my first trip. Both of my boys were 9 on their first trips. We allow no games or distractions. My oldest son Brett is an Eagle scout thanks in large part to having the Canadian experience. He turns 21 tomorrow. I only had to show him how to tie his own knot once. He only complained when he thought that he wasn't catching enough fish. Son Bradley is now 17 and was a lot more low key when he first went. Oftentimes he would just sit in the boat and sing his little heart out. His anger level at the fish was much lower but always loved to be out in the boat and never ever complained about anything. Now there are 2 different types of boat captains in our group. First, there is the conservative type that likes to go where its close to camp and just sit on top of walleyes and work a school till they all have hook mouth. Then ya got the guys like me and my brother who are, lets say more adventurous. If I can't fish on the opposite side of the lake and check all the good bays and spots where a pike might lurk, well, I'm just not happy. The boys just love this and are always in for a good adventure. So yeah, like Wallydave said ""sharing our passion with our children, the bonding and the experience can only trully be known by simply bringing them North and sharing real quality time, in the boat, and around the camp. You will know when the time is right!"" You just have to have faith in your children to know when the time is right. Don't under estimate them. They will surprise you!"
1421907,Weby13,2012-04-16 18:46:00,57,"I took my 6 year old son last year on his first Canadian trip along with my father a friend and his two sons 10 and 14. We did a fly in. Just the plane trip alone was an awesome experience for the kids! If fishing got a little slow we would go swimming or go look for animals. It was a great time sitting at the campfire at night enjoying each others company, roasting marshmellows and telling the kids stories of previous fishing trips we were on. Were heading to Eddies North this August and we cant wait!!!!!"
1421543,Guest,2012-04-16 08:00:00,0,"At what age do you start bringing your kids on the trip up north, when can they stand being in the boat all day fising and not get bored?"
1421548,wallydave,2012-04-16 08:10:00,2151,"Dave, when to bring your kids really depends on how much they like the outdoors. If they like to spend their time ""not being plugged in"" that is a good sign they would like a trip North! Perhaps the first trip might be a local lake or pond for fishing, if that works a Canada trip will be in your future. Most of us here have shared our passion with our children, the bonding and the experiance can only trully be known by simply bringing them North and sharing real quality time, in the boat, and around the camp. You will know when the time is right!"
1421550,rnnonmt,2012-04-16 08:11:00,992,I took my older son when he reached 9. Bring along lots of snacks on the boat if he gets bored. It only lasts (the boredom) for a few minutes.
1421559,LOW1,2012-04-16 08:19:00,2828,"I agree with WallyDave. And our view and practice was to begin taking them well before they were content to fish all day. Our youngest was barely walking on his first trip. And don't think that you have to fish all day. Swimming, kayaking, fishing off the dock so they are not trapped in a boat, hiking and even going in to town for a movie or an indoor swimming pool are all options depending on where you go. You can follow your childs' lead. The important thing is to have fun. Everything else will work out."
1421575,stumcfar,2012-04-16 08:41:00,451,"I had told my son when he turned 10 he could start going. Last year was his first year. Probably should have started taking him a year or two earlier. He would fish all day, with a little stretch time during shore lunch and when we came in, he would spend another hour or two fishing on the docks. Good memories, get them started and they will talk about it until the next trip."
1421583,Lovetofish,2012-04-16 08:58:00,458,"Our son was 8 and daughter 6. This summer will be 13 years straight for them and 20 for my wife and I. In the early years with the kids I remember gameboys, I-pods, plenty of snacks and a few naps in the boat. Each year the kids would fish a littler harder. We try to hit the water around 9 and usually back to camp around 4. Stop on a beach for lunch around noon. The only thing I wish is I had those years back. And I wouldn't change a thing. We have a unique fishing group of families and I think what has made it work so well was having other kids in camp. A couple mornings I fish by myself and let my family sleep in. And I fish a couple evenings as well. I've made several fall trips without my family. Still fun, but not the same. So, take your kids fishing. I don't think they will ever forget it."
1421598,Knutson21,2012-04-16 09:28:00,348,"I have been going to Canada every year since I was (7), I am now 34. I wouldn't trade the experience with my family for anything. That is not completely true. My family took me the first time when I was 18 Months, however I don't remember that trip. But I do remeber every other one. If you don't start kids early they won't be interested, I had my daughter at the age of 2 catching crappies at a local lake last year, she just turned 3 last week and has been telling me that she can't wait to go with me and her grandpa this summer. If you wait to long to get them introduced they will rather play video games. I also hope to get her into shotgun sports as early as possible too. I will be honest I don't care if she ever gets into hunting but it would be cool if she likes to shoot sporting clays with her dad and grandpa."
1421609,cast_and_blast,2012-04-16 09:57:00,1098,"If you wait that long you will have lost them already. My three boys have all gone fishing with me (local and up north on family vacations) since they were very little. Far too little to consider being in the boat all day. But, we brought hot wheels, books and snacks in the boat. We had plastic/rubber fish tied onto the end of their line to practice casting (without hooking anyone), we catch/count/name the minnows in the baitwell, we play with the fish in the livewell. I make sure they reel in my fish, I help them with the net on other fish. They listen to music in the boat. Then we have a picnic, stop on an island and go for a hike, hook up the tube or kneeboard and play on that. Or, we're back at camp having some relaxation - campfire, fish off the dock, play on the beach. If it's all fish-fish-fish, they will grow to hate it. My oldest likes it but often brings a book along, my 2nd oldest LOVES it and will fish all day, my youngest will not allow the boat to leave the dock unless he's in it. Good luck, these are your fishing buddies for life! Scott"
1421617,Knoxabilly,2012-04-16 10:05:00,225,"I started going when I was 12, haven't missed a year since. The trip has evolved from my Dad, Uncle and Brother to Me and anyone I can get to go. I cherish the family years I spent there! When I have kids I'll definitely start them young up there. Best memories happen in Canada!"
1421634,Bill Krejca,2012-04-16 10:25:00,6107,"I started my Canadian visits when I was 11 months old, but really didn't develop my casting until several years later! I took my boy when he was 8 years old, camping on an island for a week with my dad, and a bunch of other guys. My boy didn't always fish, sometimes when it rained he just hunkered down, covered up in the front of the boat, and slept. My dad mounted his grandson's first Canadian fish from that trip - brings back a bunch of memories. When we go today, my son, who is now 38, drives the truck, and usually the boat. Don't wait too long, guys, to begin building memories! Bill Krejca"
