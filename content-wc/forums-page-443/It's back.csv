Monday was an ice storm and snow, melted a bit on tuesday and back to heavy snow today. It sure looks like winter, (maybe christmas is around the corner).Hard to believe was out on the boat this past weekend fishing walleyes before they closed til May, I wonder if this is the last of old man winter?Sure got spoiled with the hot weather in mid march.Fisherman 1792"
