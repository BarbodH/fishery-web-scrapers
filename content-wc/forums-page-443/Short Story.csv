I know this is not the forum to air my laundry, thats why I put down my e-mail address. In short, John & I are divorced and I'm looking to move out of state. My job background is metal stamping, welding, fabrication. Account Management. I'd like to be in Iowa, Indiana, Kentucky where I can afford to live. Wisconsin is a nightmare and a political **** hole. Just wanted to network. Again, all of you are awesome!!!"
