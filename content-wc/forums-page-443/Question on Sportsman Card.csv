1422806,bergsh,2012-04-18 11:42:00,183,You will need an Outdoors card. You can get that when you get your liscense. You will get a paper copy saying you bought it and then it will be mailed to you later. Passport or Passport Card obviously too.
1422874,elway12,2012-04-18 13:32:00,335,The outdoors (sportsman) card is only required in order to purchase a fishing license. The card has nothing to do with entering Canada. All you need to enter Canada is a passport.
