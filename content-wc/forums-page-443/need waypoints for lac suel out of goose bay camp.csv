1418287,wallydave,2012-04-09 06:47:00,2151,Hey Wolf! One of the first things Andrea will do for your group is to sit down with you and map out the spots that have been working lately. I have a couple different maps from past trips. She will do her best to put you on the fish! Have a great trip!
1418372,NathanH,2012-04-09 09:16:00,697,Wallyedave is right. Its been a long time since I was at the Goosebay camp 15 years. Remember catching nice northerns right of the dock. Anyway the first thing they do is sit you down ask you about what you want to fish for and start marking the map with a bunch of great starting places. Then you can branch out from there. I remember catching a lot of fish and having a great time. It was my first trip to Canada and I was 15 perhaps thats why I can remember the details of that trip like it was yesterday.
