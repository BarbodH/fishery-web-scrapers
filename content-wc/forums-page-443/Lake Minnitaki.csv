1423051,Ranger319,2012-04-18 19:22:00,166,You are a @ss! Gotta rub it in on how you fished out of your boat. blah blah blah. Ok maybe my EXTREME jealousy has made me bitter. Don't leave us all hanging....how'd ya do?!? 59 more days!!!
1423055,pickeralarm,2012-04-18 19:28:00,16,"Awesome, caught all 17"" males, water temp 44 degrees, females are close to spawning. Red Pine was hot. sorry for rubbing it in, but now we all have to wait til our May long weekend. But don't worry I'll be back out for trout on Minnitaki soon"
1423134,TroyMansfield,2012-04-18 21:36:00,92,"I ripped through the chutes the other day with our twin engine landing craft with a 5000lb load at 40mph, the fishing was pretty good there the last few weeks before the season closed, we slammed them on the sturgeon river where it flows into Abram Lake, everything from 15'' to 28'' walleyes were caught, we also fished the bottom side of chutes and got into them pretty good there also. Today we got we 3 inches of real wet snow, which will help with the uprising, water temp maxed out to 48 degrees, but that didnt last long enough, water temps cooled back down and the walleyes havnt started to spawn yet. Now all we need is some nice weather again to get out and do some trout slammin on minnitaki"
1423135,TroyMansfield,2012-04-18 21:41:00,92,"heres the boat I was referring too, not the same load though, the load in the pic is close to 10,000lbs when filled"
1423347,IaDave,2012-04-19 11:31:00,476,That boat is great- I've seen it loaded up with 8 guys sitting on a picnic table when Dick was taking them on a guided trip to Minnitaki. He put the hammer down leaving the island and was gone in a second. Troy-how fast will that go with nothing on it?
1423400,tv4fish,2012-04-19 13:19:00,2694,"Kind of surprised to hear that. Sooo - Is Lac Seul also back to ""normal"" ?"
1423529,TroyMansfield,2012-04-19 17:49:00,92,"the boat will run about 63-65mph at the rev limiter, with 21pitch five blades, could use a pair of 23s for empty and light running, I was pushing docks in today and the water is only down about 2ft from the high water mark, and we are guessing it to come up another foot by opener, as for Lac Seul, I havnt been out there in a week or so but Im sure its down quite a bit still, but itll be on the rise"
1423746,Mohleye,2012-04-20 08:30:00,368,"Sorry to belabor this, but have you had enough precipitation this spring to bring the water levels up this much, or is this due to something going on with the hydro at Ear Falls?"
1424054,TroyMansfield,2012-04-20 21:32:00,92,"we have had enough run off and rain, and a mix of snow that has added up substanially for the MInnitaki,Abram,Pelican,Botsford lakes, these group of lakes are not controlled by the **** at Ear Falls, there flow is natural into Lac Seul, the water is only about 20''-24'' down from the high water mark on MAPB waters, Lac Seul is still low"
1344860,skap,2011-08-29 09:18:00,58,Good morning!Heading out on Wednesday for a quick 4 days on Minnitaki. Just curious if anyone has been there recently and how they did.Have a great Labor Day everyone!
1344889,Shotgun,2011-08-29 10:12:00,759,"Returned on August 13th after seven days on Minnitaki. Third straight year fishing this lake. Water levels are down two to three feet. Many more rocks and mounds are showing up, which means more boating hazards/concerns. Fishing was less productive than the past two years and not what I'd rate as great fishing. Most productive areas appeared to be floating across deep humps in main part of the lake. Normally Red Pine Bay is good but it did not produce any numbers either. However, it was where we caught the biggest walleyes. Will not return until water level is somewhat normal. Just spend some extra time watching for trip ending boat repairs. Good luck and be safe."
1344898,skap,2011-08-29 10:31:00,58,"Thanks Shotgun for the update. I am slightly worried about the low water level. You take away a couple of feet of water and you are that much closer to rocks you have not seen before. We will be careful as always.We were there in the spring and to be honest, it was a little slower than normal at that time as well. The fish are there, just not as active as I had seen them in the past. The fact of the matter is you get a little spoiled up there and when you have the good days, they are REALLY good.Thanks again!"
1344908,tv4fish,2011-08-29 10:56:00,2694,"Skap: Just returned yesterday from a short 5 day trip. Water level is definitely down, but we still made it up Abram's chutes w/o any problems - just hug the west shore line and you should be fine. As was said ^^^^^, our best luck was on reefs ""out in the middle"" of the lake system. Action was nothing like my trip in latter part of June. We found most of our fish in the Minnitaki system in the 26-30 foot depth. We also ventured up into Lac Seul - similar pattern up there, as far as depth/locations. Found a close-in spot in Deception Bay that produced the best for the trip. Just a small ""hump"" in the middle. Couldn't have been bigger than 50'x100' -- but the fish were there. Weather was beautiful."
1344909,Shotgun,2011-08-29 10:57:00,759,"Again, just be careful. Whoever is in the boat with you needs to be helping you watch for rocks. I fish a Lund 1700 Fisherman (first year haviing it there) and it sets deeper in the water than my previous boats. I ran right up on a rock mound going through a channel that in past years I had no problems zipping right through. Fortunately, I was not going fast and backed right off it. The camp we stay at has a channel to travel to get to the lake. I had to troll through the channel as the first trip I sucked up mud in my motor and had to remove my water lines to clean them out. We also fish out of an Alumacraft 1850 Trohpy and we had the same issues going through the channel with it, just too shallow. Seemed liked my 5 foot shallow alarm was going of constantly. Just doesn't make for a fun trip. And your correct on the fishing this lake. First year I fished this lake it was great but past two years have been very slow with this year being the slowest. For me it's enjoying the entire journey not just catching fish. Be safe and enjoy!"
1348202,fire105,2011-09-09 12:10:00,40,"just returned last night from taki, abrahms and pelican, water levels are way down , the first leafs on docks are setting on the ground. rock piles are every were. i hear a plane crashed right by the abrahms shoots last week or a couple weeks ago.the plane hit a reef that is normally submerged. running the shoots is very hair raising put a lot of people are running then. The guides were i stayed at are trailering around the shoots. Fishing was slower that i'm use to! fish are staging at 20-30'. weed beds were hard to find but we traveled alot to find them. I feel sorry for all the resort owners who are loosing customers due to low water.People just don't want to risk the low water levels and the minimal fishing."
1422321,Guest,2012-04-17 12:30:00,0,Has anyone heard the water level of Lake Minnitaki this spring . Thanks
1422636,Cash,2012-04-18 07:05:00,73,ttt
1422686,IaDave,2012-04-18 08:18:00,476,I talked to an operater at the NW Sport Show and it is still low. Hope for rain I guess.
1423039,pickeralarm,2012-04-18 19:09:00,16,I fished it last saturday out of the boat. Lake level has come back to normal and still rising. All is good. The chutes will be fine.
