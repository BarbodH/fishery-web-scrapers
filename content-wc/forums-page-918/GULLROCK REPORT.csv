523470,VANT,2002-08-12 19:03:00,68,"JUST GOT BACK. WE WERE THERE 8/2 THROUGH 8/9. FISHING WAS PRETTY SLOW FIRST DAY. THINK A COLD FRONT JUST WENT THROUGH. THINGS GOT BETTER THE SECOND DAY AND FROM MONDAY ON IT WAS GREAT. FILLED OUR LIMIT WITH NICE FAT 17.5"" AND 18"" FISH. QUIT KEEPING TRACK OF ALL THE 20"" AND BIGGER WALLEYE WE WERE CATCHING. WE HAD 3 25"" FISH AND LOTS IN THE 22 & 23"" RANGE. SOMEONE AT CAMP CAUGHT A 28.5"" WALLEYE WHILE FISHING A SUICK FOR NORTHERN. FISH WERE MOSTLY CAUGHT DEEPER THAN WE NORMALLY FISH AT THIS TIME OF YEAR. WE NORMALLY FISH 18 TO 20 FEET OF WATER. THIS YEAR WE WERE FISHING 25 TO 35 FEET. CAUGHT MOST OF THE BIGGER ONES ON LEECHES, ALTHOUGH I GOT SOME REAL NICE ONES ON CRAWLERS ON A SIMPLE 2 HOOK HARNESS, NO SPINNER. I WAS THE ONLY ONE FISHING CRAWLERS, ALTHOUGH I FISHED LEECHES EARLIER IN THE WEEK. JUST TRIED CRAWLERS FOR A CHANGE OF PACE. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF DIE HARD MINNOW FISHERMAN IN OUR GROUP THAT WOULDN'T FISH A LEECH OR A CRAWLER FOR ANYTHING. THEY WERE CATCHING FISH, BUT NOT THE SIZE WE WERE GETTING WITH THE LEECHES & CRAWLERS. IT SEEMS FUNNY THAT FOR ALL THE 22 TO 25"" FISH WE WERE CATCHING THAT WE DIDN'T GET ANYTHING BIGGER. I DON'T KNOW IF THEY HAVE ALL BEEN TAKEN OUT OR IF WE JUST WEREN'T FINDING THEM. ANY IDEAS? NOT THAT I AM COMPLAINING AS WE HAD A GREAT WEEK, BUT I JUST WONDER WHERE THE BIGGER FISH WERE."
523471,Guest,2002-08-13 10:52:00,0,"VantThanks for posting the report, we were up there 7/13-7/20 this year and hit the may fly hatch at its peak. Sounds like your fishing was better than mine. That was our 4th year at five lakes lodge and next year we are set for 7/26-8/2. I found your post interesting about the leeches and crawlers. We normally only use minnows tipped with a charrouse jig and do quite well. I have caught them on leeches and crawlers but only when we run out of minnows. I think next year I will try more with the other baits. As far as fishing goes we normally catch many fish in the 20-26"" range during the week which I like to do. Our personal best for our group is 26 1/2"". My friend is there this week right now and I heard via email from the camp owner that they caught a 28"" fish so far this week. The week after we left someone in camp caught a 32"" walleye that week. I think there are huge fish in the Gullrock and it is a matter of where you drop the bait. I do notice there are alot of suspended fish when I am motoring around. That could be the really big one'sEither way I look forward to my trip every year and wish I could go twice, the fishing is really great there. Did you stay at five lakes lodge?Jeff"
523472,Guest,2002-08-13 11:45:00,0,"I always take 20 dozen crawlers and normally use all of them. This year it was either the walleyes would only hit minnows and not crawlers or visa versa. By the way, I had a 29"" and a larger one to the boat. How do they fight and not even be hooked, but just suck on the crawler. One ##### tough crawler!"
523473,Guest,2002-08-21 06:13:00,0,"Being our first trip, it took us a day or so to figure them out. We caught over 200 fish for the week, which I'm not sure is up to Gullrock standards or not. Weather was a bit up and down with rain almost every night and morning. Windy afternoons, with one day gusting up to 40 or 50 mph (3 to 4 footers on the Gullrock!). Mostly 12-15"", with six fish over 19"" and one at just over 28"". Suprisingly the smaller fish was the norm for size. Pink seemed to be the hot color. Of the fish we cleaned, most had empty stomachs. Some of the fish caught regurgitated what seemed to be smelt (3"" and longer). Also, we had what seemed to be freshwater shrimp (?) regurgitated in the livewell. That would explain why the pink color might be working well. We tipped the pink jigs with a small piece of crawler. Maybe most of the hogs were filled with shrimp and didn't feel too much like biting. It's definitely a good lake. I will say this, the lake is pretty heavily fished. All the spots that we had targeted had a boat or two on them. If and when I return, I'd like to get into the numerous 20"" plus fish that the lake seems to give up every year."
523474,VANT,2002-08-22 17:11:00,68,"PAUL,WHEN WERE YOU THERE, WHERE DID YOU STAY, & WHAT PARTS OF THE LAKE DID YOU FISH? LAST YEAR WE COULDN'T EVEN GET OUT ON THE BIG LAKE THE LAST DAY WE WERE THERE DUE TO THE WIND & THE WAVES. WE COULD BARELY GET OUT ON TWO ISLAND. CAN GET PRETTY WILD."
523475,Guest,2002-08-23 04:59:00,0,"Vant, We stayed at Five Lakes Lodge last week, nice place, nice owners. We fished some of the well-known spots such as the mid-lake hump, crow island (the island we named because of all the crows that go there at night which is west of the mid-lake hump), just off the boot peninsula and adjacent to a few other islands. All these spots produced fish, even though they were hit hard. We also found a couple lesser known spots that produced a few more fish.We were fishing in a 19.5 foot boat, the kind with a windshield. Was comfortable to fish out of, but difficult to control in the wind. We also had trolling motor problems. Sometimes if you can't stay directly over the fish, you ain't gonna get em. The bite was pretty light a couple a days. Maybe we'll try a camp boat next time. Paul"
523476,Guest,2002-10-07 10:46:00,0,Anyone been out lately?
523477,Guest,2002-10-08 09:35:00,0,I took my rod with me Sat. when I went out moose hunting on the lake I didn't see a moose but caught about 50 fish on the hump south of the gullrock very few under 18in. biggest was 26in. it might of been my last time out. who know I still have minnows hanging off the dock.
523478,VANT,2002-10-13 14:04:00,68,"BUD,HOW LATE ARE CAMPS OPEN ON GULLROCK? I THOUGHT THEY WOULD ALL BE CLOSED BY NOW? IS THE LATE FALL FISHING GOOD THERE? IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAD PRETTY GOOD LUCK THE OTHER DAY. THANKS FOR THE INFO."
523479,Guest,2002-10-20 10:21:00,0,Vant most camps close the last week of Sept.ours dose the fishing can be excellent depending on the weather.If you hit it right it's one big fish after another.Give sept. a try sometime.
