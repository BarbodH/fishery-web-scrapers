524768,Guest,2002-10-14 06:35:00,0,"Sticking to fishing (actually catching) and first hand facts will avoid anymore discussion on this topic. It is very apparent post #2 could be conceived as a hot bite on the Red. Anyone that has been there in the past week knows this is untrue, especially those who are familiar with the Red when the bite ""is on."" In the name of accuracy, there are a FEW walleyes being caught, but not to the expectation of nearly all who know and fish the Red.Many folks on this site depend upon sound info to make decisions regarding logistics, vacation time, etc. This includes a financial decision as well.Please, share good sound info (second hand reports of a scattered half a dozen or so big fish being caught does not constitute a ""wee-wee, the sumo's are going on the Red....."" posting. Also, please do not let personal or business relationships muddy the info as well. I sympathize with anyone that would have taken the posted info as ""sound"" and put in at Stu's to run to the End Of Main. I am not ignorant; Stu's boat landing was fairly sparse last week, I am certain he is feeling the financial effects generated from the poor fishing.I will no longer add to this post regarding mis-information. I do hope this is taken as constructive input."

I did not know that this is bad year for fishing the Red.

Last fall the latter it got the bigger the fish got, maybe this will be true in 2002? I have seen conditions change so fast on the Red River system that it can make your head spin.The Red is a long system, some 500+ miles. Each season one section or another produces better then others. The last section into the big lake gets a ton of well-deserved press for big fish as well as numbers, if the conditions are right. It is wise to remember there are other options, many others in fact.I have been on many a ""You should have been here yesterday"" type trips, too many. I learned to take advantage of the other options and systems in the region and have a back up plan handy.

The Selkirk Park ramps are not in the best state of repair these days. Lower water levels will compound the Selkirk Park ramp problems too.It is not that far of a run North from the Selkirk Park to the marsh or the slots into the big lake. From the ""Cats on the Red"" at the Lockport Dam to the lake is about a 30 min run, +/- 5 or 10 min, depending on what your running.Backwater Eddy...><sUMo>Backwater Guiding""Ed on the RED"""

The launch at End of Main is actually a provincial boatlaunch, is a good one with docking. (double ramp). Cost to launch is $5, I believe,and is collected by Brenda or BJ at the restaurant there. We just returned from a trip there, and fishing was slowwww. Good Luck."

At least that is what I believe I paid the last time I was not a guest. I prefer to stay at Stu's as the lodging and access is handy and well maintained and is my personal preference.As for how long a run it is, that as I said would vary +/- due to what you run and where you launch from, time fly's when your having fun..Eh.Yes, it can be a long cooooool run to the marsh & the lake, it is fall.Backwater Eddy...><sUMo>Backwater Guiding""Ed on the RED"""

Air temp swings causing a slow bite? I've hammered fish there for two days in cold bitter snow followed by two days in short sleeve weather.....every day! Water temp needs to be 45 or lower??? Bull!!

524764,Guest,2002-10-13 10:04:00,0,"I live in Winnipeg and fish the Red quite a bit in the fall.I think there are 3 reasons for the slow bite the last couple of years1.Commercial and native subsistence nets strung around the mouth of the Red and Winnipeg rivers, as well as native nets right in the Red river itself.2.The Federal Government is no longer dredging the mouth of the Red, and the rivermouth is silting in, getting shallower every year. They stopped doing this a couple of years ago.3.Overabundance of forage this year. As well as the shiners, there have been large hatches of drum and carp this year-a full walleye is harder to entice to bite.There may be other reasons that I am not seeing, but the majority of the guys I talk to agree these 3 are the main cause.Hope the winter bite is better!"

524751,Backwater Eddy,2002-10-11 02:57:00,3871,"The bait shop on main in Selkirk MB is handy and helpful. It is on the East Side on main.Maps of the Red are hard to find although I did find a fair one this fall of the section you're likely to be fishing. If you wish drop me an email & I will try to send it along to you. It has the Red River from the Lockport Dam to just short of the marsh as it enters into the big lake. It is a MB navigation map of the channels and the flats, helpful for trolling purposes. The greatest hazards are near the dam, rock bars in low water conditions or floating debris after heavy rains. Other then that the channel is easy to fallow and you would not have a great deal of concern with submerged hazards. The flow is low so you see very little floating hazards in comparison to the spring of the year. If they start working on the gates on the dam you may see logs all up and down the river, be cautious if they do.[email protected]Backwater Eddy...><sUMo>Backwater Guiding""Ed on the RED"""
524752,Cat Eye Outfitter,2002-10-11 13:13:00,9,"Hit and miss is the expression that best describes this years bite for many anglers that I've spoken to. I've personlly caught my share of 8-9#ers but the double digit sumos aren't there yet as in years past. We had a year similiar to this one the last time we had an el-nina fall/winter. The bite actually was actually better in November than October. Typically this kind of fall sees lots of variations in temperature and barometric pressure. As an example it was in the low 70's yesterday and today its in the 50's. The bite in this context is far from consistent. I've found that if the weather holds for a least a couple, three days the bite becomes more aggressive and predictable. In general we're seeing more and larger walleye as the season progresses but with a little less consistency than we are used to seeing on the Red and Winnipeg rivers."

Visited with a local taxidermist, has had only two trophy's delivered for mounting so far this year. We saw two fish netted while we were there.A few saying water temps still too warm (49 deg on day 1 to 47 deg on day 3).
