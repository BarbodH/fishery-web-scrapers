524416,DaveIN,2002-10-12 08:30:00,191,>none. do a fly-in Just curious why you say none.I have done several fly-ins and have found that I do just as well driving into Separation Lake and catch bigger walleye than I did on the fly-in.Dave
524417,Guest,2002-10-12 16:28:00,0,"Dave,I was being a bit sarcastic but i have done drive in's and fly ins and there is no comparsion overall with the fishing quality. It's common sense, if you fish were everybody (including locals) has access vs. limited fishing pressure and mostly CPR you will have better fishing in the fly in's. Just like drive-in's there are good fly in's and bad ones. But the good fly in's are far better than the best drive in's. sounds like you have not been to the good fly in's. To me it's worth the extra few hundred bucks to fly in. Also coming from the US the last i want to see while in canada is lots of boat traffice and god for bid water skiers. This is just my opinion take it for whats it's worth. Have fun"

524404,Ryan,2002-09-22 17:32:00,135,"Hi,I am planning on booking a trip for next summer, probably late July or August. I have fished Canada many times, but mostly in Lac Seul, which has been the best. I wanted to know everyone's opinion on the best drive to walleye lake, other than Lac Seul, in Ontario. I want to be able to use my own boat. Thanks!"

524409,BD,2002-10-01 22:09:00,739,I have been at Press Lake a few times and it is a very good walleye lake. The buildings of Press Lake Camp are the only buildings on the 9000 acre lake. There are housekeeping cabins and camp sites. For the housekeeping cabins the rates were $165.00 US per person with a four person per cabin minimum. Check out the Press Lake site at www.presslake.on.ca or check this post from the WC archives https://www.walleyecentral.com/cgi-bi...9&forum=canada

524412,BD,2002-10-02 10:06:00,739,The server the Press Lake site is hosted on was down for a short time. It's up and running again. If you search the WC archives for Press Lake Camp you will find some more threads with fishing reports etc. If you decide to go there I have some info I can send you on good fishing spots etc.
524413,Guest,2002-10-02 16:06:00,0,Musky Bay Resort on Rice Lake. Both the walleye fishing and the resort are very good.
