I've spent many, many years on the Red aswell as Pine Falls and I would have to admit that these last couple of years has been slower than the norm.However we have experienced patterns like these in the past and I beleave that we'll experience them again in the future. If we're to be truthful, there isn't one amongst us that would be so bold as to say why things are slow at this time. Absolutely ""nobody"" can accurately answer as to why! These past few days I've been conducting a little research into other well known walleye venues such as Tobin, the Rainy and even the Mighty Mississippi. The overall results are basically the same, it's slow all over. Why or how could this be the case, nobody knows for sure. So the fishing a little tougher that the norm, so what, it can only get better.See you on the water or on the ice!"
