524881,Guest,2002-10-20 09:35:00,0,"I agree completely with Bob. Last year fished first day with Fireline and was way too early setting the hook. Missed nearly half. Changed to mono that night and had much better success.If you are really experienced I would guess you will like the fireline or power pro better. But, for us that fish about once a year I like the feel that the mono gives me.And yes, I did catch my first 10 lb eye during opening week on mono in a snowstorm.Bob"
524882,River_eye,2002-10-20 16:12:00,1486,"I love the no-stretch lines as well for shallow water jigging. It allows me to throw my jig further from the boat, and still being able to feel it hit bottom. To me, mono gives me a bit of a numb feeling.I tell people, if they prefer mono, great, you can spend the money saved on some tackle or somthing. You always do the best with what you feel most comfortable with. I learned to fish with Fireline right from the beginning, so that probably has somthing to do with it."
524871,Larry,2002-10-14 12:13:00,357,i've read a lot about this line. sounds great. any of you all have any first hand knowledge? pro or con. thanks.
524872,Esox Warrior,2002-10-14 16:06:00,64,I really like the stuff. I use it most of the time. I even got Berkley to replace 3 spools of Whiplash I was dumb enough to buy with Fireline.
524873,Guest,2002-10-14 19:12:00,0,"I used it for the first time last month, bought 8 pound test, very strong , and it casts good, and i seemed to have less backlashes. I used to tie a knot and bite it off, i have to use a knife to cut this stuff, i doubt if a northern can bite through it . I was using the braided type, not the super mono. When i would hang up it was all i could do to pull it loose, without sliceing up my hands. Doubt if i by regular mono again."
524874,ggg,2002-10-14 19:24:00,115,I have been using Fireline since it first came out. In the right application it can't be beat! I use it for jigging and some casting.The no stretch makes it more sensitive. I also use it for making spinner rigs. It's not for everything and no one has told northerns that they can't bite it off ! Good Fishing.
524875,Larry,2002-10-16 09:11:00,357,"ok, ggg. now tell me what it is not good for. your post made me curious. larry"
524877,chrism,2002-10-16 17:30:00,429,"Speaking from experience - Northerns will bite through it with no problem - it's strength is in it's tensile strength, not abrasivness such as would be encountered in a pikes mouth or rubbing on rocks.It is good line, but in my opinion powerpro is that much better. I have not yet met anyone who has gone back to fireline since trying powerpro. It is more abrasion resistant, but still gets bit through by northerns!"
524876,boat nut,2002-10-17 08:23:00,1146,"I use fireline for trolling bottom bouncers, and it can't be beat. I fished recently with a crankbait troller, who uses rod holders. He states that the fireline is not good for that style of ""deadsticking"", and he prefers mono for that application."
524878,River_eye,2002-10-17 12:05:00,1486,"Hey Chris, I ended up trying powerpro beside fireline this year on seperate jigging rods. Also used the 30 lb power pro on my crank rod. Loved it on my crank/trolling rod, but still undecided on the jigging rod. It doesn't fray like fireline, but it's louder when reeling in, due to the braid texture.I reeled in a 20 lb pike this spring on just a 1/4 oz. jig no leader from 20-25 feet with the fireline and got it into the boat, so it won some brownie points with me there. Although the pike can still bite through it, it's still better than mono for abrasion resistance, I learned that from watching many inexperienced guests over the summer. The mono was most unforgiving, but the fireline did give the inexperience angler a bit of an edge.Take it easy"
524879,gms,2002-10-19 16:39:00,91,"For jigging I really enjoy the sensitivity fireline provides, for cranking I'm not convinced it is a good idea, soon as you get a little nick or some abrasion on the line you'll snap it like a piece of thread.Although this is a walleye page, would like to add that jigging for lakers at 80+ feet with Fireline is a treat over mono when ice fishing. Easier to get a good hook set."
524880,Guest,2002-10-19 19:07:00,0,Ok. What about the whole no-stretch thing and how the less experienced aglers tend to get to much feedback with fireline and set the hook too soon. Any cases of this happening? Last year I skipped the stuff for this reason. We tend to fish the walleyes early in the season in shallow water (often less than 7 feet) and I worried I'd be on them too soon...Bob
