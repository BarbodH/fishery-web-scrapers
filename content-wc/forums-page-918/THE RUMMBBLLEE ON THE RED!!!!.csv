524607,Ivy,2002-10-18 13:42:00,556,"I am supposed to be working this fine Friday afternoon but I just had to finish reading this thread Kinda of like watching Ali and Forman go after the heavy weight crown. Well, not quite. But for the love of god, can't you two guys ( Barney and Mike ) just get along? Didn't Rodney King teach us anything? The comments by Bill F. reminded me of the quote "" It is better to let somone THINK your an idiot, than to open your mouth and remove all doubt"" Ivy"
524608,Guest,2002-10-18 16:26:00,0,"HI, EVERYONE. I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU ALL THE STORY ABOUT HOW THIS LITTLE DEAL WITH MIKE AND MYSELF GOT STARTED. IT ALL STARTED RIGHT HERE ON WALLEYE CENTRAL. SEPTEMBER 5TH MIKE PUT IN A POST LOOKING FOR A COUPLE OF GUYS TO GO ON THIS TRIP TO THE RED RIVER. HE HAD A COUPLE OF GUYS WHO COULDN'T MAKE THE TRIP, SO HE WAS LOOKING FOR SOME PEOPLE TO GO. WELL, I ANSWERED HIS POST. I HAD NEVER FISHED THERE BEFORE, BUT I HAD JUST READ A BIG ARTICLE ON THE RED IN WALLEYE INSIDER. SO, WE E-MAILED EACH OTHER AND TALKED ON THE PHONE A COUPLE OF TIMES AND I DECIDED TO GO. THEN, I NOTICE THIS POST HERE ENTITLED ""CAN BARNEY CATCH WALLEYE?"" IT WAS MIKE. HE HAD POSTED THAT WE HAD TALKED ON THE PHONE AND THAT I SAID I WAS THE BEST WALLEYE FISHERMAN IN ILLINOIS. AND HE WANTED TO KNOW IF THAT WAS THE TRUTH. WELL, I HADN'T SAID ANTTHING LIKE THAT, SO RIGHT OFF THE BAT I FIGURE THIS MIKE IS SOME KIND OF JOKESTER. (WHICH I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH. I CAN APPRECIATE JOKESTERS) WELL, THAT POST SEEMED TO BE QUITE POPULAR WITH EVERYONE HERE. THEN AS THE TRIP GETS CLOSER, HE POSTS ANOTHER ONE, WHICH GOT LOST WHEN THEY SWITCHED TO THE NEW SERVER. I DECIDED THAT, SINCE MIKE WAS SUCH A JOKESTER, I WOULD POST ""THE RUMBLE ON THE RED"" AS A CHALLENGE TO MIKE AND THAT POST REALLY TOOK OFF. (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW) AT THIS TIME, WE HAD STILL NEVER MET. BUT IT WAS GREAT FUN, CHECKING TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY NEW POSTS FROM MIKE THAT I COULD FIRE BACK ON. AND THE REST OF YOU MADE IT GOOD FUN TOO. WE NEVER MET UNTIL HE PICKED ME UP ON THE WAY TO SELKIRK. WE GO ALONG FINE. IT WAS A GREAT TRIP, EVEN IF THE FISHING WAS A LITTLE SLOW. I CAN THANK WALLEYE CENTRAL FOR PUTTING THE TWO OF US TOGETHER. I THINK OF MIKE AS A GREAT FRIEND NOW. AND I HOPE WE CAN GET TOGETHER AGAIN FOR A FISHING TRIP. IT JUST AMAZES ME HOW MOST OF US OUTDOORSMAN AND WOMEN CAN GET ALONG WITH EACH OTHER. IT IS A COMMON BOND. IT HELPS WHEN BOTH OF YOU ARE A LITTLE NUTS, THOUGH. ANYHOW, THANKS AGAIN TO WALLEYE CENTRAL FOR PUTTING TOGETHER A TRUE FRIENDSHIP THAT SHOULD LAST FOR A LONG TIME. AND THANKS TO ALL OF YOU, FOR SHARING IN IT.LATER, BARNEY"
524609,Guest,2002-10-18 19:04:00,0,"Thank you for your kind words Barney. I agree with you 100% it is amazing how people with the same interest in fishing can find that this common thread leads into the most valuable thing that we can share while fishing being friendship and comradery. I completly enjoyed our fishing trip and meeting the ""Walleye God of Illinois"". Once again I was reminded that catching fish is only a bonus and that the real fun and excitment of fishing is being with friends and enjoying Mother Natures Gift. Barney ,thanks so much for answering my ad and thanks for a great time on the Red. Im looking forward to fishing with you again and I hope the next time we both catch some fish......I must finally admit you beat me like a drum when it came to catching fish. Your strategy to distract me was unique. I just couldnt get the picture out of my mind of you eating breakfast at the table in that PINK TEDDY with the little white hearts on it."

524612,Guest,2002-10-20 08:32:00,0,Got to hear if Barneys eyes clashed with his Teddy ?
524597,Guest,2002-10-14 20:36:00,0,"Barney has such a great imagination. But Im not going to change his numbers because he needs to have the support that will rally around him. Those fisherman who know me know the ""Rest of The Story""...Barney couldnt carry my rod case."
524598,GR8WTHUNTER,2002-10-14 22:04:00,618,I guess until there is a nutral observer we will never know who is the true walleye god. To make it fair and unbiased I think each of you should pay half for the observer next year. Aplications for the observer can be submitted here on WC. Rich
524599,Guest,2002-10-15 05:39:00,0,Just got the pictures back and all the pictures with fish are of my Mikey with Hog Walleye. There is one picture of Barney with a cup of coffee watching Mike land a Hog but no Barney fish pictures.
524600,Guest,2002-10-15 14:27:00,0,"Are you two knob goblins still at it??Fishing was slow...blah, blah, blah. Sounds to me like neitherone of you are even fishermen enough to carry my tackle box."
524601,Guest,2002-10-15 15:34:00,0,This Bill guy STILL has a woodrow for you two? Sounds like he's got sugar in his blood.
524602,Larry,2002-10-15 20:53:00,357,"Dear site administrator:How can you allow this garbage on the site? I enjoy coming to this site to read the posts. We are all very lucky to be able to get out into the fresh air and enjoy our sport. What purpose does this thread have? These ""gods"" should exchange e-mail addresses and quibble on their own, or is this the type of thing you want in this site????Sorry for this post but I just had to get it out.Thanks Larry"
524603,Kodiak,2002-10-15 23:33:00,24,"Larry,I think you need to lighten up. I love to see people challenging one another and having fun while doing so. If you can't lighten up and allow a couple of nice guys to have fun with the sport then please, find another web site where people have no sense of humor. Barney and Mike, I love the story. I couldn't stop reading all of the responses. They were funny as #####. Fish on,Kodiak"
524604,Reels,2002-10-16 06:57:00,2876,"Have to agree, Larry, lighten up dude.It is like TV, if you dont like it, don't turn it on.<{{}}><"
524605,Guest,2002-10-16 19:30:00,0,Just got back the film in my other camera. Had some nice pictures of Barney with the Carp he snagged and several good pictures of Barney with his Master Angler Bullheads. The rest of the pictures had me holding My Hog Walleyes....Barney was in the background of one of my Hog Walleye pictures with his fingers crossed. Its so pathetic to see a man grovel with his inability.
524606,Guest,2002-10-18 11:25:00,0,"I too enjoyed the banter from these two hilarious windbags. I am glad Larry enjoys the web site, like all of us, and think in hindsite he might look for the humor in this. There are some very informativechats among the other topics, but this has been a great source ofhumor for a month now...what is wrong with that Larry? If two fisherman can talk for a month without being windbags, liars and pranksters who would want too fish with them anyway. Too bad the bite was slow.....maybe you guys should head to the red for a December ice fishing trip. The rest of us don't want to wait until next fall for a rematch. Get a Missouri guide to go with you this time......they don't call it the Show-me state for nothing. Or take Bill F....the bull head might enjoy his personality....they do bite stinkbait don't they? keep up the good work you two."
524586,Guest,2002-10-04 13:04:00,0,"I'm so glad that Mike is finally out the door headed on what might be his last fishing trip to Canada this year. This will be his seventh week in Canada this year and to be frank I'm getting tired of eating Walleye and paying to have all those big Walleyes mounted. But on the other hand, this might give me time to go SHOPPING for a bigger house... to include a bigger Walleye room. The Walleye room has so many trophies, mounted walleye's, and fish pictures on the wall... the house is starting to lean in that direction, due to all the weight. Also that D@#$ big screen TV, in which he watches his HUGE collection of Walleye catching videos... it is driving me nuts! I vote that next year... this trip... that WOMEN be allowed to go... as WE ARE the masters of everything! Happy Fishing!Note to Barney's wife... I have never met you, and I'm sure you're a lovely lady... but just be prepared to give a lot of love and support to Barney when he returns... He will be depressed for many many months! Don't get me wrong, as Barney will have a great time, and he will catch many fish... BUT nobody and I mean nobody... can catch as many BIG walleye's as my little Mikie!Regards,Janet ""Mike's wife"""
524588,Guest,2002-10-04 13:23:00,0,"Hi there Mikey's wife. Maybe your husband should be enlightened. Has he ever heard of catch and release fishing??? That is when you catch the fish, then you let it go, so that one day you can return and possibly catch it again. He should try it sometime, instead of heading up to Canada every year and raping their beautiful lakes. What a typical Yankee ""meat fisherman"".....he should be embarrassed. How many friggin' wall mounts does a guy need anyhow????? Hope many filets does a person need in the freezer anyhow????? Sounds to me like your hubby needs some educating on positive conservation practises. Friggin' ""meat fisherman""!!!PS-I'm American by the way, and I'm sick of seeing my countrymen act just like this boob. CATCH AND RELEASE PEOPLE. One last thing, there is absolutely nothing wrong with keeping a few for the table either. I'm not a PETA rep or anything, but this guy sounds like a real greedy fellow. Leave some for the next guy instead of thinking about your big fat gut all the time, is all I'm trying to say.Take Care,Bill F."
524589,Guest,2002-10-04 15:27:00,0,"Bill, Mike only brings home his possesion limit and all the mounts are replicas.In fact on three of his fly in trips this year he didnt bring home any fish. His motto is catch and release and he told me about and I read about your ##### ATTITUDE...Do me a favor and dont write anything to me again...none of us appreciate your wierd sense of humor."
524590,Guest,2002-10-04 21:28:00,0,"LOL...As I lay here trying to sleep with my laptop a runnin wondering how quickly I'll make the trip to the Red tomorrow I had to bust a gut over Mrs. Mike's response to dip poop. I had the pleasure to talk to Barney a week or so back, called to get the skinny on the big greenbacks from this Omaha boy. Sounded like a nice feller..am hoping to run into the big purple guy hopefully this week, which means I'll probably meet Mike as well. Keep giving them ##### Mrs. Mike..looks like you can handle your own."
524591,Guest,2002-10-05 11:41:00,0,"What dribble, is there anyone on earth that can't catch thousands of Walleye on Lac Suel???"
524592,Guest,2002-10-05 12:08:00,0,AMEN!!!
524593,Guest,2002-10-12 10:05:00,0,"Just got back from the Red and fishing for a week with Barney. Good old Barney may be a legend in Illinois but when it comes to fishimg against ""THE MASTER"" Barney is still learning. In fact I had to show Barney how to tie on his jigs. When I last saw Barney he was walking up the drive way with his head bent over and his hat in his hand....Barney is good...but not great!!!!"
524594,Guest,2002-10-14 07:21:00,0,Mike told me that Barney actually gave him a fishing lesson on the trip to the Red River. Barney must have really layed one on poor old Mike because Mike is trying to sell all his Walleye fishing equipment and is going to take up Bowling. Mike said that Barney caught 10 pounders and bunchs of 5 and 6 pounders and Mike also said that Barney is probably the best Walleye fisherman he has ever been in a boat with.....well I have to go...got to take Mike down to pick out some bowling shoes.
524595,GR8WTHUNTER,2002-10-14 09:15:00,618,"OK Barney and Mike, did you keep a taly sheet. How about some numbers from the 2 greatest walleye guys ever to float on the Red?There are many who want the real scoop. There is a lot of money riding on this. Did Mike cover the spread? Lets see some numbers. Rich"
524596,Guest,2002-10-14 18:18:00,0,"I KNOW YOU ARE ALL WAITING IMPATIENTLY FOR THE RESULTS FROM THE ""RUMBLE ON THE RED"". THEY ARE NOT THE NUMBERS EITHER OF US WERE HOPING FOR, BUT THE BITE WAS VERY SLOW, AS YOU CAN TELL FROM THE POSTS ON THE ""RED RIVER UPDATE"". OF COURSE, MIKE'S REPORT FROM OCT. 12TH WAS FAR FROM THE TRUTH, ALTHOUGH HE DID SHOW ME A NEW KNOT, WHICH I WILL NO DOUBT BE IN HIS DEBT FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. THE REPORT EARLIER TODAY BY HIS WIFE WAS MUCH MORE ACCURATE. ALTHOUGH, I DIDN'T CATCH BUNCHES OF 5 & 6 POUNDERS. ALL WEEK, WE GOT 5 FISH OVER 24"". BARNEY CAUGHT 4 OF THEM AND MIKE CAUGHT 0. ONE FISH OVER 10#, AND ONCE AGAIN IT WAS BARNEY WHO BROUGHT HOME THE GOLD. IT WAS 10.5 POUNDS. ALL IN ALL, IT WAS PRETTY SLOW, BUT IT WAS MY FIRST WALLEYE OVER 10 POUNDS AND IT WAS A REAL THRILL. SERIOUSLY THOUGH,I HAVE TO THANK MIKE FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO AND EXPERIENCE THAT. I HAD A REALLY GOOD TIME AND MAYBE WE CAN DO IT AGAIN SOMETIME, WHEN THERE IS A BETTER BITE, SO THAT WE HAVE SOME BETTER NUMBERS TO REPORT. BUT, FOR THIS YEAR, WE ALL KNOW WHO THE MASTER WAS. DON'T WE, MIKEY? OH, I DIDN'T MEAN TO RUB IT IN, THAT JUST KIND OF SLIPPED OUT. OH YEAH, I DID MANAGE TO SNAG THE BIG CARP FOR THE WEEK WHILE TROLLING SOME CRANKS, TOO. I THOUGHT I BETTER THROW THAT IN THERE, SO MIKE DIDN'T THINK I WAS LETTING SOMETHING OUT. ANYHOW, THANKS AGAIN, MIKE. AT LEAST NEITHER ONE OF US WERE THE BULLHEAD CHAMP OF THE BOAT,EH? I AM GLAD THAT ""MOST"" EVERYONE SEEMED TO ENJOY THIS ""RUMBLE ON THE RED"" AND TOOK IT IN THE CONTEXT IT WAS MEANT. JUST SOME PLAIN, SIMPLE FUN. LATER, BARNEY"
524577,Guest,2002-10-02 18:33:00,0,Atta Boy Barney....keep up the positive attitude. Its always so much more fun to outfish a man when he is at the top of his game. You make a worthy advisary. I will be proud to have your scalp on my belt. Make sure and bring a large crying towel to wipe the tears from your face when the gloom of defeat overcomes you and you finally realize that the Master owns you.
524578,Guest,2002-10-03 04:17:00,0,"Mike, After reading this posting I have to wonder do you have access to a rehab program for Barney when he returns from the fishing trip? It appears that Barney is going to be in pretty bad shape and Im concerend about the long term effects of the whipping he is going to take. Maybe if the last day you are with him you could hook a couple of fish and let Barney reel them in it would start him on the road to recovery. Mike you have a tremendous burden on your shoulders and anything you can do to get Barney back on the road to recovery after his total butt whipping Im sure would be greatly appreciated by his family and friends."
524587,Reels,2002-10-03 05:31:00,2876,Wouldnt it be funny if a severe cold front moves in and they both get skunked?Just kidding... glad to see you guys having fun.<{{}}><
524579,Guest,2002-10-03 05:38:00,0,"Todd, You are very perceptive. I have already made arrangements for Barney to be dropped off at the Mayo Clinic on the trip home. The Mayo has a special program for battered Walleye fisherman. I have had to admit many other fisherman into the program and the normal recovery period is about three months. Im concerned that Barneys recovery period could be longer than average because he really thinks that he has a chance to defeat the Master. I like your idea about letting him reel in some of my fish and I will do all I can to not devestate him to extensively. I definitly will let Barney have his picture taken with some of my fish so he will have some pictures to show his family and friends back in Illinois. I have never met Barney but during conversations with him on the phone he sounds like he is a good man and may well be able to manage the long term effects of a Walleye butt whipping that will definitly occur. He will be in Mayos by 5:00 PM on Saturday October 12. Please address any ""get well"" cards to him at the Walleye Crisis Center C/O Mayos."
524580,Eye Catcher,2002-10-03 06:46:00,85,"With all this smack going back and forth I think we will really never know who the master is. Is there going to be any reliable witnesses to the predicted but whoopin', or are we going to have to take your word on this. As we all know fisherman are the best liars so we will need undisputable proof out side of killing any big fish."
524581,Guest,2002-10-03 06:53:00,0,"Eye Catcher, We have made arrangements for Arthur Anderson Consulting to perform an audit on ""Rummbbllee On The Red"" with the same detail that they cooked Enrons books at. Im sure this meets all the standards required for fisherman and other liars."
524582,Guest,2002-10-03 12:08:00,0,"MIKE...YOU CANT BE SERIOUS. BARNEY HAS NEVER CAUGHT A WALLEYE OVER 22"". ITS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT HE IS EVEN WOTRH ACCEPTING A CHALLENGE FROM. I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT YOU WILL GIVE HIM THE SPANKING HE DESERVES. BY THE WAY MIKE DO YOU STILL HAVE THE MOUNT ON THAT 38"" WALLEYE YOU CAUGHT IN ONTARIO?"
524583,Guest,2002-10-03 12:31:00,0,"JIMMY, IF YOU HAVEN'T FIGURED THIS OUT BY NOW, YOU CAN'T BELIEVE A WORD THAT MIKE CHARACTER HAS TO SAY. IF HE OPENS HIS MOUTH, HE IS LYING. WE ARE SOON TO SEE. BARNEY"
524584,Guest,2002-10-03 13:38:00,0,"Barney, You Devil You....stay spunky.....bring some bandages and a cushion for you to sit on."
524585,Jim,2002-10-03 20:55:00,238,I think Barney sounds like a good bet.
524567,Guest,2002-10-01 20:19:00,0,"Barney, I think that you have created this ""Bill F"" to try to throw me off my game. Barney Im still going to bury you in Walleye and the sad thing about it is I cant help it...Greatness always prevails !!! New line from Las Vegas 125 to 1. Bring your camera...you can hold my fish and get your picture taken....I OWN YOU."
524568,Guest,2002-10-02 08:29:00,0,"Sorry Mike, I'm real...and you still sound like a couple of fags.I'd also like to add that the next time J.R. and Hopeful go out to the store, they should try buying themselves a sense of humor.But don't fret Mike, I'm pulling for you because when I think of your competition, I get this visual image of Barney Rubble fishing from the back of some beat up old boat.... and I just can't bring myself to root for a boorish, club carrying caveman who will probably try catching his fish with his teeth. Good luck"
524569,Guest,2002-10-02 08:51:00,0,"Bill F, Wish I could say it was nice to hear from you again. Sounds like your sense of humor is a bubble out of plum...You dont need to root for Barney or me....we will be fine without your support or input."
524570,Guest,2002-10-02 09:08:00,0,Sounds like this Bill wants some input of a different {read queer} kind! what a zero.
524571,Peanut,2002-10-02 09:13:00,929,"Hey Mike - a friend of mine saw Barney in a grocery store yesterday asking about whole frozen walleye - he wanted a ""big one"", he said, for a ""special surprise"". Apparently the fish girl told him they had some very fresh fillets, but he was not interested in those - he only wanted a whole fish.I don't know if this means anything, but my friend is an avid WC reader, and asked me to pass this info along to you.Good luck (and them brown things floating on the Red are NOT chocolate bars, no matter what Barney tells you). derrek.""I'll teach these eyes to see,beyond these walls in front of me""- Bruce Springsteen, ""Trapped"""
524572,Guest,2002-10-02 09:25:00,0,"Peanut, Thanks for the info on Barney and his fish purchaseing expedition. what Barney doesent understand is he cant carry enough fish to avoid the caboosse whipping he is going to get. Barney and I have never fished together before and he just cant understand what it is like to fish with a Walleye catching machine.....The biggest Walleye Barney has ever caught is just 22"" long....I just measure mine between the eyes and a 5"" is a Trophy....I will watch for those FLOATERS....Thanks Again, Mike"
524573,Eye Catcher,2002-10-02 10:47:00,85,"Okay Mike, I see you asking for reports on the Red on the Fishing Reports Board. IF and I mean If you are so good why do you have to ask for reports. I am starting to lean towards Barney on this one. Besides if his biggest is only 22 he is due for a Pig. I only wish I could be there to see the competition and maybe even join in on the fun. We are arriving in Selkirk on the 12th and will probably scout some ducks and geese before getting out on the river.Good Luck Guys"

524575,Guest,2002-10-02 12:10:00,0,"Eye Catcher, You have solidified my strategy. In a effort to keep Barneys enthusiasim up I have been soliciting fishing condition reports from the Red. This develops a false sense of security in Barney because he thinks that I dont know what to do or where to go. In the past when I have fished with new people they sometimes shy away when they see my prowness as a Walleye fisherman....Barney will not totally understand the Masters skills until he is in the boat and fishing next to greatness. I dont think he will try to swim for shore but you never know about the non fish catching type."

524558,Guest,2002-09-30 14:53:00,0,So many non-believers. Peanut my friend Mike catchs thousands of Walleyes every summer. His Walleye fishing ability is unparralled. Now I dont know this guy from Illinois but when the contest is over Barney(Illinois Boy)will be pushing up Daisys. I just hope Mike doesent destroy him mentally. Barney needs to be able to accept defeat. Maybe he could practice learning defeat by wearing a Viking uniform.
524559,Guest,2002-10-01 09:09:00,0,"Was just figuring it up...about 101 hours until Mike and Barneydrop the first jig over the side of boat to test Red River. About102 hours until the fighting Illini representative starts waving the white flag. Hope you have some spirits with which to drown yoursorrows my new pork state friend. (Don't take rum, the Polish Master will drink it all and show no signs of pollution) Have a great tripand leave some for me. Next year I am in for certain. I will have to fill in for Barney if his pride forces him to stay home."

I wont even get in to what I would like to say to you because that is not what Walleye Central is about. But maybe you should engage your brain before your mouth.

524548,Guest,2002-09-27 15:44:00,0,"Barney, Seems you have thrown down the gauntlet my friend. You are a man of tremendous courage to challenge a man like myself who is not only a legend in his own mind but who also has filled boot hill with many who thought they could stand in the same boat and fish with the Babe Ruth of Big Walleyes. You have made a mistake....when our trip to the Red is over you will know what it is like to stand next to a man who hauls in Hog Walleyes fast enough to make your little Illinois head spin. Barney my boy,you will be fishing next to greatness..Las Vegas odds are in Barney and you are a 10 to 1 underdog."

524550,Guest,2002-09-27 17:27:00,0,"Barney, You have bitten off more than you can chew. I have fished with Mike for many years in fact I was supposed to be on this trip to the Red but had to cancel. We call Mike ""THE POLISH MASTER"" he has been catching Monster Walleye since 1957. I have personally fished with him on at least 30 trips to Canada and he has whipped my caboose every time. You will see that after he gets ahead of you 4 or 5 fish he will stop fishing and give you a chance to catch up...and than he will blitz you again. However he is gracious in Victory he wont rub it in but when that big old 6ft 6in 270 body holds up another Walleye and those cold eyes twinkle at your non-fish catching butt you will know that THE MASTER is from Kansas. I put $100 on Mike."
524551,Duane,2002-09-28 15:52:00,8,"Barney, I also have fished with Mike on many trips to Canada and I was one of the people who had to pass up the Red Riiver trip because of a previous commitment. Barney you probably dont realize hoew lucky you are to have a chance to fish in the presence of Mikes greatness. He is without a doubt the finest Walleye fisherman to ever grace the clear blue waters of Canada. When we have gone to Outpost Camps in the past the Lodge Owners have asked us not to come back for several years because Mike will catch so many fish that it seems like the whole lake is sore mouthed. He was recently invited to the Queens Ball and recieved the highest award the Queen can bestow on anyone ""QUEENS GOLDEN WALLEYE AWARD"". Barney relish your time with him ...he is the best. If you are lucky he might let you get your picture taken with one of his Hog Walleyes."
524552,Guest,2002-09-29 16:27:00,0,"Ya...ok guys......... sounds to me like your both full of the stuff I just stepped in and don't like the smell of.Forget the Red, Lac Sould whatever and find a lake where a real fisherman can show his stuff.I'll bet I can take either one of you hands down here on Lac Soul, so com'on up anytime after Oct. 7 and put your money where your mouth is."
524553,Guest,2002-09-29 17:38:00,0,"Viper, I love Lac Seul. Have been fishing out of Lac Seul Lodge for the last ten years. It is a great lake and I would love to accept your challenge.....but alas I must go to the Red. Do you live in the Lac Seul area???"
524554,Guest,2002-09-30 07:37:00,0,"Hi Mike, I sure do.. Live between Sioux Lookout and Hudson.Can't get much better fishing on Lac Soul, i'm usually on the lake just about every day.If your up this way next year let me know and maybe we can have a few pints.Have fun on the Red.Viper"
524555,Guest,2002-09-30 10:03:00,0,"Dear Viper, I know you read about Mike and find it hard to believe. What I find hard to believe is that people continue to challenge him. For the sake of your family and your manhood withdraw your challenge....he cant be beat. He was banned from the Pro Tour,he is not allowed to fish in 16 different states, one Canadian Provience actually pays him to not fish in their lakes because its cheaper to pay him than restock the lakes. Pull back Viper and whatever you do dont challenge him to a drinking contest."
