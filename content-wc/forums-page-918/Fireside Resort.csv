I checked the WC archives and found zero matches. If it is so good, when is the best time to go for walleye and musky??? Many Thanks."

No big muskies but lots of action. I think if we would have been later the muskie fishing would have been better. We also caught some nice smallmouth while casting for pike and musky. There are no walleyes in the system. They provided walleyes for shore lunch. We went American plan and the food was real good. I would recommend them to anyone. Great service and great people."

You have a good chance to see some big muskie but the one you catch will average 32 inches and weigh about nine pounds. Best time of year is late summer through fall. It is a heavily fished lake system. On the up side, it is one of the best lake systems for big smallmouth bass. Any time of year for them. No walleye.As for walleye, as noted in earlier post, Minnitaki Lake is one of the best lake systems for walleye and Pickerel Arm Camp is one of the best camps in the area. Best time of year is 2nd or 3rd week in June thru July, then again in September."
