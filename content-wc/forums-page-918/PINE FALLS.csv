524973,Guest,2002-10-17 21:34:00,0,"WE RETURNED FROM PINE FALLS THIS EVENING. WE FISHED THE RED FOR A HALF DAY ON SUNDAY AND DID NOT GET A BITE. WE THEN PROCEEDED TO PINE FALLS AND FISHED THAT AFTERNOON. NOT A FISH. MONDAY WE MANAGED TO CATCH 3 WALLEYE. ONE WAS 6.5 LBS THE OTHERS SMALL. TUESDAY WE ATTEMPTED TO GO OUT ON TWO OCCASIONS BUT IT WAS JUST TWO ROUGH. EVERYONE COMING IN SAID GO BACK TO THE MOTEL. NO FISH AND HUGE WAVES. WE STUCK AROUND AND WENT OUT WEDNESDAY MORNING AND CAUGHT THREE SMALL WALLEYES. THREE OF US CAUGHT A TOTAL OF 6 WALLEYES IN 4 DAYS. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE GOING UP THERE, WE DID LET ALL SIX GO SO I KNOW THERE ARE AT LEAST SIX LEFT UP THERE. HAVE BEEN TO PINE FALLS FOR THE PAST 4 YEARS, AND IT STARTED OUT AS THE BEST FISHING I HAVE SEEN AND HAS DECLINED EVERY YEAR SINCE. THIS IS THE LATEST WE HAVE GONE BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN TOLD SEVERAL TIMES THAT WHEN THE WATER HITS 45 DEGREES THAT IS PRIME TIME. WELL IT WAS 46 DEGREES. I PERSONALLY CAUGHT THREE WALLEYES AND PNEUMONIA. WE LEFT EARLY AND STOPPED AT CABELAS IN EAST GRAND FORKS AND ADMIRED THE WALLEYES IN THEIR TANKS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING THERE, AND DO NOT KNOW IF WE WILL MAKE THE TRIP NEXT YEAR."

Tuesday had food poisioning and only got out for about 2 hours but dismal results for sure. I have been going up there for seven years and also have seen the fishing decline every year. Answer to why, there have been many good theories posted here in the last few weeks. I believe it is combination of many. The bottom line is the fishing is not what it was.I don't know if I will be making the trip next year either. I have gone up there at the same time each year and this year should have been one of the better, but????"

524976,Guest,2002-10-18 18:42:00,0,sorry to see you guys not having any luck.the major problem is thereis no current generation coming out of the dam .
524977,chrism,2002-10-19 02:29:00,429,"DudesYes the fishing has been slow and may continue as such - however- those of you that have been on the water the past 10 or so days... well, you hit a cold, windy front - the fish have had lockjaw supreme!I don't disagree with the posts of it being sh##tty fishing as compared to years past, but the weather both last year and this year has been exceptional sh##ty to boot - In my opinion, it has affected the fishing......Mama nature is having her period... Patience is required before jumping to any conclusions.FYI the Average high temp for this date is 10(50f), and the actual temp and predicted is 0 (32f) to -3 (26f)."
524978,gms,2002-10-19 16:33:00,91,Have not given up yet.....last year when the nets came off is when the fishing got hot. And if the ice comes early even better as I'm anxious to have a chance to get my ice shack up at Pine Falls. The last 3 years have been nasty for those who enjoy fishing above Manitou Rapids.Still waiting...
