524982,Guest,2002-10-18 13:01:00,0,"Just wondering if anyone has ever fished on the Montreal River system north of Sault Ste Marie. I have an oppurtunity to purchase some land on the river but I don't know what the fishing is like. I've heard there is good walleye, pike and lake trout in the river.If anyone has ever fished the river please let me know.ThanksMoe"
