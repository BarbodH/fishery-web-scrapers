524706,Guest,2002-10-17 07:23:00,0,How about a GOOD GUIDE STORY...Fished this year on Lake Oahe with Greg Adams and he worked his buns off to make our trip very enjoyable. I dont use Guides much but I have never had a bad experience with one. However I have seen some other fisherman on Guide trips who needed to be dropped off on a island and picked up at the first snow.
524707,Backwater Eddy,2002-10-17 08:51:00,3871,"Good or bad, the client should let the guide know exactly what he or she has in mind for the trip. It is your day and your dollar, don't be shy about setting things straight as soon as you feel it has gone astray.If that doesn't work, in a good strong voice look the guide directly in the eye and say, ""BAD...BAD GUIDE"" Then slap him on the nose with a rolled up newspaper. That should bring about change, of some form.:DBackwater Eddy...><sUMo>Backwater Guiding""Ed on the RED"""
524708,Guest,2002-10-17 14:31:00,0,"Whats good for the goose is also good for the gander. Guides boats should be equipped with ejection seats. When the ""client"" gets out of hand first he gets a mild electric shock, them a major electric shock and then.........ejection into the bush. There are numerous examples of ""bad behaviour""....if you break the law its instant ejection.........................I think I've been at work too long...."
524695,Guest,2002-10-04 04:32:00,0,"With the discussion in previous subjects about bad guides I thought I would share the followingBuddy was fishing with familly in Northern Manitoba with a hired Native guide. As they were moving along they spotted a young Moose swimming. The guide ran the boat into the Moose and with his knife cut its throat and towed it to shore. He then took his kit out told the shocked occupants...come back in one hour. Why not share your ""bad guide"" experiences with us."
524696,woman,2002-10-04 11:58:00,2,"Ok, How about hearing about the great guide experience? I'm ready for a little upper life has enough downers. Let's get a roll on the positive side for awhile.:-)"
524697,Guest,2002-10-04 17:48:00,0,"i know of a guide who fishes on Eagle lake,that takes his guests to the bear narrows bridge from may to oct.He doesnt catch much fish but his guests are fed weedy pike and perch.He hasnt been tiped in 5 years,but still has his job at a ritzy lodge so keep coming suckers."
524698,Northern Manitoban,2002-10-05 13:20:00,195,"Wzird.Where in Northern Manitoba was this i live in Northern Manitoba.I laughed when i read your post but i believe it,i know what the natives are like up here.Kill anything that moves net anything that swims.I guide here myself,so you ever up here i'll be around.Good story lol.FISH ON."
524700,River_eye,2002-10-07 11:49:00,1486,"I am a guide, so I don't have any bad guide stories, but I do have some bad guest stories.I was guiding a group of guys from the twin cities and all they were concerned about was ""meat"". One of the guys actually used that word many times during the day. Once their limit of walleyes was filled, they needed to fill their pike limit. They ignored the Manitoba barbless hook rule even after I reminded them a few times. One of the guys proceded to catch a 36"" pike which was hooked deep with five barbed hooks, the fish was out of the water for nearly 10 minutes, it swam away, but I don't think it survived. The same guy also had me use the net to grab a pike that was near the surface trying to get a lamprey eel off it's fin. This man was not a sportsman, he was what us guides refer to as a meat hunter.It goes both ways."
524701,Guest,2002-10-08 09:52:00,0,I had 2 guys staying at my camp they found a guide at a local bar in town he took them out fishing he told them they could keep fish that were inside the slot because his wife was a native he threw the trash (beer bootles) from the shore lunch in the bush also threw bottles in the lake while fishing. He charged them 100 bucks Can. I guess you get what you pay for. needless to say the C O'S found out about the guy.
524702,Guest,2002-10-08 16:36:00,0,"Can't be much of a guide drinking out of bottles. A real ""guide"" would have been drinking out of cans and having a flask in his upper shirt pocket. No breakage or spillage. That taking the fish for the wife thing has been tried over and over...OMNR enforcement keeps writing and writing and taking equipment..........."
524703,phishfearme,2002-10-11 14:15:00,1242,this also sounds like a negative guide story - what kind of guide repeatedly permits his clients to violate the law and does nothing about it?phish
524704,River_eye,2002-10-11 19:41:00,1486,"Yeah, right, like I'm going to take him back to the lodge and tell him he's not allowed to fish anymore. I'm not a vigilante. Don't know where you come from, but in the world of business and economics, the customer is always right.....unfortunately in some cases."
524705,Piscatorian,2002-10-11 22:11:00,12,"This sounds a lot like a guide I met up there...the guide I know would also brag about drowning moose from a boat by grabbing their heads and holding them under water. Even worse to me, anyway... he would poach thousands of walleyes every year (he was 1/2 native or something) so as a ""treaty"" guy he could apparently get away with it, although I don't think the lodge owner knew. It couldn't be the same guy, could it? The guy I know worked at a certain lodge, I've name here before in Northern Manitoba. The family that owns the lodge has a name with 4 characters that rhymes with ""pens.""Man, I've got tons of bad guide stories, including two more from this very same lodge!!! Yes, I'm just that lucky. Sad, but true. Alright, here's the second one. We pay good money to go to this lodge and get there and were not doing very well. We find out on the 3rd day that its only our guides 2nd week on the lake. He had guided before on a lake 500 miles away but had no clue where to find fish on this lake. What's worse, is that the lodge and/or other guides didn't even train the guy at all. My buddy and I ended up getting more fish in the evenings ON OUR OWN within 5 miles of the lodge than we ever did with the guide running all over the lake. Geez, I just can't stop. On the second day of the same trip, the lodge owner is to be our guide. The fishing is pretty poor, and we struggle most of the day. In the afternoon, I hook a very nice walleye trolling. At the time, it was the nicest walleye I ever had on in my life. As I bring the fish to the boat, the owner/guide misses the net job badly. No problem, I bring the fish to the boat again. He misses again. Exasperated, I bring the fish to the boat for a third time. This time, he misses again and actually knocks the fish off the hooks at the same time! I am crushed. But that's not the end of the story. On the same day, he has a large iron skillet that he stores in the front of the boat(after lunch for some reason) sticking straight up by sliding the handle down into the gap in front of that little seat/platform or whatever you all it in the very front of the boat. That afternoon, we hit some good waves and the iron skillet comes flying out, just missing me, but landing on my brand new heavy casting rod and breaking it it half. Mind you, this was the owner of the lodge. He offered a brief apology and told me there were some rods (as it turned out, old fiberglass crap) that I could use for the remainer of the trip. Needless to say, we never returned."
