524862,lenray,2002-10-13 14:06:00,467,I fish numerous lakes north of Superior that are in the bush rather difficult to get to and have never seen others there while we were there.I have been thinking about going up with snowmachines and try fishing them in the winter they are trout and pike lakes--the ones I am thinking about going to and it could be a 20 mile ride or so on the machines to get into them.Was wondering if any of you fish up there in the winter and what you could share with me concerning the experience.These lakes would be approx.40-50 miles from Longlac and might stay there in a hotel if we didn't camp at the lakes.len
524863,Guest,2002-10-17 08:58:00,0,I live in south-central Ontario. The temps have started dropping at night but not enough to freeze anything solid. I'd say I'm still at least 2 months away from ice fishing in my neck of the woods. Last year we had daytime temperatures in the 60's right through November and I didn't get the hut onto the lake until after New Years!!! Chalk it all up to Global Warming.
