525004,McQ,2002-10-21 15:26:00,615,Deadrise on the Pro 166 is 13 degrees.
525005,Guest,2002-10-21 20:20:00,0,Thanks for the info. I was checking the Pro166 out at John's Marina near Carleton Place last week. Unfortunately he doesn't have any Pro174 in at this time to compare. It is a toss up between the 2 models.Jim
524994,Chaz,2002-10-18 15:28:00,46,I am considering purchasing a Princecraft Pro 174 and I am curious if any one out there has one.Thanks.
524995,McQ,2002-10-18 17:19:00,615,"I used the same hull as the 174 in a back troller version last season Chaz - the boat is very well built, tons of storage and is a stable platform. What are you thinking of powering it with?"
524999,Guest,2002-10-19 04:39:00,0,"I previously owned a Pro 176 and a Pro 178, nicer & better look then a Lund alot cheaper so you can spend your money on other things. Very satisfied. If there is a minus it's the trailer build by Remeq this is not top quality better of with a Shoreland'r."
524996,Guest,2002-10-19 11:43:00,0,"I have been considering the Pro 174 or the Pro 166 as well.It was thinking of powering the Pro 174 with a 90 hp 4 str. Mercury. It is rated for 115 hp, but money is abit of an issue and the 115 4str. is $1700 (Canadian) more than with the 90 hp."
524997,Chaz,2002-10-19 15:47:00,46,"McQ,I'm probably going to power it with a 90 classic. I have been around carbed 2 strokes for 40+ years and they have always treated me well. The 4 strokes and hi-tech 2 strokes are OK but not for me, yet.I was in a SP166 and a SP178DLX and they seem to be a very well built boat. The 174 seems to be a good size with a reasonable price. I was quoted $14,500 for the 174 with a 90 Merc classic and galvanized trailer.I believe the Pro 174 has a 15 degree of dead rise, does that sound correct?Thanks,Chaz"
524998,Guest,2002-10-19 20:30:00,0,I am not sure about the deadrise the dealer I was talking to was not sure what it was. He is contacting the factory to find out. JimW
525000,McQ,2002-10-21 13:23:00,615,"No I'm not the saleman, but I wanted to be sure of the information passed along so I called the plant in Princeville Quebec today to get the dead rise degrees on all the hulls being sold in the States. With any luck engineering will send me the info tomorrow and I will be able to post it here. Just so everyone is aware I have been using their boats for almost 20 years now and I get a new model every year or so. The last backtroller model I had was by far the fishingest one I've used yet. I will be getting into the 18' BT this year - problem up here in Canada is it's only rated for a 75 while you guys in the States can run a 90."
525001,McQ,2002-10-21 13:39:00,615,I no sooner posted the message when the factory fax came in. To confirm the deadrise on the 174 - it is 15 degrees.
525002,Guest,2002-10-21 15:06:00,0,Thanks for the info on the degrees of the Pro174. Did they tell you the degrees on the Pro 166?JimW
525003,Chaz,2002-10-21 15:21:00,46,"Jim,I was in a Pro 166 at Brown's Marina in Crosby, Ontario 2 weeks past and that model also has the Ultra Vee hull and it looked deep so I would say yes, 15 degrees.Chaz"
