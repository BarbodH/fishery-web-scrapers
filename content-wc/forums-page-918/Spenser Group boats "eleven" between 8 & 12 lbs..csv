These are the ones that the group landed & released. They also dropped their share of big fish during this past week. Then again, anyone who has spent any time fishing for big 'eyes knows the feeling of dropping big ones. Lord knows, I've dropped more than my share over the years! I suspect that I will drop a few more in the future, no biggy!On this the final day for the Spenser group, the lucky, but hard working lady in this party landed a 12, a 10, an 8 and a 6 lb. plus.No doubt she was the envey of the group, then again so she should be!! The bottom line is this, although the Red has been much, much slower than what we've grown accustom too, she still has plenty of magic left for those that are willing to grind it out. Even the Spenser five will admit that it was tougher this year than any previous, but I think that they sum it up better than most by saying, ""eleven trophy 'eyes in six days, ""not bad"", sure beats the ##### out of work!Lord I hope that it don't snow tomorrow, I hate fishing in wind and snow!"

525059,Walleye Wacker,2002-10-20 10:09:00,6,What part of the Red did all these nice fish come out of ? North of the border or South ?

Only 4 of the them were greenbacks....still lots of fun to get out on a nice day with no wind! Talked to others and they pretty much had the same ratio of walleye to sauger.Morning temps were -13C.....poor livewell pump was frozen, never got above -1C while we were out there.Pink Jigs and Salted minnows were the ticket today."
525062,Guest,2002-10-21 19:33:00,0,"I was out for the afternoon on Sunday the 20th also. Fished the following areas with no success....Sugar Island/seaplane base, north of new bridge, Doc Reeds, bouy 38, and Dubois Marine. Gave the exact same presentation a working over in an area just south of the power lines near the steam plant, and caught 10 greenbacks and one sauger. All were caught in an area about 50 feet long, drifting a purple and white jighead with TWO salted minnows. Brought home 4 NICE eaters and released a 28.25"", a 26"" a 24.5"" and a 23"". Had similar luck in the same area around this time last year. Has the increased flow from the dam opening finally turned these fish on????"
