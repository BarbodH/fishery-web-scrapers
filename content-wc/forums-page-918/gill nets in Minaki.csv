While trolling for muskies, 3 of the 4 boats in our group snagged into gill nets where the Winnipeg river meets Gunn lake near the bridge in Minaki and south to Cache point. They were identified by ribbons tied to trees, no float markers. These were operations with several boats unloading nets to trucks on shore. We encountered a total of 10 nets and started asking around. We got all types of replies from ""pull the nets up on shore"" to ""cut 'em loose"" to the natives have license to net for Whitefish. We just want to know if anyone has a solid answer to the type of netting that is allowed on this system.Anyone know what's going on?"
524958,Guest,2002-10-17 10:15:00,0,"Well, gill netting has been happening up there for as long as I've been going up there, and it hasn't just been the natives. They are netting for whitefish. When I was a kid (about twenty years ago) I went out with on of the fisherman to check his gill nets (this was up on Big Sand). Not only did he catch whitefish but I remember many many many many big pike/musky/walleye being netted as well. That system has suffored greatly from this practice over the years. I'm sure there is still a ""legal"" commercial whitefish operation going on but I'm not sure how ""legal"" the native thing is. I know for a fact that one of these commercial fisherman was fishing that system no less than about three years ago because I ran into him unloading his catch of whitefish at the Pistol Lake access site, this was the same guy who I went out with twenty years ago.I wouldn't listen to the local's (lodge owners) up there as they will fill you full of BS and tell you it isn't going on."

524960,Guest,2002-10-18 06:15:00,0,"Walleye fishing was slow. No problem finding fish, although tight schools of fish were scarce. We managed 4 shore lunches for our 4 boats and brought a few home. Big walleye of the trip was a fat 26"" 6-lber. The fish were taken on Lindy rigs & Fuzz-E grubs and minnows. A few were taken on 3-way rigs trolling stick baits but that was very slow compared to past years. The better walleyes were coming out of Gunn lake around potato Is. and on the south side of Big Is.We had fair muskie action but only 4 fish measured over 40"" with a 46"" hybrid as the big fish of the trip.After a dozen years on this system, we are reconsidering our plans for next year after seeing the amount of netting going on."
