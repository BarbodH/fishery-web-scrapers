524636,Guest,2002-09-29 17:28:00,0,I currently live in Winnipeg and found a new 2000 pro v 1800 IFS in alberta. Now when I pick this up the dealer said he would only charge me 7% gst tax. Now when I bring this back will I only have to pay pst on the trailer?
524637,Guest,2002-09-30 16:16:00,0,"Hi Dwayne,I am not familiar with Manitoba PST legislation. In Ontario I can tell you that the PST on the trailer is due upon registering or plating the trailer. (Unless you can show proof you have already paid the PST ie Sales Agreement). The boat is federally registered so it technically does not require PST to be paid. However, when I registered a used boat I received a letter in the mail from the Ontario Governement asking for a self assessment on the value of the boat. A friend of mine got caught on a used boat he bought and sold in BC. He got caught when he sold it.x(I would think Manitoba would not let you get away without paying the PST on the whole package. It would just be in two installments.;-) x("
524638,Thumper,2002-09-30 19:31:00,133,You used to be able to get away with this. Now the provinces will collect the tax and remit it to where the owner resides. I went through this with Ontario and Manitoba this year on a boat purchase
524639,Guest,2002-10-08 19:04:00,0,You guys are talking about Ontario an BC I will be buying from alberta. They do not charge pst there at all. So I'm thinking how are they going to find out? In other provences where they charge pst the dealer would have to sudmit this. No reason to do this in Alberta.
524640,Peanut,2002-10-09 09:37:00,929,"The law is that you are obligated to self-assess for PST on both the boat and trailer. I'm from Saskatchewan, the taxation capital of North America. Needless to say, many purchases are made in Alberta by our fine residents. When you go to register (plate) your trailer, it will show up on Manioba's system as not having PST paid on it, and you will be charged PST for the value of the trailer at the time you buy your plates.As for the boat, plating your trailer will likely also raise a red flag in the system, as very few boat trailers are purchased without boats sitting on them too. So, you can expect to be asked then or shortly after if a boat also came with the trailer, and if so, you will be asked to declare its value and remit the appropriate amount of tax. There is a big difference in terms of how you'll be treated between saying nothing and claiming ignorance and not answering a question truthfully - it is an offence to lie to the taxing authorities. Speaking purely hypothetically, if one was to buy a boat out of province, and tow it on a trailer already registered in his home province, it would be more difficult for the taxing authorities to discover the purchase of the boat. But, that does not make it legal - you have to decide on whether the risk is worth it. Also, if you're like SK, the insurer is also gov't-owned, so when you add the boat to your policy, and if its serial number gets run for whatever reason, guess what might be discovered?

524641,boat nut,2002-10-10 07:58:00,1146,"Peanut's right of course. However, you may notice that your trailer is registered as a ""utility trailer"" and as such , no one but you will know what cargo it carries."
524642,Guest,2002-10-10 11:01:00,0,"The way the Provincial Governments find out is when you register the boat it is with the Federal Government. The Provinces and the Feds are now talking to each other on these matters. If you register the boat and use an address in MB, you can be sure the MB government will be asking you to do a self assessment and to send a cheque. That is how they got me in ON.If you were an AB resident buying in MB, than you would probably look for a refund from the MB government, because AB does not charge PST.Peanut is right about the ""place of use"" rules. It does exist, it just does not usually set of any red flags. Registering your boat with an MB address that was originally titled in AB will.Worst thing that could happen is you will have to pay PST on the whole package, just like you would if you bought it in MB. Its your decision.;)"
524643,Guest,2002-10-14 17:05:00,0,Thanks guys. I bought the boat and I got a bill of sale for the trailer seperate from the boat. I will post if anything happens.
