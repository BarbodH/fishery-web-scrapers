522941,Guest,2002-07-26 19:49:00,0,Going next friday to Totem.
522942,csm,2002-07-27 12:45:00,0,"Was just up there last week. Fishing was only so-so and it really depended on the guide we had. The best days we had on the water we with two guides, both named Dean. We were with a big party and we could switch guides at mid-day. The other guides seemed more interested in driving the boat than fishing. Perhaps it was just the luck of the day, but we heard that from other people as well.Walleyes we got were pretty small, nothing in our boat over 20"" in three days. Smallmouth fishing was much better, more numerous and several over 15"", and much, much closer to the resort. Was at Lac Seul the month before and that was outstanding.Good luck"
522943,Guest,2002-07-28 08:35:00,0,"csm, thanks for the report. I'm leaving next Friday and can't wait. What was the program for smallies. Never fished there before, so I appreciate all the advice I can get. Staying at Red Indian. Thanks."
522944,csm,2002-07-28 14:56:00,0,"For the smallies, find boulder reefs/humps,and cast cranks, jigs or just go with a leach. The latter is terrific if you have kids or a spouce that is not an expereince fisherman. Small circle hook, a BB/split shot weight about 16 inches above the hook and then use a medum sized leach. The samllies go crazy on a leach and if there is one close by, they will hit it. The cranks and the tube jigs are less certain, but you get bigger fish.Finding the humps is no problem. If you don't know the ones not on the maps, then just find the bouys and they often mark a reef. Also, check out any ""micro island"" that is just a few weeds and sticks sticking up in the middle of no-where. The lake level was up about 3 feet so the those were good inidication of a reef or a hump just below the surface. In the morning, if its real calm. cast surfact lures around down trees and shoreline boulders. A yellow Jitterbug (1 1/2"") works great as does a black one.Good luck. The smallies fight harder than the walleyes so they are a great time. Just think if smallies got to the same size as walleyes...csm"

522946,WillieB,2002-07-29 08:39:00,292,"UNDERCOVER OPERATION RESULTS IN $17,000 FINES AGAINST LODGE AND RESORT OWNER Tuesday, May 28, 2002 by Mark Lamb KENORA Â— A Sioux Narrows tourist resort owner and lodge have been convicted, in two separate trials, of having a large number of walleye over the limit. Eric Brown, 49, of Sioux Narrows, and Totem Lodge of Sioux Narrows Limited have been fined $17,000. Brown and Totem Lodge were fined $1,000 on May 15 for an over-possession of walleye, which happened at the lodge in June 1998. The guide involved in the operation had already been convicted and sentenced. On May 16, Brown was fined $5,000 and Totem Lodge was fined $10,000 for having 49 walleye over the limit at the lodge and at Brown's residence in June 1998. The convictions and sentencing end an undercover operation conducted by the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) on Lake of the Woods in 1998. Justice of the Peace Gordon Buterin took into account the amount of walleye, the commercial connection of the offence and the need for deterrence in arriving at the sentences. The public is asked to protect its natural resources by reporting violations to any MNR office or by calling Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477). From the Kenora Paper."
522947,dlhomes,2002-07-30 17:31:00,62,"Just got back last night. Fishing was slow and no size ATALL!! Real diappointed w/ size. Caught enough then tried to find NEW spots with out much luck. Weather cooled down and fishing did too!! Friend did get a 28"" in Regina Bay. Real curious on the Totem boats. I see them everywhere and thought they usally did pretty good. I know they'll do all they can to run other boats out of their spots! Do they just anchor on a spot and you throw your jig out? Don't seem to see them move around much on a spot. The best area for smallmouth would probably be back in Lobstick Bay. Most guys just fish the shores/ islands etc. with cranks or spinners and get lots of smallies and some eyes. I don't know the story behind Totems owner and his fines but I think he tries to run a nice operation, has paid his fines and is probably trying to forget about it- but some people can't forgive and forget!Whatever."
522948,WillieB,2002-07-30 18:52:00,292,I'm sure he's either paid his fines or is appealing. I'm sure he tries to run a nice operation and wants to just move on.As far as the forgive and forget part...I'm not passing judgement here. The article on the trial was posted in the Kenora paper on May 28th...2 months ago. Forgive me for thinking that it may be current and pertinent information for someone who was headed there.
522949,csm,2002-07-31 16:02:00,0,"The owner of Totem seems like a nice guy, we were up in mid-July, and its a nice resort. As to what the Totem boats do, remember, there are three Totem resorts and as such, lots of guests and lots of guides. With lots comes more variablity. As I said in my previous report, we had a couple of terrific guides and then a couple of, well, less terrific guides. It seems like they all run a similar program, find a hump, put a marker buoy on it and then very slowly vertical jig the spot. The two good guides were courtious of other boats and did not run near them and even moved away a bit when traveling at high speed. The other two, well, they did seem to run pretty close at high speed. When fishing, they all seem to do the same thing for walleye 1/4 oz jig, no body, and a leach. I was surpised at the smallness of the jig given that we fished in about 25 - 28 feet of water and also they did not want any body on the jig.The best line I heard was with one of less steller guides. We traveled for about an hour to go fishing, we arrived and he told me to put on minnow, then put the minnows over the side (they were in a bait bucket). I told him they were all dead and was it OK to use a dead minnow. His line, was to put the bait bucket in the water and that they would revive themselves. Needless to say, this was the start of the day and it went down hill from there.As to the resort, its clean, the chows good, and like I said, fishing is fishing so you never know what is going to happen."
522950,dlhomes,2002-08-04 05:15:00,62,Thanks for the info csm. I'm heading up again around Labor Day for 5 full days of fishing! As always will be on the lookout fot Totem boats. We had the smorgasboard at Totem and was good(but pricy$28) .I met Corky one of Totem guides last year and he was really informative and seemed very nice. Imagine it's a long day if you get stuck with a dick. Also have heard onwers a decent guy and surprised he would do something so stupid?? Also get good info from John? at the Last Resort. Have never heard of dancing girls at his place however!
