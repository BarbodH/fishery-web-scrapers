554220,Guest,2006-01-30 18:59:00,0,Looking for a good drive in camp/lodge for lake trout in ontario. Will cross the border at fortfrances. Housekeeping and will probably take my own boat.Thanks
554222,Guest,2006-01-30 19:18:00,0,"There are certainly options available. A good drive-to place, just northeast of Ear Falls, is South Bay Lodge. It's actually, technically a boat-in, but they come and pick you up and take you over to the lodge . . . it's only about 10 minutes. Good lake trout fishing, particularly early in the year until early-mid July. They also have good big-pike fishing available. In the spring, you can catch big pike and lakers in the same locations, throwing the same stuff, it's awesome!! And probably the best thing about that place is they have good opportunities for lakers, pike, and wallies. Most places tend to offer either mainly lake trout fishing or mainly walleye fishing (pike seem to be everywhere), but at South Bay Lodge you can have the best of both worlds. Laker Taker"
554232,Guest,2006-01-31 08:19:00,0,"I too have been to South Bay Lodge and agree that the Laker fishing in the spring is just fantastic! You can cast spoons or plugs near the river mouths and catch Big Pike and Lake trout all day. Walleye are on the many portage lakes around where they have boats cashed. All and all it is a great multi species place, i would definately recommend it. Its just a short 5 minute boat ride into the place but this means that it is more secluded than other lakes which is always nice. Good Luck in 2006 Everyone! Bill Thoms"
