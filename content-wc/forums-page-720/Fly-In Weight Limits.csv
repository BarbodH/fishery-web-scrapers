Just curious how you guys that fly-in deal with 80# or 100# per person weight limits. Sometimes I think overload fees are ways some outfitters take advantage of making a few extra bucks. I know some outfitters will bring part of your overload in on a mid-week flight, but others don't offer that option. How do you keep your weights down? Do you take all dried goods for food to save weight? Beer is the biggest culpret, a case of 30 cans weighs about 25 # although most outfitters will fly your beer in ahead of time as long as you purchase it from them at their rate. How do you manage tackle, food, beverages, electronics, clothes, etc? Any suggestions on how to ""stay light""? Did a site search here, but didn't come up with anything really helpful. Thanks Larry"
554210,Guest,2006-01-30 13:40:00,0,"Larry: You are right, it's tough to do. Especially with beer. Here's a few things we did to try to cut down on weight. Bedding- no sleeping bags, just a sheet, pillow cases and a blanket. Check, they may even supply extra blankets and pillows. We figured if we got cold, we'd burn a little wood. Clothes- I've learned over the years that you rarely use all the stuff you bring on a fly in. Does anyone really use a fresh entire set of clothes daily on a fly-in? 2 changes for the week, one fresh change for the trip home....undies and socks daily. One set of Rain Gear. Clothes that layer well rather than a bulky, heavy coat. Incidentals- make sure 6 guys don't all bring dish soap, toothpaste, etc. Heavy Batteries- You're going to fishing paradise, do you really need electronics to catch some fish and have fun? Minimize your gear as much as possible. Beer, now that's a tough one. First and always, cans, no bottles. How about mixed drinks as opposed to beer? Food- Organization here is the key. We eat like Kings on our trips, part of the joy of the whole trip. We plan for 3 fish frys during the week, they're light ( can of shortning, flour, bread crumbs and FRESH fish). The other meals need to be laid out in advance so that , again, three guys don't each bring 5#s of Taters.....3 Ketchups...etc. The other thing we do is freeze milk for cooling purposes for the trip in, and use it up as it thaws. We also freeze up main dishes for dinner...like a smoked pork BBQ -w- sauce, all cooked, frozen...again provides cold for the trip up and gets used when it thaws. Spaghetti sauce works well too. In either case, all you need is some bread and salad -in -a-bag and you're set. All small things in and of themselves, but it all adds up!"
554213,jigman 2003,2006-01-30 15:17:00,981,"Here's my solution: use Mattice Lake Outfitters. They do not weigh your stuff. As long as you aren't bringing in a keg of beer, they find a way to get your stuff in to you without an over weight charge. They have to bring some heavier items in on a flight later in the day, but that is usually no big deal. Just make sure your fishing gear, some clothes and at least one case of beer go in on the first flight. They allow a liberal 150 lbs. as it is, but if you are over a bit they don't nail you. Used them for a number of years now and have not seen them use the scale. It is there and I suppose if a group were piggish they would use it, but most folks figure it out."

554225,Pooch,2006-01-30 22:42:00,4619,"One outfitter we use allows 150# per person and the other is 100#. For the 150# trip each guy gives 50# for bait, food and other ""community"" supplies. Leaving 100# for tackle and clothing. One guy does all of the groceries and bait. No duplications to speak of. Each guy also brings thier own junk food. Even at 150# per person you can't take along a big bunch of beer or soft drinks. On the 100# trip it is the about same thing and we just have to eat the overweight charges. Like the above post stated. Clean undies every day, clean tee shirt every couple of days and a pair of jeans last all week unless you hit a wet week. Shower and deoderant keeps everyone tolorable for a week or two. (Most of the time.....) We eat quite well but don't take a big bunch of steaks or other frozen meats. Usually precook and freeze hamburger for spagetti and sloppy joes. If your careful and plan ahead when picking up supplies you can eat pretty high on the hog without toting in a bunch of weight. We eat two meals a day and sometimes have popcorn, a sandwich or instant soups when we get in at night. All of us drink beer but decided that we are there to fish and can drink beer when we get home. So we don't take much beer or soft drinks. Coffee and sun tea seem to be the drinks of choice anymore. Some guys like crystal lite mixes. No powdered milk for us though! (We do have a little pride left in our old age.) I used to have a packing list some where but can't put my hands on it right now. Pooch"

554227,beagle22b07,2006-01-31 07:31:00,34,"Good advice guys. Baxter, you are so right on the clothes. It seems we never wear 1/2 the clothes you take, although one year at the Gouin in late July a cold front came through and the temps dropped into the upper 30's / lower 40's for a day. That year I think I had every piece of clothing in the bag on. Good rain gear is an absolute must. That year, it helped cut the wind after the cold front went through. I found that those neoprene gloves are great too. Jigman & Hawk, good to know the outfitters that are liberal on their weights. You could spent a whole season looking at web sites trying to figure out who has what weight restrictions. I think that weight limits should be based on total weights for the aircraft. One year we got charged an overweight fee even though everyone was within their limits because when you took the baggage and body weights, we were over weight. We had a couple guys in the 250# class. Nobody want an outfitter to fly an overloaded aircraft, but I think that there is a lot of ""grey area"" on weight limits. Has anyone ever been charged an overload fee only to have the overload placed on the same plane they are flying in on? We have. The outfitter says that he always reserves some weight for himself in case he has to take someting in to the camp, like propane, an extra boat motor, etc. I just don't think that is the proper way to treat your customers. Once again, it's good to know that Mattice Lake and Kenora Air don't practice that. Pooch, we do take crystal light. Do you have any favorite flavors? We have found that the Ice Tea flavor is best because it matches the stained water color the best. I remember taking Tang one year, yuck, didn't mix well with the water at all. Real bad taste. Do you guys boil lake water or use purification tablets? We use the frozen water packs used to keep the food cold on the trip, but they usually last to mid-week then we're out. Keep posting guys. Lots of good info so far. I think there are more guys with this problem that you think. Larry"
554242,Guest,2006-01-31 12:33:00,0,"I remember flying out one year and the back foot of the pontoons was under water. When that happens, don't ask the pilot how long he's been flying even if he looks like he's not old enought to vote. You always get some smart remark that never makes you feel any better. The flyin service that we use has the sign ""Tipping your pilot helps him remember where he left you"" for everyone to see. Everybody's funny, now you funny too!"
554246,Guest,2006-01-31 12:55:00,0,"Agree with everything you said except the batteries. I can not see going on a fly-in without my depth finder and a couple of batteries. Secret there is put the big lantern batteries in your jacket pocket so that they don't get weighed. along the same line, my brother's trick is to wear all of his heaviest clothes on the way in to save 5 or ten pounds. Sometimes he looks like the Michelin man, but it works. By the way, we both way about 165, so we figure this would not lead to a plane overload."

We had myself (235 lbs), my bro-inlaw (275), my buddy Ryan (300+), and Joel (250+). No, we're not all fat. All ex-ball players. Well, I may be 20 pounds heavy. ;) Anyway, Kenora Air typically will fly stuff in for you ahead of time if you request it. We are having beer and drinking water flown in ahead of time. She takes care of potatoes and staples as part of your package price. We pack light, but we have to take 2 planes because we have 10 guys. I think we took a beach and otter last year. No problems on weight. We all got on the scale with our gear....quite a site!"
554267,Guest,2006-02-01 07:25:00,0,"I was just thinking back on my groups first fly-in trip. We were younger then and alot more foolish....had to have PLENTY of beer. The outfitter had a huge scale, and we were instructed to put all our stuff on it to weigh in. So we loaded all our stuff. There were 8 of us with a 100#/person limit. We were able to fit all our gear on there....and the needle on the scale pegged out Exactly at 800#s. Sadly, our many cases of brew still sat on the ground....off the scale. You could have heard a pin drop....till my Buddy Dean said ""Oh !#$%&!....well, I guess I really don't need those clothes."" As it worked out, the outfitter ( Air Melancon in Quebec...highly recommended) flew our beer in later that day with no additional charge. Classic moment for my group, we still laugh about it."
554228,Whopper,2006-01-31 07:45:00,340,"Larry, we use an outfitters out of the Armstrong area that fly's to five different lakes called Armstong Outpost and Air Charter Service and they don't ever charge us for overweight. Although I've only gone a couple of years, the group I go with has been going since 1991. They always make sure we have what we need and bring the rest either the next day of at midweek check, and yes we all drink beer and that has never been a problem. Whopper"
554229,jigman 2003,2006-01-31 07:45:00,981,"On your water question: I have been taking a Brita water filter pitcher for about 5 years now. It takes out the bad taste and the ""stain"" of the water. The thing is really pretty amazing. I do not know if it will remove Giardia, it states that it will but don't know for sure. I know none of us have ever gotten it."
554233,jigman 2003,2006-01-31 08:23:00,981,Another option some outfitters provide is to fly your beer and pop in before you get there. They use a check flight to do so. Of course that means you need to buy your beer and pop from them.
