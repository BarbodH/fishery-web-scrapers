554117,Guest,2006-01-26 11:12:00,0,Why go to Vaughn from Sioux Lookout???? You will be boating over and by thousands of Walleye. Besides that Vaughn can have decent fishing but it is not any better or as good as many areas close to Sioux Lookout.
554183,Guest,2006-01-28 14:27:00,0,hey why- i just started fishing that end and really don't know it very well. only twice. put in once at deception landing and once at hudson and fished lost lake area. could you give up some spots from either of those two locations? thanks! scar
554188,Guest,2006-01-29 09:07:00,0,"If you're coming from Hudson/Deception, you need to go through Manitou rapids and head west , past Manitou light ( on your left) -keep going west through "" Devil's Elbow"" then head southwest , curving west again, and then NW to access Vaughn Lake. It's a good distance ( 20-25 miles) from either of those put ins. I always head north from ""Devils Elbow"" ( or through "" The Rags"" if the water is up) and fish the Bear Narrows > MaCleans Narrows area . Just fish the windward sides of island and shoreline points - locate the fish on your electronics at the depth they are using - and vertical jig . jbp"
