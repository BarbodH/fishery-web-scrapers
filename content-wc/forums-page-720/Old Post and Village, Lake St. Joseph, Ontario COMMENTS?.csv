554259,pfg1,2006-01-31 19:02:00,52,"My 13yr old son and I are planning a drive-to fishing trip in July 2006. My son is after northern pike in the 35-45"" range or bigger. He does not yet have the patience for eyes. One strong contender is the Old Post and Village on Lake St. Joseph, Ontario. Any better ideas? Your comments and suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks, DAVID & DAVID, Cedarburg, WI, USA"
