554195,Dr. Lee,2006-01-29 19:29:00,15,"I need information on Long Legged Lake Resort west of Ear Falls, NW Ontario. Specifically, I have a non-detailed map which shows a series of lakes in the system, all of which are advertised as accessible. I also notice on the map a reference to a couple of ""lifts."" I am uncertain about what that means. Also, on an early post about this camp, there was a reference to ""not being able to get throught the narrows to get to the south lakes."" I am very curious about that commment. Also, how is the walleye fishing? The condition of the camp? If you do have information on this lake/camp, I would be very grateful for some help. Thanks in advance!"
