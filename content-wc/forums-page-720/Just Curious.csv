554133,Guest,2006-01-26 21:46:00,0,"Don't know if the Queen puts out any money from DEEP pockets but I would bet a beer that she gets a cut of Canadian money. (I bet I owe someone a beer now.) My mother on the other hand is from Scotland and still holds her citizen ship in Scotland. She and aunt and uncles don't think much of the queen, my younger cousins 30-40 years can't stand the money grabbing queen. Good thing she not up to vote on! She is a #### rich lady by the way of others pockets. As far as saying you are from GB they will say Scotland not GB. Makes them sound likethey are part of England. Mom tells me it is like this... Tell everyone you are from North America??? So are you US or Canadian. If you are US you want people to know you are US if you are Canadian you want people to know that, not just North American or Great B. Gets crazy"
554143,Dave Q,2006-01-27 08:23:00,1003,I agree very much with Larry S.- Scary guy. m.h.o.
553929,Shellback,2006-01-20 18:10:00,8083,"I was wondering, is Canada considered a British colony and if so, can folks from say England and Canada move at will between countries? Seems a shame now how Americans and Canadiens have all the border fuss traveling to and from each others country. I'm a first generation American with my folks coming from Scotland and Ireland. Many of their families also settled in Canada and as a youngster we often traveled up to see them. Been along time ago, 50's and 60's but I don't remember much of a border check point or whatever."
553937,Guest,2006-01-21 00:29:00,0,A British Colony? Are you kidding? I guess you weren't watching CNN when we got our independence . . . it was only 138 years ago!
553992,troutaholic,2006-01-24 08:54:00,827,Lol....138 years ago....wasn't Dick Clark doing the CNN reporting at that time? I think that was before his stint on American Bandstand... Just Rip Lips and Keep a Tight Line
553998,Guest,2006-01-24 12:18:00,0,"To get more information on Canada's Independence you can go towww.iamadumbamerican.com You can also get answers to ""Do they celebrate the Fourth of July like we do in the us?"" and also ""Is Christmas in Canada the same as in the US?"""
553999,rockpt,2006-01-24 14:06:00,589,"That's pretty funny. It is curious though why Queen Elizabeth is Canada's lawful head of state and the Canadian Royal Anthem is ""God Save the Queen"". Moreover, to become a Canadian citizen one has to swear an oath of allegiance to the Queen. So, it's not such a stretch for someone to think Canada is still a colony of or somehow dependent on Great Britain. Of course, Canada is independent but also is a constitutional monarchy, a totally foreign concept to most Americans. Anyway, I think it was a sincere question, if a little naive."
554002,Guest,2006-01-24 14:58:00,0,"That site is funny because it is true. A whole sector of comedy has been developed around how naive Americans are to Canadian facts. It relates right back to the American culture. On the whole, the same is not true of Canadian knowledge of the United States, which granted, is likely largely attributable to the high presence of American media in Canada. NWO Fishing Bum"
554007,Skylane,2006-01-24 18:45:00,101,"My Canadian neighbor (originally from Prince Edward Island) told us she had to learn the states and their capitols when she was in school. How many Americans can even name all the provinces? On a side note, I am happy for all Canadians on the outcome of the election on Monday. I hope this is just the start of good things to come. Hopefully both sides will learn to play together nice."
554008,Guest,2006-01-24 19:27:00,0,"We all have our share of politically and geographically challenged people. We can travel at will to British Colonies and Britian but it's always a good idea to have the passport. The Maple Leaf is well respected..allas the Bin Ladens of the world know this as well. I'm glad to see you people are looking at the identity card thing for visits to Canada rather than the passport. We have had a good relationship for many years but like a marriage a little ""tune up"" can be good for the complexion."
