554278,Guest,2006-02-01 12:53:00,0,I cross the border into Canada at Intl. Falls. What is being required in 2006 going in both directions? Is a drivers license still good enough or do you need birth certificate or passport? The Customs gentleman I talked to coming back into the States last Fall said a minimum of a birth certificate would probably be required. Passports take time to get & cost money $75 to $90 I heard. If anyone can assist with this question it would be greatly appreciated.
