554164,ONE TIME DAVE,2006-01-27 14:19:00,110,"As I said in a previous post try Arctic Watershed Outposts out of Nakina. Makoki and Wayner lakes, small and ideal for 2 people. Great fishing on both. Will do less than a week. Look at www.awonakina.com. Remi and Christine the owners will be in Ohio next week so be patient if trying to call. Have maps available on all their lakes. Have fished many and can give first hand info. Contact [email protected]"
554168,kbkakes,2006-01-27 14:58:00,49,"Blueranger If you want to drive as far as Ear Falls I have to recommend the Lake I was at with my sons in 2002. Check out Sumach Lake W/Excelent Adventures outposts. Is only a 20 min flight and the lake is great for Walleye. Nonstop pike. Lake also has lake trout, smallies and perch. Also great host. Faron and Joyce Bukler. Good Luck....Kevin Mhttp://www.exc-adventures.com/index.htm"

554054,Schief79,2006-01-25 20:00:00,11,"We booked with Big Hook last June and flew in to West Lake outpost and had a great trip. They supplied most of the staple foods and plenty of it. Cabins clean and comfortable. Fishing was great as you had basically 2 lakes to fish and waterfalls. We caught all the fish we wanted to. (Walleye and Northern) Once we got to their base, then they flew us 55 minutes to a land base and then they transferred us by a van to float plane and it was a 22 minute flight to the cabin. We go to a different Outfitter/Lake every year and this June it is with Pickle Lake. Hope this helps. Chief"

Many outfitters would take a party of two, but they would charge a lot more. The outfitter I found that would take us for only about $25 more was Mattice Lake Outfitters. That was 6 or 7 years ago, and I will be going with them again this year. Great people, great fishing, great accomodations. If you are looking for a more affordable option for the two of you, you should state what province, area, time of year, etc. There are a lot of drive in camps out there. Some are good, some are not. Get references from people that have been there before you go anywhere."
