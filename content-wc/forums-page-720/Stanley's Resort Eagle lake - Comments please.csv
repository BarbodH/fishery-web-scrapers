553947,Guest,2006-01-21 13:16:00,0,Havent stayed at stanleys but seen it from the water last year while at eagle lake. Did try to drive to it but it seemed a long drive from the highway.so we turned around. Looks like a high class resort. Close to the trout holes. Larry

Your trip would be a great experience if you chose this camp. He has top notch equipment and guides that know the lake very well. We watch them bring in fish from the deck of our cabin so we know the guides know where they are biting."
553997,Guest,2006-01-24 10:50:00,0,Our group has gone to the West Arm of Eagle since 1977...Stanley's is a great place. Lots of water to learn...fishing spots as well as reefs. We've had good luck on Eagle but better on the portage lakes that Stanley's has boats on. We'll be there June 2nd for a week. Give it a try.
554248,Crappie Kid,2006-01-31 14:31:00,1581,I have finally booked a week at Stanleys. Actually I booked a couple of different weeks and had to change twice because of conflicting schedules. The resort owner was very gracious and flexible when it came to rebooking. My first Canada trip with my 2 adult sons... I cannot wait!
