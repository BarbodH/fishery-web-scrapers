Driving violations like DUI's (which this thread is about) ARE on your license. That is how the border crossing patrol determines if you have a DUI. Pretty simple. Not mis-information.
554160,Guest,2006-01-27 13:08:00,0,"They are not attached to your license. I am a Detective and run DL's all the time. They do not show DUI's unless you are currently suspended. They are not running your DL to see if it is valid, they check you at the border for criminal charges. Either way, dumb advise."
554176,jigman 2003,2006-01-27 21:10:00,981,"Okay detective Dave, you win. I run a lot of people on my state's criminal records website, and you are right, I don't need their driver's license only their name. Birthdate helps narrow it down, but it isn't necessary. Soooo, you're right, stupid advice. I humbly withdraw my previous statements. As someone without any DUI's on my record I really don't need to worry about this, but it seemed to make sense when the outfitter mentioned it. I guess the best way to deal with this is not to drive drunk. If you are that stupid, then I guess you deserve to have to pay the $200 to get into Canada. I think in most European countries you lose your license for life on the first DUI."
554186,Guest,2006-01-29 07:56:00,0,"A buddy of mine was arrested for DUI and went to court. The case was dismissed. Thus, he has no conviction. Last year his ID was checked at the border, I think they check with NCIC National Crime Info Center. The arrest showed up and he had to tell them the whole story. They let him in but he still had to pay the $200.00 So when it comes to entering Canada an arrest means the same as a conviction."
554190,Guest,2006-01-29 14:41:00,0,"That is unfortunately how the computer systems in some states work. In Indiana, you do not show a criminal history until you are convicted. In Illinois, the minute you are arrested, they show an arrest in the computer, and will also show if you are convicted. Over the border they probably do not know how to read that properly. If he was found not guilty he can petition the state to remove the DUI from his CQH."
554193,Guest,2006-01-29 18:23:00,0,He tells me the NCIC system is run by the old FBI and the only way the arrest can be removed is by a pardon from the Pres or the Governor. Anyway thats what he tells me.

554118,jigman 2003,2006-01-26 11:29:00,981,"In talking with an outfitter at the All Canada show about passports being required by the U.S. he brought up a good point; if someone has a DUI it shows up when you give them your driver's license. It does not show up when you hand them your passport. Therefore, getting one would be a good way around the hassle of filling out forms and paying for entry. Just an idea."
554123,Guest,2006-01-26 17:26:00,0,"And risk getting caught and getting sent back home and not getting to fish. Dumb idea. Pay the $200 and go without the worries. If you are flying into Canada, you name is on the plane manifest and your name will be run no matter what ID you present."
554132,Guest,2006-01-26 21:45:00,0,i always down a few on the way up from chicago.. that way when i get to the border buzzed it's obvious i can handle my vehicle while im impaired. any other issues are taken care of with a 50 spot in the ash tray. pay backs a beeoch hey chub??
554142,jigman 2003,2006-01-27 07:36:00,981,"Flying into Canada is a different issue. I was referring to handing the border crossing people your passport while driving in. As long as your passport is valid, they will not ask for your driver's license."
554145,Guest,2006-01-27 09:05:00,0,"Criminal records are not attatched to your Driver's License and that is what they are looking for. They show up when your name and dob are run. Whether you hand them a DL or a Passport, they will have your name and DL. Nice bit of mis-information though. Either way it is a DUMB DUMB DUMB idea. I personally look forward to my Canada trips months ahead of time. I would hate to plan everything, prepare everything, and then get turned away at the border because some guy in my party did not take care of his DUI obligations. $200 is not a lot of money to get this done inadvance."
537270,natelarge,2004-02-09 19:21:00,1,"I understand that Canada does not allow people with a DUI on their to enter the country. However, I heard there is a form you can fill out which would allow entry. Does anyone know where to get a form like that?"

537282,bigfish1965,2004-02-10 08:26:00,3210,I know I'm going to be a lot more careful driving in the states from now on!
537284,retire55,2004-02-10 09:12:00,1029,"bigfish1965: Took a look at your gallery of pictures - some great fish caught. Unfortunately, the gallery doesn't indicate whether these wonderful specimens were harvested or released to protect the gene pool. I accept that whether fish are released or harvested is an individual decision. Its just that I could enjoy the pictures more if I knew most of these fish had been released."
537300,bigfish1965,2004-02-10 14:49:00,3210,retire55; All fish except the 15 pound eye were released. The big one was too injured (gill raker) to release.I wouldn't eat a fish over 3 pounds so these fatties are still swimmin! The 15 is on my wall.
537315,retire55,2004-02-10 21:25:00,1029,"bigfish: Outstanding!! I've never had the pleasure of catching a 15 lb walleye but I still look forward to the experience. Back in my early days, when I still lived in south western Ontario, we fished the western basin of Lake Erie (out of Colchester). I lost count of how many 10 lb + walleyes we released. We kept only what we called ""spikes"" (walleyes 14-16 inches) to eat. Eventually I settled and retired in eastern Ontario. Now I tend to walleye fish in Quebec lakes north of Ottawa. Biggest caught there (and released) has been 9 lbs."

537318,bigfish1965,2004-02-10 23:23:00,3210,AS you can tell by the pics I caught all those fish in the exact same spot. (Nice honey hole). The biggest I caught there was a 16. It really had twice the fight of the 15. Nearly 20 minute fight. Like wrestling a Lake Trout...bulldoggin along the bottom. Shoot me an email if you're ever in Niagara! We really are spoiled here aren't we :D
