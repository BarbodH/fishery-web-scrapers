3963249,Bassmandpe,2015-06-13 17:31:00,42,Any results in? Looks like the weather got warm.
3965698,redryder,2015-06-14 17:26:00,33,It's all over. I think the winning team this year has one it more than a couple of times.
3965866,Bassmandpe,2015-06-14 18:10:00,42,"Thanks Buddy, a friend of mine fished it but did not do too well. Tks again. Hope to hear from you next year!"
3967202,maddogg,2015-06-15 08:22:00,178,How many fish could a team register each day?
3968330,redryder,2015-06-15 12:59:00,33,"Four per day. I think one can be over 21"" and the other three under 18"". No livewells or stringers. Supposed to kill the fish you are planning on keeping."
3971098,Bassmandpe,2015-06-16 09:04:00,42,The no Culling feature makes it really difficult. Buddy who fished it said they had a couple fish over but did not keep them hoping to get bigger fish. You know the rest of the story. He said same two guys won the event for like the fifth or sixth year.
