3965602,packpro,2015-06-14 16:34:00,695,"18th year. Water level normal. This fishery just keeps getting better. Our group of 7 limited out on Walleyes after 30 minutes on the water. Had all of our overs, and most of the unders were just under. Bays were 65F ,main areas were 60F. Fish were stacked in 7-9 ft of water. Reefs, narrows, wind blown islands, inlets, current, and points all held fish. So many spots to fish. Most fish were overs in the 20""-22"" range. Plenty in the 24""-26"" range. Most of the bigger fish were on the portage lakes. Great numbers and bigger fish on those lakes. Big Pikes were 40.5 and 38"" 12.5 and 11.7 pounds. Bonus fish-lake trout. They taste so good when cooked fresh. Caught them trolling down to 13'. Probably the last week as they were headed to deeper water when we left. Smallies were pre-spawn, but not on the beds yet. Ledges and Rock rubble produced quite a few 16""-17"" fighters. Our group also caught a few 24""ish tiger muskies. No pictures as they we immediately released. Beautiful fish and bodes well for the future. Weather was perfect, cloudy with just enough wind for the ""walleye chop"" Last day was no wind and sunny. We still caught fish, but production was down on the same spots that were on fire earlier in the week. Meet NWwalleye in camp. Great guide, informative. Fun guy in camp, at the dock, and in the fish house. Gave our group a ""Y"" bone lesson. His clients should be very pleased as he produced great numbers of fish, and we never saw him on the water. Knows all the lakes in in the Vermillion Bay area. Perfect personality for his profession."

Lots of fun. willing to share spots and techniques, all while being someone you enjoy being with in the boat all day. We had the small mouth and the lake trout all shallow. Could wear a guys arms down. Glad to hear you had a great time too. 18 years. I'm jealous, been about 9 years over the last 15 for me. CH. put Big Canon on you calendar for next year, you won't regret it."
