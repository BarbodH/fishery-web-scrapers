3977386,Bassmandpe,2015-06-18 07:14:00,42,"Mark, for the first five years we stayed at Abrams Lake Park. We moved five years ago to Red Pine. Nice cabins and great people. Boats are much better too. Since it is far from Florida we can't tow our bass boats all that way. My email is [email protected]. Would appreciate any help."

3953745,Bassmandpe,2015-06-10 11:22:00,42,"Just got back from a week at Sioux Lookout. We caught Musky, Pike, Lake Trout, Smallmouth and Walleye. The weather warmed up as the week went on and the water level was good. The rocks that needed to be exposed were out of the water. Most all areas were accessable to our group. We fished the lakes around Sioux Lookout and Minnitaki Lake. Smallmouth fishing was slow even with the warmer wather. Needed probably another week to really go on fire. Fish we did get were on some top water but mostly crankbaits. We fish a lot of swimbaits here in Florida so we take them to Canada each year. The smaller ones seem to work the best. The Walleye were scattered once again this year. Did have plenty to eat and caught quite a few in the slot. The leeches were small so the minnows were a better bait. The big news of the trip was the burning down of Knobby's! That old wooden building went up fast. The smoke could be seen for many miles. Supposetly there were three people eating breakfast when the kitchen caught on fire. We like to eat at the Wellington and have found the food pretty good. Pizza is good at the small store attached to the Wellington. Fishing pressure was not heavy at all. The border crossing was normal into Canada but must say on the way back to the US the Customs Officer asked more questions than usual. Next trip is in late July to the White River area. Nice to get out of the Florida heat!"

3957985,Guest,2015-06-11 19:05:00,0,"Did you catch your musky in Minnitaki? We have not had one on there is 12 years now, and our camp does not mention muskies in their advertising. We are wondering if the lake has them."
3959665,Bassmandpe,2015-06-12 09:45:00,42,"Musky's came from Big Vermillion Lake. Last year one of our guys got a 43""."
3962193,RapShad,2015-06-13 10:05:00,76,Although rare there are Muskies in Lac Seul. Most people go to the Vermillions or Lac Seul to target Muskies though. As much time as we have spent on Minnitaki I can only recount once or twice ever seeing a Muskie
3967922,Mark Oakley,2015-06-15 11:08:00,21,dont say muskie to load you mean nortern. muskie dosent open till this sat.

I just dropped somebody off at the Ft Lauderdale Airport and I wanted to jump out and get on a plane back to Sioux Lookout. Great times in Canada. Want to go up sometime on a fall trip. All these years, over 50, but have never been in the fall. Hear that is when the big fish bite! Someday!"
