3970850,deadhead1,2015-06-16 07:52:00,193,"I was out on weekend, not as far a yellow girl but west of there around crescent island area. Lots of walleye in 24 to 28 feet, mostly off of island points with jigs and live minnows or leeches. I tried a few mid lake humps but never found any fish there. A few boats were out on humps but most were fishing island points. I also tried bottom bouncing with leeches and had good results. I have not tried crawlers yet but would expect them to start soon if not already. Of the 5 or 6 places I tried 4 caught fish."

3944657,MuskyMaster,2015-06-07 19:19:00,79,"We're about 10 miles northwest of there. Smallies on the shores, pike in the weeds, evening walleye bite is better, catching some in shallow. Seen several 40+ musky and pike cruising the shallows. Go to bait is the xrap, more specifically yellow perch pattern. Only our 2nd day here."

3946017,Redline,2015-06-08 08:49:00,73,"We have a pretty special family. It's my mom's, grandma's side. We have a reunion every year, plus the fishing trip. I'm 32 and have gone every year since I was 9, minus 2 years due to complications. I used to be the youngest for about 10 years, now we have just as many kids around that age as adults. We make all of our own food, bring our own boats, etc. It's just awesome."

3968090,wiggle,2015-06-15 11:51:00,400,"Just got back Saturday from Sioux Narrows. Spent two days fishing Lobstick Bay. Bass are on their beds, pike everywhere in the shallows(no size), one walleye!! Spent two days out past Yellow Girl towards Deadbroke channel. Saw a lot of walleyes on graph between 20-30' deep. They were not biting very good. We only jigged and bottom bounced with Gulp. No live bait! Found a few in 6-10' feet of water casting cranks to weed edges. A friend of mine is up there for this week, staying at same place. They did bring crawlers. But their first day of fishing(yesterday), was tough for them too! You can catch fish, but not fast and furious. Especially when you can see plenty on graph. They are scattered everywhere right now. No concentrations. I'll try and update how their doing as the week goes on. Thanks, Brad"
