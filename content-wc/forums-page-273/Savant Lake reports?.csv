Just curious if anyone has recently fished Savant...how was the fishing, how deep were the walleyes, any lake trout action etc. The weather forecast looks great. Several days in a row of wind from the west should have fish piled up in a couple of my favorite spots! Thanks in advance for any reports!"

So I'm thinking that there are a number of guys who may fish Savant out of any of the three camps that are also waiting for a report.We won't be there (Wildewood) for another month, so our group would love to hear your report when you get back.Be safe and leave a few for the rest of us.Pooch"
