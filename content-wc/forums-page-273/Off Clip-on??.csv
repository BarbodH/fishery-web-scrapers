3972218,phishfearme,2015-06-16 14:58:00,1242,"thanks for the feedback - seems like using this with any wind would be a waste. when we sit out on the deck in a breeze the skeeters seem to hang out in the ""lee"" (ie: behind your ears) and the odor/or whatever that comes from this clip-on just can't seem to do much if anything. I think I'll save our trip $$ and stick with muskol. phish"
