3976586,farmertut,2015-06-17 20:56:00,2,"On my way to Ear Falls Friday evening. Will be going through Minn.-St.Paul around 1:00 Sat. morning. It's shorter the I-35 East side but was concerned about construction. I took I-35 West last year, but takes a little longer. Is there construction problems? Thanks"
3976962,dutchboy,2015-06-18 04:18:00,5717,At that hour you will be OK. Every road in Minnesota has construction it seems. Enjoy your trip!!
3977074,bigwalleye1,2015-06-18 05:43:00,2632,"There are 5 or 6 miles of construction in the area around and north of 94, but it's 2 lanes of new concrete, just restricted lane numbers due to sharing the road with the southboaund traffic. You should be fine at that time. Remember at the 694/35E juncture to stay in the left lane to go north on 35E."
3977986,mms3rd,2015-06-18 09:18:00,148,Drove up 35E on the way to Canada last week and used 35W on the way back. There were a couple slow downs going north on 35E and only volume slow downs on 35W when we returned on the 14th. I've tried to clock the time differences but just find 35E easier.
3978378,farmertut,2015-06-18 11:01:00,2,Thanks for the help guys. Sounds like I'll give the east side a try.
3979906,drew59,2015-06-18 18:30:00,87,I did it a week ago. I suggest 35E northbound and 35W southbound.
