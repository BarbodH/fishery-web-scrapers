Leave a residue that could damage anything?Just got me to thinking. We have an estate sale coming up an the bugs are really bad in the wooded location of the sale. Gonna drive buyers away, I'm afraid.Also, considering for the boat (long shot).Pooch"
3966282,wmd,2015-06-14 20:46:00,388,"Pooch Go to your local farm and fleet store and buy Tempo. It is safe to use and dries to a powder, insects walk crawl on it and the contact kills them. It is on the surface you spray until it is washed off or un tip it is all picked up by insects. Can be used in food manufacturing facilities etc so it is quite safe to use. It is also more effective than Bronco and goes much further because you mix it with water. wmd"
3966698,Pooch,2015-06-15 06:30:00,4619,Thanks. Was headed for F&F later today for other odds and ends. Probably try to see if they carry it.Pooch
3966850,alberta bum,2015-06-15 07:07:00,312,"I was the one who mentioned it.. I was out with my uncle fishing Erie and we were getting attacked by those **** flys.. He has some stables, when I dropped him off at his house he said hold on and went and walked into the stable. Came back and handed me a bottle of this stuff and he said spray it around your boat to get rid of the flys. I sprayed under the console, on the vinyl floor and the inside of the gunnels.. It worked! Now when I travel to northern Ontario I bring a bottle with me to spray on the cabin decks and inside the camp boat. Does it wrk 100%,, no.. But my ankles always look better than most guests at the lodges. What your talking about spraying,, I'm sure it wouldn't hurt to try"
3968018,Pooch,2015-06-15 11:37:00,4619,"Here in Central Illinois is is wet. Really really wet. We've had over a foot of rain in the last eight days. So flies and bugs are pretty bad out in the shop. Thought of using something there and if it works and is not offensive I might take some with me to Canada in a few weeks. May try a little in the boat if needed. It's my own boat, not a camp boat. I'd be reluctant to spray something in a boat that others also use.Thanks for the tip.Pooch"
3969066,kzoofisher,2015-06-15 16:18:00,5144,I'm going to pick some up for my crawlspace where I have spider problems. Reading up on itI see that some caution is required.

3969946,stevensinks,2015-06-15 20:41:00,330,I used it on the boat last year when my wife and I were at Red Lake. I sure seemed to help.
3979682,Skywagon,2015-06-18 17:28:00,1106,"Tempo is an excellent choice, is safe and works great. It should work fine for your application at the sale. A container of concentrate is not cheap, but lasts forever. Cargill uses it, so you know it is food grade approved. Will probably even work on that bedbug problem Pooch."
