3973122,Fishoil,2015-06-16 20:30:00,1277,I was using #14 Husky Jerks for pike on my Canada trip last week and discovered that the hooks are no match for a thrashing northern. I want to replace them with something stronger before my next trip and buy some spares to carry. What hooks would you suggest for them that wouldn't be mangled or broken so easily?

One fewer hook doesn't lead to any lost fish and its easier to unhook a thrashing pike with 2 sets of trebles instead of 3. Go one size larger with the treble in front and back (on a #14 HJ that'd be a #2 I think). Always make sure the larger treble isn't so big that it hangs up on the lip of the bait.."
