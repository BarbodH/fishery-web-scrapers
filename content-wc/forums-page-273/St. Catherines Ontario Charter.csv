I'd like to fish walleye, but I am open to any species. Any past experience/suggestions would be appreciated. PjShorthorn"

I would suggest a charter on Lake Erie/Niagara River for walleye and smallies. No personal experience with any of the charter guys, but Paul Castellano of http://www.castadventures.ca/ enjoys a very good reputation. Many to choose from. Good luck."
