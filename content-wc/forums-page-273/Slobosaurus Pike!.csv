3973442,BuckeyeBill,2015-06-16 22:32:00,76,"Good grief that's a huge pike !! I'm thinking more like the ""Jaws"" line....you're going to need a bigger boat !!"
3974522,blackxpress,2015-06-17 08:54:00,70,Choot him! Choot him! Don't choot da boat!!
3974570,Mike Borger,2015-06-17 09:09:00,1554,"We created a new lingo for the pike we caught this past trip that was vehicle related.Small pike: Mini (as in ""it's just a Mini - nothing to see here"")Mid size pike: Camry (as in ""hmm...this one's a Camry - no, don't need the camera but it's a fun drive!"" )Giant Goliath: Hummer (as in ""holy s#@&* I've got a freakin' HUMMER on dude - I LOVE hummers!!)"
3976730,Knoxabilly,2015-06-17 22:00:00,225,I like the lingo Mike!
3977258,Draco1206,2015-06-18 06:49:00,175,"""Hummer"" had a whole different meaning when I was younger. Got to admit Though, I love ""hummers"" too. Both kinds!"
3967978,Mike Borger,2015-06-15 11:33:00,1554,"Just returned from North Caribou on Sunday, what a great week! We set a new camp record for group total of pike over 40"" in a week. Previous number was 28 held by a group of 10. My group of 4 boated 34 including some true giants.Numbers would have been even crazier if the weather had been good. We battled cool temps, wind, fronts and rain almost all week. Only the last two days were sunny and nice. I'm never a ""numbers"" guy but when it comes to huge pike I tend to keep track.Walleye were limitless, honestly. If you actually targeted them you'd get worn out pretty quickly. Detailed write up on the trip will be done probably by the weekend. Until then here's one of the giants I boated last week."
3968266,Aspencreek,2015-06-15 12:32:00,2911,"Oh my! That's one of those ""Gilligan...we are going to need a bigger boat""!!!.......I just can't imagine the amount of wonderful slime that came off that one."
3968290,retire55,2015-06-15 12:42:00,1029,Nice gator Mike!
3968354,bftiger,2015-06-15 13:07:00,21,Have any idea how many inches long that pike is?
3968402,Golden Eagle,2015-06-15 13:17:00,2642,That's why we go fishing. Beauty of a pike.
3969010,chris.brock,2015-06-15 16:05:00,112,"What a fish factory! A special lake for sure, I've never seen anything quite like it. Nose to the grindstone, get that report up Bud."
3969098,Mike Borger,2015-06-15 16:28:00,1554,For the rest of you guys Chris was my boat partner for the week. Not sure but I think I nearly killed him.
3969130,pjshorthorn,2015-06-15 16:36:00,5654,"If you keep catching fish this size, you may want to schedule regular appointments with the doctor to make sure the ticker is still OK. I'm not sure anyone's heart can sustain that kind of excitement consistently !!!! That sir, is a beast. PjShorthorn."
3969138,new hips,2015-06-15 16:40:00,498,Can't wait for the report..........that's a beautiful Pike.Thanks for the preview
