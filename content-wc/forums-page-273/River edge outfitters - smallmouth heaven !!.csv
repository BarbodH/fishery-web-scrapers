Big V has Lake Trout, Smallmouth, Pike, Muskies & perch but no walleye. 5 minutes down the road is the Launch ramp for Lost Lake which is part of Lac Seul where everybody goes for walleye. If you like to catch smallies, Big V is a great lake for them."
3971514,BuckeyeBill,2015-06-16 11:08:00,76,"My son and I just got back Sunday 6/14 from Northwest Ontario. In between Hudson & Sioux Lookout. What a fantastic trip we had. We used counters to keep track of the fish we caught (it's a competition thing between us) and we ended up with 443 smallmouth ranging in size from 15"" to 19"". Caught many of them on topwater prop baits that I make during the winter. What a blast. Musky!! The season for musky's doesn't begin until the end of June so they must be immediately released. On Thursday morning I caught a 40"" on a 5"" fluke - 8# test. Sorry no pic of this one. That evening we went back to the same bay and my son caught a 50 + on a 7"" fluke. He did have a leader but it was still on 8# test. We took a pic of it in the water and then released immediately. In fact all fish were released. We saw many other Muskies and had quite a few follows. Many in the 50"" class. What a thrill. They seemed to love the white 5"" flukes we were throwing for the smallies. The lake also has Lake Trout but we have no clue on how to catch them as they move deeper. Going to have to research it some before next season. We didn't spend much time on them. To busy catching smallies! Weather was good. Cam and Ann run a beautiful camp with beautiful cabins, great docks & clean grounds. 1st class operation. Already booked for next year."

3971778,Carnhzkr,2015-06-16 12:41:00,964,I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that you guys are Buckeye fans.
3971898,BuckeyeBill,2015-06-16 13:06:00,76,Guilty as charged. I've been a Buckeye fan since the Woody Hayes days. My son was of course corrupted by me.
3972834,BuckeyeBill,2015-06-16 19:12:00,76,Here are some pics of the topwater prop baits I make. These are hand carved from Balsa with all stainless steel hardware. I use the best KVD treble hooks. They are weighted in the back so at rest the back end sits low in the water. When you are reeling it pops to the surface and the prop goes to work. The smallmouth can't stand it. Had many explosive hits !!
3973546,kzoofisher,2015-06-17 03:38:00,5144,Nice looking lures. I'm surprised a Buckeye would use a blue lure
3973706,jfaisten,2015-06-17 05:20:00,1060,sounds like a great trip smallies and muskies -- doesn't get much better than that
3974258,BuckeyeBill,2015-06-17 07:50:00,76,Good one kzoofisher. Actually I'm an old school Buckeye fan who has great respect for the Wolverines. Now that you have the right coach I expect the rivalry to heat back up and be like it should be. Back to the Woody and Bo days!!
3976130,kzoofisher,2015-06-17 18:19:00,5144,"I sure hope we get another run like the '70s. Heard today that UM, MSU, OSU and PSU all have top 15 ranked recruiting classes right now. I'm sure that will change some by February but it's pretty impressive anyway. Wisconsin and Nebraska are looking like they have a much easier path to the Rose Bowl now than anyone in the East."
3976714,Knoxabilly,2015-06-17 21:47:00,225,This sounds like a lot of fun! What lake did you fish on for the Smallies- I went to the outfitters site but it states you can fish on numerous different lakes
