A trolling motor would be nice also. Tiller would be my first choice, but would do a walk thru windshield also.Would like it for 4-5 days and would pay cash.Thanks!Would be going in near Sioux Lookout / Hudson area.Let me know what you have!!"

The group next to us had a boat, outboard and trailer they rented from Red Pine Lodge, name on the side and everything. Seemed like quite a nice rig. No idea on the rate, but it's in the area, and I thought about your inquiry. Good luck"
