Also we like places that promote conservation practices.Over the last several years we have seen this to be much needed for most lakes to sustain.We will cross at Sault Ste. Marie. Thanks for any help. Good Fishing, Pikeman"

Prairie Bee is another option, it is a boat-in camp and has an outpost at the far end of the lake. Both lodges are about 200 miles NE of Sault Ste. Marie. I have never been to either of these camps, but they both look very nice. Good luck Â– Stu."
3829449,pjshorthorn,2015-05-01 07:27:00,5654,I was reading up on lodges this morning through the website www.onlinefishing.com Probably one of the most comprehensive sites I've seen regarding lodges and outposts located in Ontario. It includes approximate costs per person as well. PjShorthorn

Check Ghost River Lodge, they have a website. It is boat in, they bring you in on a boat. More pike and walleye than you can imagine.Karl"
