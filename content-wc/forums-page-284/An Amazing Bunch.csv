3829369,bigwalleye1,2015-05-01 07:00:00,2632,"x1000. Thank you to our Vietnam Vets. This was the war of my childhood, and, the dis-service many of you endured upon your return home can never be rectified. Additionally, thank you to all of our vets, both US and Canadian, and all other freedom loving countries, for your sacrifices around the world to kepp the rest of us safe in our beds."
3829937,Bakefish,2015-05-01 10:36:00,1077,Back at you Bobby.USN Tin Can Sailor 1969-1973
3830169,bobbylfishermon,2015-05-01 11:52:00,241,"Hey Bakefish,the guys we really should be THANKING are the dead, who gave it all, for their brothers and sisters in arms. The VietNam memorial was a start, but the REAL HEAD count is over 200,000 dead, but political correctness by our government and other governments will never admit to that!! What a waste of FINE YOUNG MEN... FOR WHAT.....so the rich get richer, and the poor and middle class pay with their lives !! USMC 1970-71."
3830273,Bakefish,2015-05-01 12:41:00,1077,"That's the way of the world B. We make darn sure we take care of our invaders (illegals), but have homeless combat vets living in the streets. This country should be ashamed. Really ashamed. It absolutely sickens me."
3830377,bobbylfishermon,2015-05-01 14:01:00,241,"The squeaky wheels get the grease, our Vets need to hold our congressmen and senators ( 80 % of them have never served our nation) feet to the fire! Lets start the ""NEXT"" conflict with the sons & daughters of our congress & senate, the first ""troops"" in and the last out!! That will put a QUICK stop to our so called ""leaders"" starting another ASSININE WAR......"
3830441,Shellback,2015-05-01 14:35:00,8083,I think this should have been posted on the General Discussion board. I think Canada and the Canadians have had enough of US politics and wars.
3830457,Bakefish,2015-05-01 14:38:00,1077,Canadians aren't allowed on the General Discussion board?
3830657,Draco1206,2015-05-01 15:30:00,175,"I agree 100%. It's seems like Bobby and others don't know this is a fishing forum not a ""General Discussion"" forum, or a forum to spout your political views unless it has to do with fishing. Even though I agree with your tribute to vets I don't agree with your politics Bobby, and this is not the appropriate forum. Please move this to the ""General Discussion"" forum so Bobby and others can get on their soapbox and vent."
3830769,bobbylfishermon,2015-05-01 16:54:00,241,I totally agree with you Shellback.
