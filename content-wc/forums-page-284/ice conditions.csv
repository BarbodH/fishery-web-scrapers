3789665,Blue Lk,2015-04-20 18:00:00,269,"For those of you familiar with the V-Bay area,The little lake where Wilderness Air""s base is located is wide open today.This lake is usually open 7-10 days before the rest of the lakes in the area.Our weather has cooled with night time temps a few degrees below freezing,supposed to warm up by the weekend."
3791937,prov1800,2015-04-21 08:38:00,5010,"Hope your right, iam ready.sucks today and the rest of the week.but it will melt and give us some much needed mousture on the lakes.they sure are low everywhere."
3792601,bobbylfishermon,2015-04-21 10:25:00,241,"Right on Blue Lake, so Long is open eh, fished that lake 5-6 years ago, put in off the road to V-Bay, we caught a bunch of smallies 2-5lbs and some eater snakes(I Y-bone them), don't know if there are walleyes in there, but would like to find out!! It won't be long now, sounds like low water eh.... take care"

3695362,Blue Lk,2015-03-26 13:57:00,269,"My guess last week of April,the snow melt hasn't changed in the last week"
3695778,prov1800,2015-03-26 16:09:00,5010,As far as ice out goes its all a guess.i live just north of vermilion bay and ive still got a bunch of snow in my yard.lol.been fishing a lot most days and most snow is off the lakes except for the moguls which kinda slow you down.ice 30+ inches of rock solid stuff with some frozen slush on top.auger just making it through.the warm weather wehad did a good job.but now its cold again.not much will change till it starts staying above 0c overnights.was fishing sunday and it wad making ice that day.been making ice for the last few days now with no snow cover.check the weather network going to be mostly -4-7 for next week.but ice will be gone before the opener like it always is.

3699866,v-bay gord,2015-03-27 12:35:00,3168,"There's a link to East Cape Resorts. We always stay at the Playa Del Sol. Very small and quiet, and always the same friendly people who work there. If you need a boat / captain recommendation here's three good ones........Martin on the Maria 2, Raymond on the El Tio, and Edgar on the Time Out."

I couldn't get away with the crocthless chaps,somebody would call OPP, wondering if some old man had wandered away from the home and forgot half his draws!! My wife says ""you're still 6ft. tall, but, some where along the line, you've developed a severe case of monkey butt!! That old woman has no respect for the elderly!! Nice Marlin man, I'm shooting for a SKI that big this year, probably have to come over to Eagle to get it... Thanks again..."
3700930,v-bay gord,2015-03-27 16:41:00,3168,Monkey butt? That's harsh! What's her butt look like.......never mind!
3703234,bobbylfishermon,2015-03-28 11:52:00,241,"Her butt is still fine,especially for a 59 year old, yet gravity isn't as kind to woman if you know what I mean, take care man"
