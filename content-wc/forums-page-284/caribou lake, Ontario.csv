3821321,bubblehead,2015-04-28 14:27:00,18,"ziggyzag, a few reasons why we like going to this Lake:#1 is I can bring my own boat/gear. Both Forrest and Bear Paw have some pretty nice lodge boats. But I have a 20 ft. Lund Fisherman. I can put the top up when it rains. I have ALL my own gear, my own electronics, and my own space. Over the years I've gotten too used to having everything you can think of in the boat. I'd never be able to haul all that stuff and put it in somebody else's boat. (They'd need to provide bigger boats) I can pull up to the pier at either place, plug in the charger, and walk to the our lodging.#2 I can catch all the walleyes I want, Trophy size northern, and when I get tired of that, go for Lake Trout. Not many lakes have all 3 fisheries. AND, there's no **** BASS.#3 It's remote enough I feel I'm getting a good Canadian experience. Yes, you will see other boats, but it's not like sharing the lake in N WI. And, with 45,000+ acres, you should be able to find someplace to fish.#4 The people who run both of these lodges (sorry, I have no experience with Caribou Lake Lodge) are REALLY nice. And the facilities are great."
3822385,drew59,2015-04-28 19:09:00,87,I agree with everything bubblehead said except we rent a boat. Forrest Lodge has 16 foot Lunds with 30hp 4 strokes. Really nice for a camp boat.
3824849,adempsey,2015-04-29 13:10:00,963,"Well, I managed to obtain a little bit more of the lake, but not much. I have a feeling this is about as much as I am going to be able to get without A LOT of extra effort.I recommend 'Right Click' and then ""Save Link As"" to download the pdf file.http://www.lineonfishing.com/images/...ke_South_2.pdf"
3828857,drew59,2015-04-30 20:39:00,87,Excellent! I really appreciate it. I'll bet bubblehead does too.
3789857,adempsey,2015-04-20 18:26:00,963,"I've never been to Caribou Lake, it's just one of many lakes I'd like to visit.Here are the two maps I have. I will have to contact the MNR again and see if I can get the missing map. www.lineonfishing.com/images/Ontario_Outpost_Lake_Maps/Caribou_Lake_South-end.pdfwww.lineonfishing.com/images/Ontario_Outpost_Lake_Maps/Caribou_Lake-NW_4k.pdf"
3790025,drew59,2015-04-20 19:00:00,87,You are the man! If you can get the other PLEASE let me know. Thanks!
3817041,bubblehead,2015-04-27 14:47:00,18,"We've been going to Forrest Lodge for years. We typically go the week after Memorial Day, and spend about 10 days up there. Besides the walleye and northern fishing, we've caught quite a few Lake Trout. The guy that goes with me in the spring, also usually goes with another group in the fall. Same thing. No shortage of Lake Trout. there are only 3 outfitters on the lake, all on the south end. The cabins way up in the northern end, are referred to as Little America, and they're private. (it's not worth the ride up there either unless you're just sight seeing) Have never seen, nor heard of a topo map of the lake. Would love t have one. But after all these years, I've got a lot of hazards and trails marked on my GPS."
3817113,bubblehead,2015-04-27 14:52:00,18,"drew59, Even the Lodge owners don't have these maps. That's unbelievable. Thanks. Look forward to seeing the last one. Thanks again."
3817377,ziggyzag,2015-04-27 16:01:00,125,Have you seen the Caribou Lake Lodge cabins??
3819577,bubblehead,2015-04-28 06:18:00,18,"Have not been to the Lodge on the island. We stay at Forrest Lodge in the spring, and my buddy and his group stay at Bear Paw in the fall. Have been through both of those. Nice facilities. We like the drive to features of those places. We don't have to load up everything in a boat and haul it across the lake."
3819585,bubblehead,2015-04-28 06:20:00,18,Will be nice to see the other map if you can find it. Thanks
3819897,adempsey,2015-04-28 07:24:00,963,"I've contacted the MNR, so we'll see. I am not all that hopeful though. I've come across this a few times already and they never seem to know where the missing files went."
3820905,mms3rd,2015-04-28 11:53:00,148,Ontario MNR just told me that they do not sell maps any longer and gave me links to a variety of websites for businesses that do. Maybe I misunderstood.
3821265,adempsey,2015-04-28 14:13:00,963,"No, that is correct. I signed an agreement with the MNR a couple of years ago to obtain digital scans of all the maps. The companies they directed you to did the same. As I slowly go through the files I am discovering that some maps are missing, so I am hoping someone at the MNR might be able to help. It would be rather unfortunate if this information was completely ""lost"", but that may be the situation. I have a feeling the original copies are packed away in boxes sitting in a basement somewhere next to Fox Mulder."
3778097,Guest,2015-04-17 14:49:00,0,"I am thinking of going to Caribou Lake next Spring, just wondering if anyone knows of an outfitter on the north end of the lake? It appears that the south end would be deep water more for lakers, we are walleye and pike guys."
3778177,redryder,2015-04-17 15:25:00,33,More than one Caribou lake in Ontario. Whats the closest town/city?
3778337,Guest,2015-04-17 16:26:00,0,"Sorry I knew that ""Armstrong"""
3778865,drew59,2015-04-17 19:52:00,87,"I've been going to Caribou for 10+ years. There are only three outfitters on the lake, all on the ""south"" end. We like Forrest Lodge. In the spring you will find walleyes and pike less than ten minutes from camp. It's a large lake with plenty of places to go without seeing other boats. Let me know if you want more info."
3778929,adempsey,2015-04-17 20:07:00,963,"The three camps that I am aware of (Bear Paw LOdge, Forrest Lodge and Caribou Lake Lodge) are all in the southern basin. There are some cabins in the north end, but I am guessing they are private? http://binged.it/1Jd84lChttp://binged.it/1Jd85Gkhttp://binged.it/1Jd8f0ihttp://binged.it/1Jd8h8zI also took a quick look at a depth map and there are still good areas for Walleye fishing in the southern basin."
3779273,ziggyzag,2015-04-17 22:07:00,125,looks like all your attached pictures are of docks on the North end
3780985,drew59,2015-04-18 14:58:00,87,Where did you find a contour map of Caribou Lake? I didn't think there was one. I would LOVE to have one!
3781585,adempsey,2015-04-18 18:36:00,963,"Sorry, I don't know why I even put those links in, lol. Was just showing the cabins on the north end of the lake."
3781601,adempsey,2015-04-18 18:37:00,963,"From the Ontario MNR. Unfortunately, I am missing one of three maps. I have no idea why they didn't include it in the set. I have the southern basin and a small part of the north. I will put them up for you when I have some time do so."
3781657,ziggyzag,2015-04-18 19:02:00,125,When was the last time you where their? Love to hear what you think about Caribou
