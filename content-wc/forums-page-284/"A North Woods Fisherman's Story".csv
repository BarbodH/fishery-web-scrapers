3710794,Lovetofish,2015-03-30 12:33:00,458,After I read it the first time Bill I had to by a map to follow the story.
3731130,turkeyriver,2015-04-05 08:30:00,80,"Got my copy in the mail yesterday and am about half way through. I know I'm going to wish it was longer! As a fellow Iowan,living in one of the most altered landscapes in the country, natural resource-wise, I share a need to escape to the North every year and see some clean water! Don't you all wish you could go back in time and see what Al saw on his trips, even for one day? The cover page says it all and I hope Bill doesn't mind my quoting here,""And why do you go there? they asked. For the water, the land, and the sky, I replied. But that's everywhere, I heard them say, And I knew that they didn't understand."" It's not about the size of the fish, it's about the size of the experience."
3731250,JayM5209,2015-04-05 08:58:00,1050,"turkeyriver, you've captured the essence of it all. Thanks for your comments."
3732250,Bill Krejca,2015-04-05 14:41:00,6107,Turkey - I had originally written my above noted synopsis on the back of a wilderness photo which I gave some years ago to my camping/fishing buddies after our latest trip to God's country. The photo was taken from the island on which we fall camped on Obabikon Lake. It seemed appropriate to include in the book. Bill
3823177,IAWally,2015-04-29 04:18:00,38,"Bill, I received my copy last Friday. Told the wife that's what I wanted for my Birthday. What a wonderful book it is and Thank You for signing it."
3823249,pjshorthorn,2015-04-29 04:55:00,5654,"I just received 3 copies of Bill's book as well. I'm giving a copy to my father and one to my son as part of their birthday gift this year when we celebrate them together at Vermilion Bay Lodge. My father turns 75, my son 20 and myself 50 all within a couple of months of each other this summer. I can't think of a better way to spend a week than to be with them and enjoy the opportunity to be together and celebrate these milestones in our lives. Of course, I got the third copy for myself It is going to be tough to wait until July to read the book !!!!! PjShorthorn"
3594594,dutchboy,2015-02-27 20:16:00,5717,"Thank you, thats exactly what I was looking for. This is the type of stories I was hoping to find. I'll be ordering a copy tomorrow.Al found that by riding his bicycle to work year around in summer's heat and winter's cold, and limiting automobile trips, he could save enough gas coupons to permit travel into northern Minnesota, if not Canada. This was another indication of the degree of his addiction to the north woods, since he had to be at work at 3:00 in the morning, and the 5 mile sojourn by bike might include rain, snow drifts, and always darkened streets. Are we that dedicated to fishing or if gas goes up 5 cents a gallon will we stay home?"
3595906,Bill Krejca,2015-02-28 08:35:00,6107,"Thanks for the kind words, folks, my web site is www.billkrejca.com. Bill"
3595970,tooski,2015-02-28 08:55:00,393,"Bill, Took your book on one of my solo fly-ins for those rainy days in the cabin. My only regret is that it was too short- great read, thanks."
3599866,Larry S,2015-03-01 12:18:00,665,"Bill, Got your book in 2011,went to re-read it and found that your book and a number of others have been damaged, have sent you an order to replace your book as I enjoy reading it every time Take care and Good Fishing Larry S"
3599914,Obabikon,2015-03-01 12:34:00,2370,"Its a great book! I suggest it for any outdoorsman (or woman)! Very enjoyable, and it always brings up my own personal experiences."
3599970,v-bay gord,2015-03-01 12:51:00,3168,"Bill, I printed off your order form and will be getting several of your books for the lodge. It's always fun to read about the early fishing days. There's not enough interest in the nostalgia amongst some of the more modern anglers these days. Too much science, technology, ego, and emphasis on who can catch the biggest and the most (with the least amount of effort) these days. It's always refreshing to reflect back on a simpler time...."
3600034,JayM5209,2015-03-01 13:15:00,1050,"Gord, does your library have a copy of Yesterday, the River: A History of the Ear Falls District? A year or so ago someone mentioned it in a thread here on WC. I searched and searched, finally finding what seemed like the only copy available on the continent at a used book dealer in NJ. It is a fascinating read. Makes an excellent companion to Bill's book."
3600450,v-bay gord,2015-03-01 14:42:00,3168,"No Jay I don't. I will make a few local inquiries to see if I can get my hands on one. Right now my ""library"" is more musky oriented and I'm always on the look-out for some old time stuff. As I slowly get older, some of the stuff I bought as a ""kid"" is looking pretty collectable now! I'm sure you know the feeling...... Oh, my.....I found a copy, but it's pricey! http://www.amazon.ca/Yesterday-River.../dp/0919212794 O.K.....I found one that's a lot less..........ordered. Thanks Jay!"
3600514,Pooch,2015-03-01 15:01:00,4619,"Is a long read. If you are a Canadian history buff, this book is for you. My buddy Tom introduced me to it a number of years ago and I really enjoyed it. Might bring it out and read it again since you guys mentioned it.Pooch"
3709938,Lovetofish,2015-03-30 08:24:00,458,"Bill, you mailed me your book 5 years ago. I re-read it yesterday while watching the two NCAA basketball games. What a great book. Of course, I had to get my tackle boxes out last night then clean up some fishing rods."
3593674,Knoxabilly,2015-02-27 17:09:00,225,I just finished this- what an awesome book. This has my juices flowing to head North. Thanks for writing this Bill- great job!
3593794,Carnhzkr,2015-02-27 17:53:00,964,"I'm gonna have to find a copy of that book, especially since Bill lives just down the road from me (maybe I can get it autographed). I'd checked the local library and no dice. I know it can be had from Amazon."
3593818,dutchboy,2015-02-27 17:59:00,5717,Whats the authors full name?
3593898,Knoxabilly,2015-02-27 18:10:00,225,I ordered mine on Amazon- his name is William A Krejca

3594314,dutchboy,2015-02-27 19:24:00,5717,Is there anywhere I can read a preview of what the book is about?
