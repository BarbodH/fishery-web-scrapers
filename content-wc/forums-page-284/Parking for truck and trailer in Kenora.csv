3818417,lassh,2015-04-27 19:23:00,553,Going up to Lake of Woods last week in May. Where would the best place be to park my truck and boat trailer for a week? I'll probably launch out of Kenora but could go out of Clearwater Bay. Any thoughts?

It seems everyone out of country using that marina is just a burden to him unless he has recently sold out to someone else. Haven't been back there in 7 years. If someone knows if things have changed please chime in."
