3816241,MrSimon,2015-04-27 11:17:00,922,"Everyone has to make the best decisions for their family, and I won't judge anyone else's decisions. But for me, not going North at least once a year is not an option. I'm going, and that's that. For 51 weeks a year my family is my number one priority. Diaper changes, help with homework, T-ball games, beach vacations, in-law visits, home repairs, paying the bills etc etc etc. But for one week a year ......well, you guys know. Granted, I have an incredibly agreeable wife. Although last year was the first time in 15 years that she complained .... apparently she didn't like being left alone for 10 days straight with three kids, one being a baby. It didn't help that it was the first week of school for the two older kids."
3816729,KevinSB,2015-04-27 13:06:00,73,"I agree with MrSimon, including not to judge others' circumstances and decisions. I also agree about the 51/1 issue: I work hard and spend most of my time helping my wife and two daughters with myriad needs (ranging from coaching sports to doing dishes to helping with homework). It's constantly loud and hectic in our house and the one week I year I can totally unwind is fishing with one or more of my best friends up north. I'm sure I'll miss the chaos when kids are grown and am in no hurry for that to happen, but especially so long as things are crazy I treasure the calm during my annual (this year will be my sixth in Canada) fishing trip!"
3819177,btyreprich,2015-04-28 03:42:00,1067,"When I asked my wife to marry me, she knew how much I enjoyed fishing. When we were first married and had no kids / two incomes, two weeks of fishing was common. Fast forward 30 years and three kids, I have to save my pennies and work a second job to go fishing with the younger son. Other kids don't enjoy fishing for a full week. As a way to thank my wife & ensure my future fishing trips, I urged my wife to go on vacations with her girlfriends. When she mentioned Las Vegas for a 4 day trip with her friends, I said go for it. Gave her several hundred dollars from my part time job to really enjoy herself out there. It's only fair given how many times she. Has stayed home with the other two kids. (She would tell me that my leaving for a week is her vacation!!)"
3799041,ziggyzag,2015-04-22 16:28:00,125,Pulled the Father in-law card good thinking!!
3799385,bthomas3333,2015-04-22 18:07:00,465,Been using that card for years. PAINFUL... but it is impossible for the better half to say no to a trip with dad and both grandfathers. 'Unfortunately' the Father-in-law is turning 80 and said he could do it anymore. The hard part was the father-in-law wasn't a fisherman. He insisted on me taking every fish off his hook for 15 years...never learned how to tie a boat to a dock...could handle doing a single dish not to mention not being able to complain about the wife while fishing:-) Oh well I will actually probably miss him this year. B-
3799721,Baseline,2015-04-22 19:20:00,3207,Fortunately I live in northern MN and Canada is a long weekend fishing trip for both open water and ice. I also spend a couple of week long trip each year. Fortunately my I married an only child who was used to doing her own thing so she actually looks forward to my days away from home. The beach trips with her are taken in the winter and spring and she makes sure I spend at least 1/3 of that time on the ocean fishing. I feel your pain. Remember you don't need a large group to head up there. A couple of guys can have a great time chasing those walleyes.
3799873,Da' Walleye Assassun,2015-04-22 19:54:00,358,Thanks for the advice. Heading north is not life or death for me. It's more important. Sorry to ruffle your feathers.
3799905,bushead11,2015-04-22 20:09:00,151,I was getting push back and like i said we were going every other year. This most recent i played the brother in law card. He is now doing the same with his new wife. I think the girls are on to us be we dont care as long as they still give us the green light!
3799985,ziggyzag,2015-04-22 20:27:00,125,"Yes you will my dads trip last year was his last, it will probably be harder on him not being able to go for sure."
3800025,ziggyzag,2015-04-22 20:42:00,125,"Just started this thread trying to get acquainted with some of the regular users. I know anyone who is a regular fisher person who fishes Northwestern Ontario has the same desire to go as much as possible. Nothing to be sorry for! went sucker fishing this evening: (3) white suckers (2) walleye ~ ""beats a sharp stick"""
3800033,ziggyzag,2015-04-22 20:49:00,125,No doubt!!
3801017,SinOrSwim,2015-04-23 06:19:00,1528,Oh nelly. LOL You are a better man than me. LOL Mine isn't a fisherman necessarily but he baits his hooks and takes his own fish off and all that. Although the old saying what happens in Canada stays in Canada holds true. He has gone on our group trip a couple times now and was drinking one night and said some things that I wish I had never heard. LOLOLOLOL some of that information is the kind of information I didn't need to know. Wasn't bad in a group setting. I'm just a little worried this time it will just be the two of us and my son. A LOT of alone time and he is a question asker.
3813657,P&y only,2015-04-26 17:45:00,133,"I can respect you for your commitment to your family. But, if you can afford it, remember that life is only so long. And one day you will be too old to get in a boat. It is THEN that you will most regret not going EVERY chance you get. I'm a firm believer in living your life while you have one. Tomorrow is not promised. Live today! Tight lines my friend!"
3797337,ziggyzag,2015-04-22 10:10:00,125,Da' Walleye ***: I guess you the man with such a powerful tag name. Practice catch and release
3797361,bushead11,2015-04-22 10:14:00,151,"Our group went in august 2010 and july 2012 with one outfitter on the body of water we fish. In 2014 we changed outfitters and booked the last week of May due to a cancelation from a group that had been going for 10+ years. It was hands down the best experience any of us had had in Canada and we vowed that we would not let any group take our week next year in fear we would not get it back. 2/8 guys (I was one of them) put deposits down and said we would work it out before next year. Guess what... all but one (birth of second child expected May 10th) is making the trip back. I think each of us had to make sacrifices with the better half to make sure we could attend an annual ""self healing"" in the north woods. As a father of 3 boys under 7 and having a wife that works full time it was no easy task. All said and done, my reels have new line and my tackle box has some new additions and working on the meal plan as we speak... I hope that things change for you but there was no way I could continue waiting every other year..."
3797641,ziggyzag,2015-04-22 11:22:00,125,Bushead11: Glade to see your making a annual trip and maybe I will get hooked up with a group that goes in the odd years. See my sons and nephews all are starting their families and they can not afford to go every year. As you can see from the post I guess not being lucky enough to get free trips thru outfitters that get endorsed here or financially set make you a mouse or you have no back bone.
3797729,vteye,2015-04-22 11:53:00,812,"Hey Zig - We are in the same pattern every other year. A couple of the guys can't afford each year. I am going into Kayedon 2nd week in June, 2015 our second trip to Ont. College is finally paid for and 50 some odd days left."
3797865,ziggyzag,2015-04-22 12:22:00,125,vteye: Glade to see our group is not the only one here living in reality. I have been to Kayedon before I assume you are going with Remi and AWO is this your first trip to Kayedon?
3797937,ablack86,2015-04-22 12:35:00,17,The narrows between kayedon and Ogoki will have you catching walleye on nearly every cast. enjoy!
3798137,Draco1206,2015-04-22 13:31:00,175,"Hey Ziggyzag, my suggestion to ""grow some hair"" was said in jest. I guess I should have put a smiley imogee there. You are the one that implied you couldn't go every year because your wife wouldn't let you, you never said it was because of finances. So you shouldn't be upset if a few guys suggest that you ""squeak up"", get ""proactive"", or to even ""grow some hair"". I thought my suggestion to send the girls south to a sunny beach was a good one and meant to help you find a way to go fishing every year. Most guys are just having fun with you and we feel for you. But it's time to ""put on your big boy pants"" and to ""put your foot down"" and show the wife who the real ""boss"" is. Just kidding."
3798217,vteye,2015-04-22 13:48:00,812,"Second trip to Kayedon w/Remi... Ablack - last trip not a single walleye was caught anywhere near the narrows, very familiar with that area. We went up at ice out and bluebird skies, tough on eyes but overall a good trip."
3798281,ziggyzag,2015-04-22 13:55:00,125,No problem
3798985,SinOrSwim,2015-04-22 16:13:00,1528,"My annual trip is in September and I wanted to take my son again this year like we did last year. I couldn't quite get the second trip approved by the boss but she also doesnt' want him missing school in September. It got to the point of desperation. I got the trip approved. It is now Me, My son..................and my father in law..............just the 3 of us. LOL THAT is dedication, I tell ya"
3795521,ziggyzag,2015-04-21 21:54:00,125,"Just wanted to say my family, Sons, Dads, Grandpa, Cousins Uncles go to Canada every other year for the past 35 years flying out of Nakina and this year is our off year. I can tell all you guys that the reports you post here almost make it bearable for me to get through until our next great Canadian adventure. Thanks to all who share there adventure on here. MAN I WISH I WAS GOING THIS SPRING!!! ""Kap, Kag, Melttch, Tennant, Tester, Ara, Brace, Kaydon, and the hit list could just go on. I hope everyone who is going this year has a great time and a safe fishing season. So make sure you all post when you get back so I can live the dream through you until its my turn again next year.

3795545,Aspencreek,2015-04-21 22:00:00,2911,"I understand your plight, BUT.....you could start your own tradition and go up with a new group of friends on the off years, that way you go every year."
3795577,ziggyzag,2015-04-21 22:38:00,125,That would be nice but wife might not think so. The odd years have been for the wife and girls. Just to bad their not into fishing.
3795585,ziggyzag,2015-04-21 22:40:00,125,got an opening in your group this year?? LOL
3795673,Mike Borger,2015-04-22 03:20:00,1554,Good God man that's an intolerable situation. Be proactive! We'll all be here for you when the time comes (see below )https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAryFIuRxmQ
3795689,Draco1206,2015-04-22 03:39:00,175,Not sure I could handle that situation. My wife and daughter don't fish either but they also know what my fly-in fishing trip means to me and my sanity. Time to send the girls to a sunny beach in Florida or Mexico while you head North to Canada to do what you need to do. You've got to do it cause it's driving you crazy. I'm sure you could get at least four of your group to go. You all just need to grow some hair down there if you know what I mean.
3795801,octanehi5,2015-04-22 05:13:00,1104,"we solved that problem yrs. ago, we take a cruise or a week in aruba together, my fly in every year for the last 25 yrs. My wife says if I go fishing one more time shes going to leave me, I miss her already"
3796401,oleJoe,2015-04-22 07:29:00,114,"We will be flying into Melchett on the 22nd of May and I just packed the Lil Debbies snack cakes. I feel for you. We go every year and that is a long wait!! I got everything packed except the perishables. And now its count the days. I'll be thinking of you on the trip. We will throw back over 1500 for you to catch next year. I shouldn't say that, its a long wait. Take care"
3796697,ziggyzag,2015-04-22 08:13:00,125,OleJoe: Thanks have fun I know you will and I know the 1500 thing no joke on Melchett. OCtanehi5: You must be much better off than I am to make two vacations in one year or a new wife every other!! Draco1206: Grow some Hair!! That be nice at my age been loosing it fast. Mike: Well what can I say I thought starting and maintaining a family trip to Canada with all the young men in the family for over 30 years was being proactive and hopefully they will continue on as the years go by.
