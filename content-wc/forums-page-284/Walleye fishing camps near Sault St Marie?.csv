3803241,Shellback,2015-04-23 14:23:00,8083,I emailed Happy Day Lodge and they do have some camping spots available. I have a slide in truck camper and it might just work for us. Need to see if both our time frames will work out.
3809969,Shellback,2015-04-25 16:05:00,8083,Wrote my deposit check today. Heading there the week of July 18th.
3816265,MrSimon,2015-04-27 11:21:00,922,"Awesome! You'll have a blast. That's the same week I was there two years ago. We caught lots of fish and had a ball! As always, take bug spray!!!! The skeeters aren't bad during the day, but as soon as the sun gets below the tree tops it can be unbearable."
3821881,chris.brock,2015-04-28 17:32:00,112,"Happy Day is a great experience, but I'm pretty sure Lake St Joe would blow it away."
3823017,3M TA3,2015-04-28 22:43:00,2846,Blow what away? What Lodge? Only lodge on lake? Drive to or fly to? What about the owners? Definitely looks like it is only 3 hours from the Sault. Helps us out here Chris Brock.

3791809,Shellback,2015-04-21 08:22:00,8083,Looking for a decent Canadian camp within 2 or 3 hours of S.S.M. I'm in S.E. PA and that's about as far a drive as I'd like. It would be 16 hours from home.
3791921,Whopper,2015-04-21 08:35:00,340,"Run this by Mike Borger, I'm sure he'll have plenty of options for you"
3795489,Rich B,2015-04-21 21:48:00,1081,"Have been to this camp 3 times and it is the only camp on the large lake....clean cabins and the family who owns it runs a good camp....docks are directly in front of their cabins....they have a very good C&R program to encourage trophy fishing. It's good fishing for walleye, SM Bass and some pike....if you run a search, you'll get more info, and if you're interested in the camp, suggest you check with them for your week of choice because it has a high rebooking rate with their guests. Good luck with your travel plans this summer. Rich B"
3795681,Mike Borger,2015-04-22 03:31:00,1554,"Here's one a little outside the box: Ontario North Fishing Adventures in Oba, along the Algoma Central rail line.http://ontarionorthfishing.com/ To get there you take the train either from Sault St. Marie or Hawk Junction. That in itself is unique and gives you more fly in quality fishing for a fraction of the price. Except with no flight delays or weight limits. The cottage is incredibly nice, much nicer than your typical outfitters cabin. Boats are larger, 16' Princecraft with 35hp motors. You have access to several miles of the Oba river which in itself is good, plus direct river access to Cameron Lake which is quite large. Until this year the owners (Matt Yukich and his brother) have only offered this as a fully guided trip but will be offering this as self guided this year dropping the price even more. My feeling is you'd be hard pressed to have this same quality of fishing at any drive in camp in this region which makes it worth mentioning."
3795809,Shellback,2015-04-22 05:13:00,8083,"Ontario north looks great, but the trip will be with my wife who has MS. Not sure she could handle it. I'll have to check into it. Happy Day seems like it would be very doable for her."
3795857,Guest,2015-04-22 05:25:00,0,fellow fishermen thinking of a 2nd trip in mid july from Chicago bringing our own boat happy day resort seems like a good resort not to far a drive can we realistically catch 25 walleyes/man/day we fish hard 10 hrs/day housing keeping fishing 65% walleyes 35% northerns and smallmouths appreciate any comments or suggestions boat 17' with the latest 10 hp motor very peppy thanks jim wolf the Chicago boys
3796177,MrSimon,2015-04-22 06:50:00,922,"There is tons of info on Happy Day if you search. But to help you out, here are the answers to your questions. Yes, you can catch 25 walleye per person per day. Just do the work to nail down the pattern and maybe double that number. The smallie fishing is fantastic and the pike fishing is decent. If you only have a 10HP motor on a 17' boat, then you will be severely limited on Windermere. It is a large lake and some of the best and most scenic water is a good ways away from the lodge, especially in mid July."
3796705,adempsey,2015-04-22 08:14:00,963,"Not sure if you only wanted a drive to camp, but you can fly out of White River and Wawa which are basically within your time limit.A lot of places in Quebec too."
3796873,Mike Borger,2015-04-22 08:46:00,1554,"Happy Day is a nice lodge and one that I typically recommend myself. It's a good option - assuming they're not fully booked.I do have several contacts in this region for reasonably priced fly in trips - both outpost camps and lodges. Price wise you'd be paying a bit of a premium for a fly in for two people, but ballpark you'd be looking at $700-895 Canadian dollars for a full week per person depending on the destination. If you have any interest in this message me privately.Cheers, Mike"
3799025,adempsey,2015-04-22 16:24:00,963,"I didn't notice your reply earlier. A fly in lodge might be a better choice, but I am guessing you want to bring your boat? For a drive-in there's Camp Anjigami, but I don't know too much about it. I know one person who went to one of their fly-in outposts and had a good time. That's all I know though.Another option are the boat-in lodges on Lady Evelyn Lake - Garden Island and Island 10. They are somewhat expensive, but are full American plan and they take care of you. Lady Evelyn Lake is a beautiful lake as well. The fishing is decent, I did better there than on Windermere (which is also a very nice lake). It's probably a bit shorter drive too. Also, I contacted Happy Day/Prairie Bee not too long ago and they were booked solid. Still worth a call of course, but just passing that info along.Regardless, give Mr. Borger a call he will help you out."
