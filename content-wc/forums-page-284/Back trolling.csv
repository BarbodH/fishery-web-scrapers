3810865,Aspencreek,2015-04-25 20:39:00,2911,"X2. Particularly with a tiller. It's like a front wheel drive car, you pull instead of push. You can stay on the weed edges, stay off the boulders and don't have to worry about getting the front guy's line tangled in your prop when you are making a turn. Plus sitting at the back you can watch for those underwater hazards that are coming your way better. There is a method to the madness!!"

3814817,BornToFish,2015-04-27 05:44:00,1224,"I vastly prefer to back troll, rather than forward troll, when I am fishing any kind of structure - e.g. a depth contour line, a weed edge, a rock hump. My boat control and speed control is just that much better. Most of my forward trolling is over open water. I exclusively do one particular type of back trolling during August and September. I set the throttle and then back into the waves, so as to remain essentially stationary over a school of walleyes that are on the sides of a rock hump. I slip the boat motor into and out of reverse gear, as needed, to remain stationary and my fishing line vertical. This technique for back-trolling and vertical jigging can be hard for some folks to learn, but is absolutely deadly on walleyes as my jig + minnow is always in the strike zone. Good fishing and tight lines!!"
3815057,pjshorthorn,2015-04-27 06:30:00,5654,"This summarizes how I prefer to fish when trolling as well. Took a lot of practice to become comfortable with the technique but it is very effective. I especially agree with kicking the motor in and out of gear to hold position or facilitate a strike. I use the same method of bumping the motor into gear when forward trolling with no wind or a very light wind. I have found that many fish will bite right on the drop ( jig/lure starts to drop again as trolling speed slows down). I have also found that quite a few strikes take place on the turn when foward trolling - mostly on a rod that is pulling on the inside of the turn or straight out the stern. Although there are a number of outfitters that offer trolling motors on camp boats, I have not vistied those camps in the past. This year I have an upgraded camp boat with a trolling motor so I'll have to figure out that piece of manical machinery just like I did when backtrolling with a console wheel or a tiller. Just another part of the overall fishing experience. PjShorthorn"
3815513,southernEyes,2015-04-27 08:17:00,232,"I started backtrolling because of Canadian camp boats. We had a 16' Naden Big Laker with a huge, wind catching bow. We'd been forward trolling with no issues, when a gale blew up one afternoon. We were totally unable to control the boat heading into the wind, and were being blown everywhere going downwind. Never having done it, but having heard of it, I turned our boat backwards and put us back on the bite. In this particular spot, we'd backtroll spinners upwind, kill the engine and drift jigs downwind. Re-bait and repeat. In other spots, we'd just continuously backtroll spinners. One day it was just a jig bite, and with no anchor, I learned how to keep the boat ""anchored"" with the gas engine by bumping in and out of gear. The fish were tied to the 15' depth throughout our lake, and we needed to stay at that depth to get bit. With the transducer leading and showing the way, I knew where the boat was going before it got there and could make my adjustments in track accordingly. Most importantly, backtrolling came naturally to me. I am ""one with the boat, bait, and fish"" as my fishing buddies put it. It's true, I am tuned in when backtrolling. Second most importantly, my lure gets to the fish first when I'm driving backwards."
3816353,MrSimon,2015-04-27 11:36:00,922,"In my own boat, my electronics/trolling motor are good enough to troll going forward with excellent speed control and precision. Since the prop is in the front of the boat, there are no tangles. I see absolutely no reason to back troll. In a camp boat we either drift jigs, troll cranks (going forward), or cast lures. Depending on the wind, we can always do at least one of these. We don't backtroll. However, I can see the need for backtrolling if you want to pull spinners slowly in high winds, or if you want to jig vertically on a particular spot in high winds. I don't do either in a camp boat because, to me, it's an annoying way to fish. I don't like getting splashed with waves and I hate having to keep kicking a motor in and out of gear."
