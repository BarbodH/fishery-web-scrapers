Look for 100' or deeper, but trolling for me is just to locate. Once i find them, it's time to jig. Usually get bigger bites jigging. The fat fish don't like to chase. Often times i will cruise slow and just watch the graph. Mark a fish, stop and drop a jig. I'm sure every other trout guy will have a different opinion, but these methods have always produced for me. Good luck and enjoy your trip. I'm sure it won't be your last."
3750746,Nosebleed,2015-04-09 22:39:00,253,"Well I just booked out trip for Kississing lake in early august. This will be our first time on the lake and I'm really looking forward to exploring new water. We've been Pike fishing Northern MB for the last 10 years and I've had kississing on my to do list for a while now. I love those northern waters and it seems like the size regulations, safe release efforts, and management tactics are paying off over the last few years. Big healthy fish to be caught and re-caught up there. Kississing looks like the kind of lake that will provide several years of new adventures for me and my brother. I hope to make a few safe highway tracks across the lake to be traveled in the future. That part always stinks, time spent looking for rocks/driving really slow, instead of fishing..... Any advice on where to start and where a guy finds deep weeds in early august, or where to go or not go with a prop, would really be appreciated! We'll be getting a guide for the first day to establish a few passageways and I'm sure a couple fishing spots but when it comes to information I take all I can. We're mainly interested in pounding water for big pike but plan on trying for a few lake trout as well. I've only trolled into lake trout accidentally in the past. What are your suggestions for lures and presentations for this time of year and this area? I'll be fishing out of my alumacraft and have decent graphs so If I know what I'm looking for that would help too. Depths, structures, bottom composition, etc.... How about a lake map? Any suggestions? I can't wait for this trip. thanks for contributing to this forum everyone."
3751354,Walleye_Guru,2015-04-10 08:19:00,62,"If the habitat is anything like our neck of the woods, you want to focus on weed beds with adjacent deep water access. Remember to stay stealthy! If you're lucky to stumble onto the big ones in shallow, they won't hang around long if you come in sounding like you're banging a garbage can lid! Also, the midsummer bigg'ins in our waters tend to stay isolated. So be prepared to cover water! I like to troll when transitioning to new areas, of course only if they are in close proximity. My favorite trolling lure is a deep diving crank or reef runner. Islands too are good, especially with neck down areas that produce current Â– even the slightest current. Those big ones like to conserve energy. Some call it lazy, people who understand them call them efficient and opportunistic. Finally, go big or go home. Presentations should be big and worthy of the effort. Big pike want big meals. You've picked a good time of year. Your likely hitting the water close to peak summer temps which means their metabolisms will be in overdrive. They should be on the feed pretty consistently. Good Luck and let us know how things turned out! Look forward to it!"
3768209,red1000,2015-04-15 04:52:00,14,"as for the trout in august, look for deep holes with steep breaks. all you need for them is a jig and piece of meat (minnow, sucker belly, etc.) i've only ever fished the narrow east side of the lake, but have had great success. one easy spot is anchor to ""the tree"" in the narrows north of fire ranger island. you'll know what i mean when you see it. it's only about 50 yards wide, but will be deep. as for rocks... i wish you the best. getting out of the boat launch bay is one of your bigger challenges. the main body of the east arm should be okay if you stay in middle. shore lines are tough, and i haven't ventured into the big body of the lake at all so no advice to give there. if you love your equipment, you will hate the drive. once you leave the hiway, your gear and you will be punished. wrap your boat, and drive slow. my nitro stays home, and we use a 93' yar craft to take up there. there is a reason that kississing is manitoba's best kept secret.cheers."

3770209,KEEBOY,2015-04-15 12:23:00,61,Nosebleed. We have been going to Kississing for 20+ years now and we love it. We typically go 1st week of June but I would be willing to try and help you navigate around and let you know what we have experienced. We stay at Sharrons Outfitting. What the previous post says about the east side of the lake is where most of the lake trout fishing will be is correct. And as for the drive in 45 miles of gravel so take your time. The West side is where most people head for Pike and walleye. Lot of water there and we haven't hit it all yet. PM me and I will try and help you out.
3772681,Nosebleed,2015-04-15 23:01:00,253,thanks for the responses guys. I'll be sure to find some meat to tip trout jigs with. What kind of tackle would you use for 1-3 oz jigging? Is my Meduim heavy 7' spinning rig adiquate? I've never jigged with more than 1oz. I may drag 3way's too with heavy sinkers but that will probably be done on a linecounter.
3772737,red1000,2015-04-16 00:33:00,14,"usually 3/4 - 1oz jig is fine. i use a 7' med heavy crankbait rod with 12# mono. it's a bit of a workout when you hook a 38-40"" trout, but sure is fun. do a fair bit of 3 way rigging in june, pretty tough to get deep enough later in the year tho. good luck."
3776921,Timing,2015-04-17 08:23:00,95,"It is one intimidating lake when look at map. Take time to discuss with outfitter so know about hazards and fish locations. We had great luck for walleye and pike. Believe this, forgot flour and run into a Canadian boat and they give us bag that lasts us 2-3 meals."
3779193,Fisher-man,2015-04-17 21:40:00,422,"Its been 15 years since I last fished it. But, you will find pike....lots of pike, and some real trophy fish. It seemed to us that the walleye were concentrated on the northern section of the lake and the pike were all over. But, again, it sure seemed like we caught bigger fish the further north on the lake we went. But, that was some years ago. Great lake to fish."
3814257,Nosebleed,2015-04-26 20:50:00,253,"We will be trout fishing too for the first time any tips on what would be your go to presentation? I'm in the process of installing downriggers too so nothing's out of the question. What lures, what speeds, what jigs how to work them etc.....? Remember it'll be early August so mid-late summer patternSent from my iPhone using Tapatalk"
