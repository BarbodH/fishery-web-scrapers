My statement really refures to the yr to yr changes in depth, I fished bay du nord with Air Melincon up to the yr they sold it. One yr you could access a bay near the camps the next you had to go 3 miles around to get in. Its still a great fishery. My new home away from home is Hebert Its hard to leave a lac after you have caught over 900 in a week"
3809921,duffitdad,2015-04-25 15:56:00,21,Going to gouin last week of may - any word on ice conditions/ice out?
3815321,canyon,2015-04-27 07:48:00,37,Lots of speculation out there. Estimates of May 10 - 20th ice out. Last week of May will be no issues. Where are you staying?
3815585,Freytown,2015-04-27 08:27:00,770,https://www.facebook.com/PourvoirieChaletsBaieduSud Link is for a camp on Baie du Sud. Outfitter is there now prepping for the season so pic's are current. Looks like lots of ice is hanging around.
3815697,canyon,2015-04-27 09:02:00,37,Nice to see some current pics!
3821073,a3dad,2015-04-28 12:52:00,115,See attached satellite image of the Gouin from today. Still shows frozen (red). duffidad - I'll be up on Plamondon Bay May 31. Which bay are you on? Kevin
3821497,octanehi5,2015-04-28 15:10:00,1104,"Water moves very quickly through the gouin, those recent pics show ice with water on it. My prediction still stands that ice out will be by the 10th"
3822361,canyon,2015-04-28 19:04:00,37,So looking at the outfitters pics I can't help but think the water level is down. I have no real frame of reference as this is the first time looking at the outfitter pics. Anyone care to weight in on the level? Looks like most of the snow is melted on land.
3823257,Freytown,2015-04-29 05:01:00,770,"It does look low. I know that this location gets pounded with a south wind and the outfitter is creating a sea wall to protect his boats. Added to the problem is that shore is very rocky and the boats get beat up if in the water. Also, he appears to be raising the height which makes the lake look lower too. South baie is relative shallow and opens up early with the Oskelaneo river dumping warm spring water at the south end."
3823473,octanehi5,2015-04-29 05:54:00,1104,"looks to be a good 8' low,The water level in the gouin has always been an issue with me. it changes daily"
3823513,Freytown,2015-04-29 06:13:00,770,"Ron, I've fished the Gouin off/on for 35 yrs and daily water level changes are not noticeable. The compound is 60 miles wide (East to West) and 40 mileshigh (North to South). An old outfitter said that even with heavy river flows, one inch a day is about maximum daily change. I believe him based on my experiences. FT"
