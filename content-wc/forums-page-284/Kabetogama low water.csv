For some weird reason they want water in the river also. The main post was in regards to the Ash River Trail and the Ash River which feeds Kabetogama. It will take torrential rains to move it much (lake levels) in a couple of weeks. My bet is you start hearing about about this situation soon."
3816969,camp chef,2015-04-27 14:29:00,915,I talked to Deb at the Frontier Resort. She says she has seen the water much lower than this and that Sullivan is still passable. they have had boats up to Kettle Falls already this spring.
3818553,dutchboy,2015-04-27 19:46:00,5717,Well thats certainly good news. I replied to your PM.
3818913,Nimstug,2015-04-27 21:16:00,2605,We were at Sunset Resort last fall. Need to get back so we can meet Brian H.
3818961,dutchboy,2015-04-27 21:27:00,5717,"The photo of the crib & dock is at Sunset. Thats a new dock John is building. Ya, sorry I missed you and your wife last year. Glad you had a good trip. Where are you headed on vacation this year?"
3810673,dutchboy,2015-04-25 19:52:00,5717,Photo's taken Saturday 4-25-15
3810713,dutchboy,2015-04-25 20:00:00,5717,"My last attempt at pictures. If it doesn't work, take my word for it they need rain."
3810769,imafishslayer,2015-04-25 20:14:00,64,Now I can see what has been snagging my line all those years
3811033,REW,2015-04-25 21:24:00,40083,"Like California, much of MN is suffering a severe drought!!"
3811945,offthehook67,2015-04-26 08:18:00,2122,After speaking to a few people and resort owners up on Cass Lake and they said the water level is lower than they have seen it in years.
3812057,dutchboy,2015-04-26 08:47:00,5717,"Those familiar with the Ash River Trail know the only way out to Kabetogama by water is through Sullivan Bay. As of right now I'm not sure a boat can cross Sullivan Bay, it's only 6-7 feet deep in most spots under normal conditions. Last year the resorts battled high water, this year low water. Whats next?"
3813113,kzoofisher,2015-04-26 14:43:00,5144,"Shorelines that get exposed to air can change dramatically thanks to speeded up composting of organic material, changes that are often for the better when they are covered with water again. The short term difficulties may very well have long term benefits. Camp owners may also benefit from the opportunity to make needed repairs and improvements much more quickly, cheaply and easily than when everything is in the water. Of course, a lot depends on how long they are exposed."
3813313,dutchboy,2015-04-26 15:54:00,5717,Always a silver lining.
3814321,GBS,2015-04-26 21:06:00,2271,"Yes lower than normal at this point in the spring, but based on the Pine Aire web cam, not dramatically much lower than past years at this time. We always email everyone in our group weekly screen shots starting a couple of months out from our annual trip, so I've got a pretty good collection of water level shots going back over 10 years. Kab is a reservoir that gets lowered over the winter. Have they closed the dam yet? If so, then it's really bad...but I'm betting it will come up in the next couple of weeks."
3814593,kzoofisher,2015-04-27 04:17:00,5144,It is a silver lining even though the low water may be a PITA for some people this year. If it storms like crazy in May and June it will kind of suck for the people fishing then but be good for the later summer guys. We just have to work with the weather we get.
