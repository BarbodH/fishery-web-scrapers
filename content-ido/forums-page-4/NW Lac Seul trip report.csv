1638448,ariat,2016-09-09 08:17:00,42,Just came back Labor day from a wonderful stay at Gawleys Little Beaver Lodge!!!!!!!!!! Can’t say enough good about the camp just love it there. Thursday We fished down in Mckenzie 1 day and caught fish from 6 to 18′ fow lot of nice fish biggest being 25.5″ probably a dozen in the slot. clicker said 50 in my boat on the day lots of fun. Friday the wind switched to the South so we stuck to steamboat bay and caught lots of 15 – 16″ eyes on a few different windblown spots. 22 – 24 fow Saturday found a great spot on the calm side of the lake where the fish were stacked in 30′ all different sizes of fish up to 25″ with a couple 35″ northerns to boot. Sunday rain was coming in so Doug Gawley suggested we keep close to camp as the weather was coming in. So we tried a spot we hadn’t fished in years and did very well in 22′ to 24′ fow with biggest being 26.25″ we got a few hours in before the lightning chased us off the lake. Northern lights were booming at night as a bonus was a great trip!!!!!!!!!!!!!
