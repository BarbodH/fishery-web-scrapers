We have been there the last few years but was wondering if you could give us some insight and mostly fish in Vermilion Bay and the central area. I saw your post of your trip and how well you did and would to talk about the West arm as everyone seems to head more to Portage bay and even further to Nash Bay. Thanks! Jim"
