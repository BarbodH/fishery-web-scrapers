I’ve read that I’ll need an outdoors card and a license. Is Ontario barbless hooks? I believe it’s in zone 5 of the map that I saw, which is also highlighted as part of the boundary waters but no clue what that means or if that means anything. Any pointers or information would be appreciated for when I take my first venture over the northern border."

The ministry website has specific information on the particular body of water you will be fishing. Most are not catch and release and zone 5 covers Clearwater. I’ve fished this area 13 yrs and its a hidden gem. Sorry, white otter lake is closed until 6/14/17. But plenty of other lakes to fish."

1677719,MarkG,2017-02-28 19:48:00,5,Clearwater Lake not part of the Quetico Park..so its “not a barbless hook” lake.
1677708,MarkG,2017-02-28 19:48:00,5,I assumed you found this site: http://files.ontario.ca/environment-and-energy/fishing/2017/2017_FMZ_5_English.pdf The answer is “no barbless hooks required” since this is not part of the Quetico Provincial Park.
