It’s called the Americas Outdoor show and it will be at the Donald E. Stevens Convention Center. It replaces the old Ohare/Rosemount Show and it looks to be alot better than in was in the past 5 years. There will be alot to look at boats, seminars, fishing vacations, etc. If you are looking for a great place to find your next Canadian fishing trip, come down to the show. There have to be at least 50 booths from canada so there are alot of options to look at. If you make it down to the show, stop by and say HI – we will be in the Camp Manitou booth 324 and 326 right next to the ontario tourism booth."

They almost killed it the past few years with non outdoor persons trying to market it.I am coming back after skipping last year for the first time in about 54 years. I hope it will be worth the 300 mile trip down… I’ll try to stop and say hi~!
