Also check points of islands that drop into deep water. Are you staying at Sleepy dog cabins. If so Tom Williams the owner will give you some good info. Also, if his nephew Terry is still working for him, hire him for a half a day. He is an awsome guide. He took me over to Lac Suel for a day and we just had a blast. Beautiful lake and if the fishing is slow there its just a few miles to the boat ramp to Lac Suel. Good luck and have a good time. Brent"

Otherwise, weed edges and rocky points are great. Don’t forget to check out Keynote(they’ll show you), I guess it’s been good for walleye this year. Wabaskang is a nice piece of water–really cut up into what seems like 5 small lakes, so no matter the wind or weather there’s always someplace to work. A good selection of shallow areas and deep. Get a decent map, ask some questions and check out the toppgraphy and you’ll do fine. If you like to catch them, there are some bonus pig smallies there too. The perch run large and fat.Wife and I will be there at the end of August( ), I hope you knock ’em and have a great time! Let us know how you did!"
