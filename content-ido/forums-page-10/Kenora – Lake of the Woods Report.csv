The walleye bite was also a dream….over 100 boated by the 4 of us. We hit 4 different reef/island points throughout the day. The bite was strongest from 15-26 f.o.w. We had a great shore-lunch and released 10 fish over 22″. Fished mainly with bottom-bouncers and spinners – minnow (live or dead) or crawler (no difference in bite). Very easy to view fish on the Lowrance and target them…if you did not see fish, do not fish in the area. June 30 and July 1 brought changing weather…strong E wind, sometimes S, sometimes N. The wind added to the bite on the windward side of reefs and points…the W’s stacked up against the structure. This nice 30″ girl came off a wind-swept reef in about 18 f.o.w.. Over 150 w’s boated on June 30…and we called it a short day on the 1st due to weather and the anticipated drive back. It is an amazing fishery. After fishing a number of different Canadian resorts, the access (all paved, well marked waters with gps chip access) is the best, the bite incredible and and chance for a trophy always around the corner. Ontario still has some work to do… wish they would offer more welcome to their tax- and resort- paying visitors….but its the bite that made the trip and we will return this summer. Labvolt."
