1355214,taz,2014-03-18 05:51:00,391,Any body have any reports and lake winnipeg? How much ice? Snow depth? If the east or west side of the lake has a better bite and so on. I will be heading up Sunday to Thursday and will report back on how we do. Thanks for any info you give and I hope to have some good info to share/pics when we get back for the people who are heading up there the last weekend!
1397029,super_do,2014-03-18 06:26:00,1035,Just got back. We had tough weather and fishing last week. 2 days were in the 30’s and the other days single digits and windy. Wednesday it was -16F when we were pulling out of the driveway. Said the heck with it and went back in and watched TV for a while. My 74 year old Dad did get a 31.5″L x 19.25″G. AWESOME fish! Had a 20″ extension and powerhead was on the snow every hole. You need to keep moving. If it gets warm you will need tracks to get around.
