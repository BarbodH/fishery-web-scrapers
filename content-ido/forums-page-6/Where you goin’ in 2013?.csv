1123910,wally1992,2012-12-26 15:10:00,278,The Boys and i will be heading to the English River. fishinf for Eyes and Northern. Will be enjoying the vast beauty of the landscape from Maynard falls to Seperation Lake. I just love it. The boys have to be 12 yrs old before they can go and Boy # 4 gets to go this year. he has heard many fish stories from his older siblings and the anticipation is building as we chat. The area always seems to rise to meet all expectations.

Looking for the good and bad compared to staying at a cabin or lodge. We did a fly-in last year to a lodge but didn’t like being tied to the lodges meal schedule, we want to be more on our own this time around."
