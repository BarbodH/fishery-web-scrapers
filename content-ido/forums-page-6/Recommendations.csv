1355212,meestro,2014-03-01 11:02:00,136,I am just a few hours south of the Canadian/Minnesota border and would like to drive up to a resort on a lake that is quiet with good fishing. I like to bring my own stuff and I fish all major species walleye/northern/muskie/bass. Any recommendations with reasonable accommodations? I am new to the Canada thing.

Very remote, I think it was 26 miles by boat to get to the resort. It is what they call a fishing camp and rustic. Not what you would call a 5 star but very comfortable. We fished for walleyes and pike. They do have lakers also. Not sure about the other fish you mention. We caught tons of fish and virtually never saw another boat. Very nice trip. IMHO"

Terry at resort will help you with spots. Negative, boat has to be trailered every night. Cabins are good and reasonably priced. Rustic.Press lake camp north of Ignace. Walleye, pike and smallies. Electric right on docks and cabins are good and reasonably priced. Rustic. Negative – road in to camp is 16 miles of logging road that takes us an hour to navigate pulling my Mr. Pike. Give them a look and good luck!"

You stay on an island in little traverse bay and rarely run into any other boats. It may seem like an expensive trip but all you do is eat, sleep, and fish, seriously. They cook all meals, clean all fish, and provide bait and 6 gallons of gas a day if you take your own boat. HIGHLY recommend!!!"
