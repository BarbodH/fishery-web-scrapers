1852726,fishthumper,2019-04-24 11:14:00,8288,I’m trying to find the current ice conditions or ice out dates for a area in Canada. I cant seem to find anything on the net. The area I’m looking for Info. on is know as the Pas area. We have a trip planned to Reed lake the 1st week in June. I was hoping for a late ice out there this year. It doesn’t look like I’ll get my wish. The closer to ice out the better the fishing. We moved the trip up a week earlier this year. You have to be a bit carful to not plan it to early. One year the ice did not go off the lake till early June. If anyone know where I can find some data or knows the current condition – Let me know.

We settled on the second week of June, but sometimes that was too late. If we would hit it right, you could catch walleyes, Northerns, and Lake Trout all in 10 FOW or less along the shores."
1852981,fishthumper,2019-04-25 15:14:00,8288,Yep. That is what we are hoping for. I really like the Bonus that the lake trout add. I just hope that the ice out there is later this year than it was last.

We don’t typically target them much up there, but I had the itch one day, so I put eight 2 ounce bottom bouncers on a three way and ran a 8 foot leader back to a spoon and caught them. it wasn’t pretty, but it worked:)"
