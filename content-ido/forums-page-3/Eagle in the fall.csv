We were there for a week in August at a resort more in the central part of the lake but my understanding was that structure and habitat was similar on that lake from end to end. Hundreds of bays and islands, rock and weeds. I would think Vermilion bay would be as good for pike and muskie as anywhere else out there. My buddy and I spent about half our time casting for muskie and one 55″ was caught the week we were there…just not in our boat. Pike were common with a few nice one’s caught. Lot’s of small “gray ghosts” in that lake too."
