1710821,Dream’n,2017-08-18 10:54:00,371,My family wants to do a fly in for a 60th birthday near the end of July next year. Primarily will be walleye fishing. As a rule is it that much better fishing vs say driving to Lac Seul or another Canadian lake? Any suggestions? Thanks Bob.
1710830,philtickelson,2017-08-18 11:25:00,1678,"Lac Seul seems like it can be the best of both worlds, but also bigger water(and more fishermen). A lot of the fly in options offer smaller more wind-protected lakes where numbers of walleye will be fantastic. Is your group more interested in numbers or size? IMO, if you are after a trophy you should head to bigger bodies of water up there(Lake St. Joseph, Lac Seul, etc.). If you want numbers, there’s tons of fly-ins that you can go and catch 15-20″ fish until your heart is content(with usually some mid-20s fish mixed in). I’ve fished Lake Carling and Raggedwood Lake through Winoga lodge and we caught hundreds and hundreds of walleyes. I didn’t count the total number of fish but my buddy and I had over 100 doubles in 5 days on Raggedwood. Biggest fish was ~25″ on both lakes. Carling has some smaller lake trout too which is kind of cool. That’s not to say you can’t catch a trophy on some of those smaller lakes, but I just think your odds are better on the big water. Of course, your odds of being stuck in the cabine while the wind howls goes up as well."

Good outfit if you want to do a fly in. Note that they don’t outfit you at the cabins….on your own for the time you stay there. Great time to fish and spend time with the family completely disconnected from others.
