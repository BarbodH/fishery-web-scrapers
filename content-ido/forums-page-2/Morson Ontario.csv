1184276,fisherman-j,2013-07-18 19:19:00,323,"Humps/reefs and islands will hold walleyes this time of year. Most troll bottom bouncers with spinners and either crawlers, minnows or plastics. Jigs and minnows/crawlers/plastics will also work, too. Active fish will hold anywhere from 10 – 25 feet. After dinner/early evening, casting and trolling cranks in about 8 feet can work really well. I wouldn’t bother fishing after the sun sets. Make sure you have the Canadian nav maps for the area. Take a good look at some of the humps/reefs in the area – and most will hold fish. I would also fish the reefs/humps out from and in between Dawson channel, Gooseneck and Harbor Island (they form a triangle on a map) – fish any of these."
1186068,ariat,2013-07-27 22:45:00,42,"Just got back home today from first nation guides outpost on sabaskong bay. Nice cabin beautiful scenery, however the walleye fishing proved to be pretty tough. We traveled as far north and west as stairway point. We used a clicker and caught an average of 25 walleyes a day for 3 of us. 23″ being the biggest with a a couple 22″, 1 – 21″ 6 – 20″ all the way down to a fingerling. We found our best fishing in miles bay 20 to 25 FOW. Went through a flat of crawlers pulling spinner rigs. We finally got a leech bite going yesterday with 16th oz Jigs tipped with some nice leeches from gills in morson. The highlight of the trip for me was hooking 2 different muskies and having 2 other follow ups. All over 45″ fish and I am no Musky fisherman example is I don’t even own a bucktail had to borrow one from my brother in law.. haha Also we got pulled over by the CO for a spotcheck and that was a very pleasant experience as he was very nice and happy to answer any questions we had. We did try a bunch of reefs, however we only caught a handful of eyes on them and we didn’t really mark any fish on them either. We even fished a couple reefs that are not mapped ——————————————————————————–catch and release Top"
1717283,Wesley Trebesch,2017-09-26 14:06:00,44,Pulling up an old thread here….. Anyone been in this area recently? Reports?
1717286,snelson223,2017-09-26 14:24:00,421,I was up there about 2 weeks ago. Stayed out on Alexandria Island. Fishing was ok. Caught bigger fish pulling cranks. The weather wasn’t the best. Was 80 the day before we got there then went down into the 40s with rain and wind.
1717290,Wesley Trebesch,2017-09-26 14:39:00,44,Find any crappies?
1717292,snelson223,2017-09-26 14:54:00,421,We stumbled across 2 of them in 22′. Most of the walleyes were found shallow. Some in less than 5′. 20170914_171704.jpg
1717296,Wesley Trebesch,2017-09-26 15:15:00,44,Nice job! We went up this same weekend last year and didn’t find any crappie. Hoping we can snag a few this year.
1717305,Loomis13,2017-09-26 15:56:00,91,Love Reel em inn!! We go up in August and June. Really want to make a sept/oct. trip but my dad teaches school and Im in school so that doesnt work
1717784,Wesley Trebesch,2017-09-29 08:26:00,44,Weather not looking too favorable for Sunday(our only full day of fishing) with upwards of 15mph winds. Hopefully they miss on that one……
1717801,philtickelson,2017-09-29 09:41:00,1678,"That part of the lake is a whole different animal than the MN side so this might not apply, but we’ve normally caught more walleye by fishing a bit off the reefs, not directly on them. That might be obvious, but just wanted to point out when we talk about ‘fishing the reefs’ we are usually jigging in the mud adjacent to the reefs, at times hundreds of yards off the reefs themselves."
1718559,Wesley Trebesch,2017-10-03 14:46:00,44,"Got home yesterday afternoon. Tough weekend for us. Made it up late morning Saturday. Got unpacked into the cabin, ate a sandwich, and headed out for the afternoon. Saturday was windy but not unmanageable. We were able to make a decent run and we caught fish just about everywhere we went. We were able to eat walleye for dinner and put three in the freezer as well. Sunday was crazy windy and rainy on and off all day. It didn’t look that bad when we woke up but by the time we got out on the bigger water we realized how rough it really was. We still caught fish but we had to work pretty hard to get them. We tried to fish in the wind a bit but it wears on us after while. We were able to catch some fish on the protected sides of islands it was just nice to be out of the wind even momentarily. Still made our daily limits but it was a lot of work. We were going to try to go fish yesterday in the morning for a couple hours before heading home but it was raining pretty steadily again so we just pulled the boat and decided to head home. Especially after being pretty well soaked all day Sunday we just called it a trip. We caught decent numbers Saturday and I thought we did ok Sunday given the conditions. We just didn’t see very much size at all. Biggest fish was 19″(caught on a jigging rap). We saw tons of 8″-12″ fish. Caught one lonely crappie(13″) and one lonely perch(I had one get off at the side of the boat that looked like a keeper as well). Best depth was probably 18-24′, but we caught fish in a variety of depths. Minnows and crawlers seemed to fish pretty even to me."
1798875,Wesley Trebesch,2018-09-21 13:21:00,44,Any recent reports?
1798904,snelson223,2018-09-21 18:07:00,421,Just came back from there on Monday. Most of our fish came from mud. Not much on the reefs. Pink and red smile blades and gold shiner butterfly blades were best. We caught fish anywhere from 3ft to 20. We stayed at Reel em lodge. Best fishing was close to the island.
1799637,Wesley Trebesch,2018-09-25 12:26:00,44,Were you able to locate any crappies?
1864598,Wesley Trebesch,2019-06-27 11:58:00,44,Heading up two weeks from today. Any reports from the Morson area?
1864652,asch,2019-06-27 16:04:00,149,"We were up at Mylie’s Place last week. They weren’t on the humps yet. The water temp was 61 all week. They were on islands and points. Jigs and minnows worked better than bait walkers and lindy rigs. Ring worms worked better than night crawlers. Any color worked as long as it was gold. We caught a lot of walleyes, the biggest was 28″, and the fewest crappies, perch, and small mouth than in the last 4 years."
1865550,Wesley Trebesch,2019-07-02 14:22:00,44,Thanks for the report!
