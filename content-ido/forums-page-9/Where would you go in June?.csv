1218432,trapsht,2011-01-19 00:57:00,311,"Here’s my scenario..what’s your opinion??I’m looking for a 1 week drive to Canadian trip the 1st week of June for 2 guys. Looking to spend less than $1000pp. I can bring my own boat or rent. Targeting the typical walleye/Northern. Catching 80 walleye/day that are all 14-16″ for the entire week doesn’t really get my blood boiling. I’d like a lake that has trophy potential. My list thus far is Pasha,Lac Seul,North Star Lodge(Clay L.) I’ve been to Pasha a few times within the last couple years and have caught a pile of fish and I’m going back in August for a bear hunt/fishing combo. I’m on board to go again in June, but my buddy doesn’t want to drive to the lake everyday  I guess it’s his vacation too. So what do you all think for an early June trip..do you like my choices or do have lakes to add?"
927663,joejingle,2011-01-19 01:06:00,25,"You might look at Bull Shoals in Arkansas, Huge walleye, White River is near by (trout) and Lake Norfork, Walleye, Striper and large crappie"
927664,fish4blue,2011-01-19 01:11:00,162,"Our group usually heads to LOW on the Canadian side. With all the Canadian Shows and boat shows, now is the time for the both of you to look at some of them and see what each really wants in theis trip. *Remember you are stuck with each other for a week*"
927665,poppy402,2011-01-19 01:20:00,948,Lac Seul is tough to beat! I have heard good things about pasha too but havent been there. I have been to lac seul 3 times and 120 walleye days pp is common with alot in the 19 to 23 inch range with 26 plus’s seen every day.
927667,targaman,2011-01-19 01:27:00,2759,"Hey trapsht, do you own that nice looking Tuffy I see in Norwalk parked on Main street sometimes?"
927683,up man,2011-01-19 02:35:00,305,I second that! I have been to Lac Seul also. Around 100 walleyes a day with alot between 20-26
927793,arklite881south,2011-01-19 14:23:00,5660,"Rainy Lake  I had to check back through our pics from last June to see if it was a good time. Didn’t make it through June 5th before pic allotment was full. Seriously pal Lots of options!! I’ve also fished most of the fisheries mentioned. Chad has a wonderful place at Pasha and I assure you WE’LL BE BACK!! Most importantly have a great time and load up your rods with heavy fish!! last year by Mid-June we had already landed 42 pike over 10lbs!! And between the Rainy River run and from the Lake opener to mid June simply an unbelievable # of walleyes over 27 inches to post. I will say over 100 is a very modest estimate. Not to mention freak smallies and possibly timing the slab bite JUST RIGHT!!           <img src=""/wp-content/uploads/bbu_images/fishing/post_images/1295446515_DSCF0047-Copy.JP"
927799,John Peterson,2011-01-19 14:36:00,331,I would recommend Rainy Lake either the U.S. or Canadian side. 
927840,trapsht,2011-01-19 15:53:00,311, I actually live in Illinois now…guess I better update my info Chris…you’re like a bad penny  When I start to get it narrowed down you have to put up pics of those pigs. This is a no lose decision.
927890,arklite881south,2011-01-19 16:49:00,5660,The Penny appears to be “Heads Up”.
928106,Chad Thompson,2011-01-19 22:54:00,325,Chris – Stop all ready! It’s to early to be posting pics like that… not with a good 4 months to go before ice out.
928120,arklite881south,2011-01-19 23:22:00,5660,
928041,trapsht,2011-01-20 01:09:00,311,Good looking guy holding up those fish..huh?
928068,Chad Thompson,2011-01-20 01:11:00,325,I suppose if you compare him to the walleye 
948361,timmy,2011-03-18 12:23:00,1960,"For my money – I would stay on the MN side of Rainy…..excellent fishing, incredible scenery, and not in Ontario….. From my experiences, Ontario is not really welcoming to tourists. Restrictive rules and tough enforcement make for a vacation that is not as relaxing to me. I enjoy having a cold beer in my boat and not having to worry that I might be breaking some unknown minor law that could get me into hot water. There are signficant $$ savings in staying this side of the border. If Canada is on your ‘must do’ list for this vacation, I would highly recommend the western side of LOTW – Buffalo Bay. Manitoba waters allow for 6 walleyes kept, the people are friendly, and the numbers of big fish are there. Personally, Manitoba has Ontario beat hands down as far as being a nice get-a-way for me, but your mileage may vary…… T"
