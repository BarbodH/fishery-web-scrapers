In order to qualify for the tax rebate you need to have the following: – all inclusive package or tour: This is your typical Fishing Package that includes Cabin, boat & motor, fuel, bait ect. – and you need to have been provided a service: This can be a guide service, fish cleaning service ect. Talk to your outfitter for more details. You can download the application from http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pbg/gf/gst115/README.html Remember, you are applying as an individual and can get upto 50% back of the HST tax you paid during your stay.
