1218444,silverstreak,2011-05-27 10:40:00,250,Was wondering what the avg price of bait was in the canadian resorts. Going the middle of june and was going to take crawlers but if their bait is priced affordable then I don;t have to worry about it. Thanks

Many outfitters have to buy bait whole sale which is really expensive right now. If you are lucky enough to go with an outfitter that has their own bait harvest area, they are generally cheaper / dozen and liberal with the amount of minnows they’ll give you."
