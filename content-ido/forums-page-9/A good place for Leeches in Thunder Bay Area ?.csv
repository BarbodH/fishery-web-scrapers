Any suggestions as to where we can get good quality and pricing for a pound or 2, without going much out of our way, will be much appreciated."

We are 5 mins north on Road 801 between Beardmore and Jellicoe. If you are in a huge hurry, we can meet you at the intersection of HWY 11 and 801 and give them to you there. Let me know. Thanks Chad"
