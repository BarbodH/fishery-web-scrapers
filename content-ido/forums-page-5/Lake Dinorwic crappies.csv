1611772,31lifer,2016-04-05 18:16:00,152,I will be on Lake Minnataki from June 11th thru the 18th and I saw a Jason Mitchell program which featured giant crappies on Lake Dinorwic. I will be about a half hour north of there and I am wondering if I should take a day and go hunt for those hogs? Has anyone fished this lake in June and located these big crappies. It would be great for my wife and daughters to experience this. Any tips would be appreciated.
