Lake Nipigon, and Pasha, are roughly 500 miles from him. Safe bet will be ice free the first week in May? What’s everyone seeing?"

We have ice in most places, yet one of my first open water venues to the 35 miles to my south is getting very close as the center of the river is open, just waiting for the North side to open where the first landing is located!!! Also if we can get the harbor open at Saxon, we could be on da Big lake in a week or so also. I did get out on the WI River north of Lake Wisconsin and managed my sauger in a long time last Sat. as well… Hear of a number of places in the area and especially to the West where the ice is getting dangerously thin.
