You can do some homework pre trip! Also I like how they’ll get food for you if your traveling long distance. They probably got the food dialed in for the weight restrictions on the air craft. Looks like a good spot! Let us know how you do!

My pops and his best friend hit Tesup Lake (~50 air miles from Ft. Francis, still in the Rainy Lake watershed) every year now and I am going with them this year for my bachelor party. NWO is good people and my dad and his friend rave about how well they treat them. The food package is not only convenient, but a pretty good deal too. Cabin and amenities were good. Boats ran fine. They like 14-16’ers w/6hp Yammies, so you aren’t getting anywhere fast. I can attest that the fishing when I went twice to Carillon Lake, was fast and furious and just not may big fish – walleyes or pike. The pictures they bring home from Tesup Lake usually include walleyes and pike that spark my interest. I fish out of Port Clinton, OH on Erie, Linwood, MI on Saginaw Bay, and I live in Metro D, so I’m spoiled with the Detroit River close to home as well. I like big fish. Bring your own electronics if you want, they can make a difference. I certainly did better NOT using live bait on Carrilon Lake in the past. I’ll let yo uknow if that is the case on Tesup at the beginning of June when I get back. Dad claims he has to have live bait some days, but he did at Carillon too… For the price, convenience, and seclusion, they are a great option."
