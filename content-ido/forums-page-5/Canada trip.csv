Body of water is part of the river system so most fish flock to the river inlet during the spring, and when we arrived Sunday the water temp was 60° and I had a hunch the big girls already had flocked out to the main body, which turned out to be right unfotanutely. Couldnt manage anything over 25″ for eyes, and didn’t try for big Pike, but got some nice 32-36″ while bottom bouncing. Bigger fish were found on the inside turns of main lake feeding flats about 20-25′, with a few caught on slip bobbers with leeches on the top of the bars at sunset in 10-15′. Wind swept or not didnt seem to matter that much, every single fish we caught was fat as ell, there is a lot of forage this year and their bellies were stuffed. Fun trip, blue and white jointed rapala was the hot lure for walleyes, and the northern were gobbling up anything orange."
