1570109,doorman,2015-10-10 23:20:00,25,"Took a gamble fishing the largest lake in Ontario in October. Got lucky! Low wind and 50 to 60 deg. Temps. Started shallow and only found small Pike. Great for the frying pan but I was looking for some trophy’s. We decided to try rocks, same. Deep weeds, Bingo! The further of shore the better. Found a cabage and coontail bed on a huge Sand flat 200 yards off shore during a good wind and got 5 over 40 biggest 47. IMG_3220.jpg IMG_3260.jpg IMG_3226.jpg IMG_3247.jpg"
