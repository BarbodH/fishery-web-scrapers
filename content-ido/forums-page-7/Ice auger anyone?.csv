We’ve seen the ice go out on inland lakes no later than May 10th in the latest year (2008ish), followed soon by Nipigon. Having said that, I will keep you updated regularly on ice conditions so that we can adjust accordingly if need be.” One thing I can say for sure is that ice conditions, although thick, it’s more gray, honeycombed ice than anything. Once the snow melts, things should start to go quickly. I’ll keep everyone posted on conditions on our latitude."

1164842,Chad Thompson,2013-04-22 18:44:00,325,Sorry DaveB – my typo should be fixed now… if not let me know. Thanks Chad
