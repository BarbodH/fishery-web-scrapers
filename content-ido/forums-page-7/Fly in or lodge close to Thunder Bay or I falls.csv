Walleye, smallies and pike would be nice. Looking at fishing 4 days or 5 days max. We are not looking to do it on the cheap. Comfortable accommodations, nice boats with depth finders (gps?) and great food are a must. fly in or lodge. Any recommendations would be appreciated. I can PM my physical address for brochures or email to [email protected]Thank you"
