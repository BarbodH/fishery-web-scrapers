I’d assume that things are a little behind schedule right now as far as water temps and weed growth, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing… Hope you guys do well and get into some fish! Have you fished up there a bunch before?? Do you fish mostly NW bay, or do you get up to Ash or Alexandria at all? Or main lake portions? I’d assume it would be mostly shallow post spawn stuff right now, and more transition stuff when we get up there in a few weeks… Anyway, best of luck. Let us know how you did when you get back!"

Would imagine that most lakes on our parallel and just north of us are ice off as well. Great day of fishing Saturday… rivers are 45 degrees and walleyes are spawned out. Will post pics as they come in"
