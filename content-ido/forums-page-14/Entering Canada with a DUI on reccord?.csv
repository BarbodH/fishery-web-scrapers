564682,john23,2007-04-25 21:17:00,2488,"From the Mpls Star Tribune a while back: Does Canada refuse entry to a person with a DWI on their driving record? I have friends who have DWIs and they weren’t allowed in. Others were, but had to pay $180. Some claim that if the DWI is over 10 years old, it no longer matters. Which is true? Canada has a whole different view of driving while intoxicated (DWI), said Gerald Foley, political relations and public affairs manager for the Canadian Consulate in Minneapolis. In Canada, DWI is a very serious affair. It’s considered a felony. Basically, anyone with a criminal record may be refused entry into Canada. Those convicted of DWI are considered “members of an inadmissible class.” “Some drinkers and former drinkers may be offended by this,” Foley said, “but that’s the law.” There are some exceptions to their exclusion, such as:> If five years have passed since the end of the sentence imposed for the DWI offense, a person can apply for “Approval of Rehabilitation.” If approved, the inadmissibility status arising from the DWI no longer holds.> If less than five years have passed, or if the person is seeking a single or limited-time visit, he or she can apply for a Temporary Resident Permit.> With a single DWI more than 10 years ago, a person could be “deemed rehabilitated’ and could enter Canada without obtaining a permit. It must be a single conviction only Contact a Canadian Consulate or Embassy to verify your status. Go to http://canadianembassy.org/immigration/inadmissible-en.aspApplications for Approval to Rehabilitation and Temporary Resident Permit are subject to nonrefundable processing fees. If an application is refused, the fee will not be refunded. Forms are available at a Canadian Consulate or Embassy."

I wont quote any canadian law, but I can tell you my opinions backed by 25 years of Ontario fishing experience. If you are an American citizen and have a DUI or any other offense on your record, they do not have to let you in to their Country. That is not to say that if you have a DUI, that you will be denied entry. There are Pardon apllications and other ways to get around this. They cost money and you are not guarenteed entry with a completed form. It is my opinion that all this does is attract attention to your self.  The best way to go about entering Canada is to be polite and answer all of the questions that the border patrol agent asks you. You may be spot checked. If this is the case, do not have anything hidded that you do not want found. This will pretty much put an end to your trip. Most of the time, the agent will ask you for your ID. He will ask you questions regarding your business in Canada, how long you plan on being in country etc…., Answer them honestly and don’t act nervous. Remember, Sport fishing is a huge industry in northwest Ontario. American money helps this economy. They do not want to deny you access just because you have made a mistake in the past. What the Canadians do not want is any trouble makers crossing their border. If you have ever seen the line of cars crossing between Intl Falls MN and Fort Francis Ont on any Late May, early June weekend, then you will know what the border patroll agents have to deal with. Be respectful and you will have no problems, Be a smart [censored] and you will find your self fishing the Wisconsin River that afternoon. P.S If you do make it up there, Try Labatts Maximum Ice…Its good Stuff"

564762,ggoody,2007-04-26 00:01:00,2603,"Information for Non-residents with Minor Criminality Offenses (includes DUI/DWI) On June 28th Bill C11 will change the rules around rehabilitation for non-residents entering Canada who have minor criminal offenses in their past. As it is now, a guest with a minor offense on their record (no matter how long ago) must be rehabilitated or apply for a temporary 30 day entry to enter Canada. Rehabilitation can be handled through the Canadian Immigration offices in Fort Frances or Thunder Bay, as the processing times will be much slower at the Consulate (18 months and up). The offense must be more than 5 years old to rehabilitate. The 30 day pass is handled only at the port of entry, is for persons with offenses less than 5 years ago, and cannot be processed in advance. It is recommended that these persons call the Fort Frances office, prior to travel, and they will be given an indication of the likelihood of their admittance to Canada. Both rehabilitation and processing of 30 day temporary entries have an administrative fee of $200 CDN. After June 28th, if the offense is older than 10 years it will be deemed to be rehabilitated. If it is between 5 and 10 years it can be rehabilitated by obtaining the forms and following the enclosed instructions. There is no charge for offenses under 5 years. The decision of admissibility is still up to the border officer on offenses under 5 years, but the chances are good for entry if they have only one offense, have called ahead, have a reservation at a resort, and have proof of that reservation with them (i.e. Confirmation letter). The guest should be told to be truthful and the information complete. They would have to pay $200 CDN administrative fee. In all cases your guests should be told to handle themselves professionally and use good manners. The hours of operation for the immigration office at the border are as follows. Fort Frances is 7 days a week, 16 hours a day. (8 a.m. to midnight) Rainy River is 5 days a week, 8 hours a day (Times???) For further information contact:Canada Immigration Centre in Fort Frances (807) 274-3818 or Thunder Bay (807) 624-2158"

And yes, don’t act nervous. These agents stare right through you! it’s almost a little freaky."
577689,uffdapete,2007-06-04 16:54:00,394,"It is usually a hassle and also inconsistent from one agent to another. I cross frequently for all kinds of reasons and rarely have a problem but don’t have a DUI either. I use to deliver building materials across and brought horse feed back and dealt with different agents on both sides who had a different ideas about a whole range of things. A friend of mine with a DUI on his record was finally cleared with the “rehabilitation” thing but it wasn’t fun. The best advice was already posted. Cooperate, be polite, bring a good attitude and don’t even think of hiding anything. Sure a few people cross with some sort of contraband but when caught it’ll ruin their day….. at the least. Here’s a phone no. if you want to call: (807) 274-3655But again when you talk to an agent face to face you might get a different answer."
