609771,t-ellis,2007-09-20 19:31:00,1316,My Dad and I went last year the first week of Oct and the best advice is for numbers hit the “lake” portion and for size hit the “river” section in Nippawin. On the lake portion we fished breakline and rock piles in 25′-35′ of water pulling bouncers and spinners with great success. Good luck!! If you fish the “lake” make sure to keep an eye out for deadhead logs floating since they will ruin a vacation in a hurry.
609825,sliderfishn,2007-09-20 22:53:00,5428, That report will read: No Walleyes in that stinking river. At least there are no fish where I am going to send you
