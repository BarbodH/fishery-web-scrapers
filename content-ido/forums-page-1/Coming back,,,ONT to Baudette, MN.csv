Last year, when we returned to the border headed south, we were forced to dump the balance of the unused crawlers. For those of you who have made the similar trip this year, what has been your experience?"

2212021,CaptainMusky,2023-07-05 09:01:00,13428,You cannot bring bait into the us you didn’t buy here. Since you cannot bring bait into Canada you cannot bring them back.
