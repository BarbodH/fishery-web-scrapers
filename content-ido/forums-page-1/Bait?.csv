2206507,Weekender,2023-06-04 10:21:00,430,I’ve heard some requirements have gone away this year. How about live bait? Still cannot bring any across the border into Ontario?
2206528,Ryan Speers,2023-06-04 14:33:00,401,"Still can not bring any live bait across the border. I asked if he thought crawlers would ever be allowed again, he said no. On a related note, I’ve been going to Ontario one or twice a year for the last 6 years and got asked this year if my boat has been dry for 6-8 weeks. I was honest and said no. He proceeded to tell me that is a new requirement. I asked him if he was joking because no serious fisherman would have their boat out of the water for 6-8 weeks!"
2206595,rjthehunter,2023-06-05 09:07:00,1231,That’s ridiculous… Did they let you through? I don’t see the purpose. Unless they’re trying to force anyone from the states to use a guide.
2206600,Ryan Speers,2023-06-05 09:20:00,401,"Yeah, he let us through. Fishing was fantastic!"
2208839,Weekender,2023-06-19 09:22:00,430,Thanks guys. We’ll order our crawlers in Fort Frances then.
2210828,Gregg Gunter,2023-06-28 14:01:00,552,"I got an email from Ontario about AIS best practices. They say 5-30 days of drying. There’s no way that 6-8 weeks is doable, unless it’s your first trip of the year. But Border Control seems to be able to make it hard for US citizens if they want. IMG_3105-1.png IMG_3104-1.png"
