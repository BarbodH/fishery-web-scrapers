1218358,Chad Thompson,2009-03-20 15:07:00,325,What is the biggest question you have about fishing MONSTER Canadian pike just after ice out?
760787,jeremy-liebig,2009-03-20 17:58:00,1455,Are you using smaller profile baits early or typical Muskie size baits while targeting these pike?
760802,Calvin Svihel,2009-03-20 18:32:00,3862,Was that fish caught on Teapot lake?? Welcome to IDO Chad…
760816,James Holst,2009-03-20 19:15:00,18922," Couldn’t be. How would you get a boat that size back in there? Welcome to the site, Chad. You have one beautiful playground up there and look forward to your pics and information from the area. As for my questions regarding ice out pike… are you typically using artificials or is dead bait, like smelt or suckers, the way to go for the bigger fish?"

760920,Chad Thompson,2009-03-21 00:24:00,325,"Hi Calvin – Good to hear from you. This one was landed on the far east end of Beatty… can’t remember if you fished LK Trout with us there or not??? Anyway, we call it “The Bay of Pigs”… very special ice out pike fishing… VERY SPECIAL! Hope you make it back this summer with James…"
760955,James Holst,2009-03-21 02:09:00,18922, TheGuN Cool presentation. I can think of a number of situations where this work very well. A question though… what type of line are you using? Any kind of leader material down to the hook or are you able to get by without a leader?
761014,Chad Thompson,2009-03-21 13:12:00,325,"James to answer your question… I use a bit of an unorthodox method when it comes to fishing big pike. Unusual method yes, yet my 5 year old son (who was 4 at the time) and I have found it to be an extremely effective technique. Next time you see him, he’ll tell you all about his 14lbs pike at the culvert! I use a 1oz jig, sliver eye, flat faced jig and the biggest sucker minnow I get in my traps. The weight of the jig let’s me stay stealthy, far enough away from spooky pike laying in ambush, yet allows me the accuracy to be able to pitch the presentation from long distances. Other big minnows work well, but I like sucker minnows for a few reasons. 1)	They are hardy. The cartilage around their neck and head allow me to hook the minnow in such away that I can endlessly cast it until either I catch a fish or am picked off by a pike more educated than me. Hardiness also allows me to aggressively twitch, snap and jig the jig without worry of tearing the flesh of the bait and ultimately loosing the jig to presentation techniques rather than a fish. 2)	Natural forage. Many lures (both artificial and natural) work and work well. But, call it a mind play, call it a confidence issue, call it what you want, but for me, personally, having that live bait at the end of my hook instills a confidence. Knowing that I am mimicking one of the most natural and strike inducing forages for large, hungry females, allows me to cast with an almost swagger like attitude. This was never more evident than when I went toe to toe with the “old man” last summer. He used his spoons, I used my big jig and bigger minnow. Now, out of respect for the guy who taught me most everything I know, I’ll prematurely end my comments here… 3)	Teaching Aids. I am fortunate enough to be able to frequently fish with my closest fishing buddy, my 5 year son. I find using the bigger tackle and bigger minnows a great teaching tool. When he can reach in the minnow bucket, grab his own minnow and then have the dexterity to put it on a big hook, you can see the light bulbs start to pop off in his head. He makes the connections, and more importantly, he gains the confidence that will instill a successful attitude when out on the water. BOOM, the fishing fever has survived yet another generation… Well, there you have it. A long drawn out answer for fishing big pike. Now I’ll have to admit that I haven’t used this technique in the spring yet. Spring time for the lodge owner life is quite busy when it comes to prepping equipment and getting camp ready. My guess though, is that if this technique works well for big pike in the heat of the summer, why wouldn’t it work for big pike in the cool of the spring???? I guess that means only one thing, I will be pitching 1oz jigs and big suckers minnows in a few short weeks, probably 3 to be exact."
