781084,moler02,2009-06-23 17:53:00,525,One is it.
786084,chrossa,2009-06-23 19:56:00,111,In Ontario you are allowed two rods unless they changed it this year.
786134,gno,2009-06-23 23:42:00,4,"Chrossa – You can only fish with one line during the openwater, it is two lines on the hardwater. It has been that way for a very long time, as long as I can remember."
786182,whittsend,2009-06-24 03:07:00,2389,"looks like one rod per person, based on the online regs that I found today… Unless I’m missing some sort of special lac seul allowance or something… Mike"
