It’s a stained water lake with riverine features, plenty of weed beds, very fertile. The lodging was great, equipment worked fine, just a great overall trip. The only complaint would be with the average size walleye. Of course we had high sun and no wind all the days were were there, so I’m not sure our trip is a good measure of this lake’s potential. I’ve certainly paid a lot more for fly in trips and caught a lot fewer fish. This is a drive to place, but they are the only outfitter on the lake. A skilled angler who didn’t have to drag a novice wife around could expect 40-80 fish days. My best fish was a 40+ inch northern and several 17-20″ eyes. Biggest eye of the trip was 25 inches. Like I said, a numbers trip."
