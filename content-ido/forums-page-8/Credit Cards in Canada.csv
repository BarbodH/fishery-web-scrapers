We’ve had several guests have their cards shut down for suspicious looking transactions when in fact they are just using their card out of country. As you can imagine, it can be a big surprise when you go to purchase gas and your card is rejected."
1085050,big_g,2012-07-17 21:16:00,20604,Good advice. Happened to me about 4 years ago… now I call a week ahead of time and good to go  Luckily there was 4 of us as I only have a Cabelas VISA… my brother in law got some of my points on that trip…
1085063,onestout,2012-07-17 21:38:00,2556,"I know, it’s a bunch of bs. I’ve had mine locked just going to SD. I also hate having to enter my zip every time I want gas."
1085074,kurt-turner,2012-07-17 21:55:00,691,"Can’t you simply phone your CC company and alert them? Or is there no phone service that far up nort? I had this happen in Austria, Switzerland and Costa Rica. A 2 minute call and all was well after positive ID… Kaching, kaching – so easy to burn thru money using plastic… oh wait, i earned more cabela’s bucks, LOL!"
1085080,Biggill,2012-07-17 22:15:00,10640, I bet it’s a bunch of bs when your card really gets stolen and a bunch of charges you didn’t make end up on your bill. In the past I’d receive a phone call about suspicious purchases like several gas purchases in one day. They are just trying to protect themselves from fraud that they are required to cover to protect their customers.
1085091,drew-evans,2012-07-17 22:41:00,1099,i had mine blocked in madison once thats only 4 hours from where live. it is annoying but if it were stolen it would’nt be annoying anymore!
1085098,red89,2012-07-17 23:00:00,918," I agree with the other guys, I’m glad they do this. I had someone steal my check card number before and was doing test transactions. The bank surprisingly caught it right away and sent me a new card. Much rather they shut it down if something looks suspicious than have thousands of dollars stolen."
1085128,tomr,2012-07-18 01:31:00,1213,On my trip to canada this spring credit card was stopped for Candadian purchases. One phone call and no problems after that. Next time I will call ahead to let them know. Lot of friends have had credit cards stolen and the crooks run up the debt incredibly fast. Have no problem with credit card company being careful.
