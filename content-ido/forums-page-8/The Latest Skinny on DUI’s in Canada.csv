1218479,Chad Thompson,2012-05-28 20:35:00,325,Well – its official. Ontario has relaxed the rules on entering Canada with a DUI. Below is what you NEED to know 1) Having only ONE DUI – you’ll most likely be allowed entry regardless of when it happened. You still may have to pay the $200 fee and apply for “rehabilitation” but they will issue a Temporary Visitor Visa at the border and allow you to enter. This is a big change this year! 2)	Multiple DUI’s (regardless of time) will most likely result in denied entry If you have any questions regarding your specific situation – call me anytime and I can help you navigate the process. I don’t care if your staying at Pasha Lake Cabins or going elsewhere… Or you can call Kevin Begin (Superintendent at Fort Francis) and he can assist you as well. His Ph # is (807) 274-5281

1071812,dr-death,2012-05-28 22:09:00,155,"They’re still holding you up at the border. $200.00!! What a joke. Too many big fish to catch elsewhere to ever think about spending my money north of the border again. I personally have never had a problem, but one of my buddies did three years ago. It was awful;; never again……"
1071823,baldwin4,2012-05-29 00:16:00,736,"So you are saying if I had a DUI 32 years ago when I was 18 years old, that I would have to pay $200.00"
1071831,Joel Nelson,2012-05-29 01:08:00,3123,"Chad: Question for you. Have a friend who had a DUI about 5 years ago. We’ll be fishing a few spots stateside and in Canada where a Remote Area Border Crossing (RABC) permit is required. I’ve got mine taken care of via mail, along with my Ontario license. What are the odds we’ll be able to show up in IFalls or Baudette and get an RABC for him? Joel"
1071870,Chad Thompson,2012-05-29 10:24:00,325,baldwin4 – Nope… any single offense over 10 years old is a non issue… good question!
1071871,Chad Thompson,2012-05-29 10:33:00,325,"Joel – for sure he’ll get a RABC permit, as long as it was just the one DUI. He may have to go through the “Rehabilitation” application, but there is a good chance he won’t. Unfortunately I don’t have a black and white answer for you. This is just based on experience and knowing the system.For people who want to know more about the process… they can go to this web pagehttp://www.cic.gc.ca/english/information/applications/rehabil.asp I have successfully helped several people with this process in the past. I don’t care where people are staying in Canada, if I can help I certainly will."
1071936,big_g,2012-05-29 15:55:00,20604,"This bears repeating… if you have someone that is “more eloquent” in speaking than the others, have them drive through the gate. Answer promptly and concisely. Be personable and they will typically reciprocate  Drive through like you own the place and expect a tussle/hassle"
1072020,Chad Thompson,2012-05-29 20:26:00,325,"Very true and good advice. They may try to rattle your cage, but just remember they are looking for the bad guys who are trying to do bad things. 99.9% of the people crossing the border are great people with nothing to hide and they realize this."
1072055,big_g,2012-05-29 21:43:00,20604,"One night, coming back into the good Ol’ USA, about 3am, I pull up, they ask this that and then where does everybody work… and each to answerfor yourself. I told them where I worked, the other 3 guys told them where they worked, the brother in law was sleeping, they poked him to wake up and asked where he worked, he said “who the hell cares ?”…. then I got “pull into door #2 for search”…..    Now we make sure everyone is alert and awake when coming through  that’s an hour and a half of our life we won’t get back…"
