It was his first time on a Canadian fishing trip, and he’s raring to go back….Yes! another one hooked.  Our first two days were spent relativley close to camp fishing on Marchington, and were slow, largely due to my learning curve. We’d pick up a fish or two here and there, but never got on them hot and heavy. I got my week’s best on a reef, measuring 27.5 inches, 5 minutes into it on day two, but no more fish on that reef that day. Day 3 we decided to boat thru the rock tunnel into Clamshell lake, which is pretty close to being a walleye aquarium. Just a few minutes into it, my son yanks a 20 inch eye as I accidentally drifted into 5 fow on the reef we were fishing. Two hours and 30 boated fish later, we decided to explore more of this lake, which on this day we had all to ourselves. Lots of walleye the rest of the day, but none over 23 inches. We moved out the afternoon to explore more of Marchington. As the week went on, we ventured farther from camp, and found pockets of eyes in most places we were pointed too or tried on our own, with lots of small fish and a few dandies. My son landed the 28 incher shown on a reef in 24 fow, using a 3 inch Gulp minnow, which was the biggest fish of the week.Several 24 to 26 inchers rounded out our bigger fish for the week. Rather than sitting a a spot all day to pull in small fish, we moved around quite a bit to explore the waters. Boated into another adjacent lake one afternoon, and hit numbers of fish on two well marked reefs. Never did any of the portages into over a dozen other lakes that offered fast walleye fishing, but did go into Clamshell one more time for the tunnel experience and fast action. Worked a weed bed at the south end for rumored 13 inch perch, only to yank some 18 to 20 inch walleye on small twister jigs, in open spots around the cabbage. Boated a couple blue walleye in this area.We spent some time targeting pike by casting plastics and spoons into the weeded bays, but only got snakes, biggest at 24 inches. Lost a number of bigger fish to bite-offs while jigging, but the big ones always seem to get away. Two pike in the low 40’s were boated in camp the week we were there. No smallie action to speak of, and we were told that they are very difficult to come by. We got one,incidental to eye fishing. Overall, I would rate the walleye fishing in Marchington as good, with big fish potential. Clamshell was excellent, and the adjacent Rock lake reportedly better than Clamshell, as far as size and number. But we were more than satisfied exploring Marchington, and venturing into Clamshell and Stanzikimi for a change of pace. I must add that the accomodations were some of the best I’ve seen in my Canadian trips. Fully equipped, running water, electricity, and roomy, great for cooking those walleye dinners each night. Camp owners, Tena and Darrell, were super, and the dock hands/fish advisors were always there to offer help and point you in the right direction when you wanted to venture out. Boats were always clean and dry in the morning, with a full tank of gas, ready for another day exploring. And you never know who you’re gonna run into at camp. If you’re looking for a father/child trip, the rates can’t be beat. Check out their website for the lowdown on costs. Low rates, fast action, big fish, scenic surroundings, and great staff make for a combination that’s tough to beat. Despite being rained on for 6 out of 7 days we were there, my son’s already asking about when we’re going back."

794384,diesel,2009-07-30 19:32:00,1020,Sounds like a great time Z-Man. So when is you son/the expert going to get a call sign and start teaching me on the finer points of walleye fishing since he bested his dad. Looking forward to my trips in a couple years. D
794394,z-man,2009-07-30 19:50:00,1364,"We crossed the border both ways on Monday, and were the only ones at the gates. Passports did the trick, with the typical “where ya from, where you going, how long, any firearms, any fish, tobacco, beer…..”, etc. questions. A breeze."
794399,z-man,2009-07-30 19:55:00,1364,"Diesel, you ought to know that even a blind squirrel finds an acorn now and then.  Actually, it was funny, because not longer than 5 minutes after we released the 28 incher, he was looking to out-do the 30 incher I have on the wall from my first Canadian trip 15 years ago, and was fully expecting to do so. I had mixed feelings, because he asked if we’d get it mounted if he beat 30 inches …seeing big dollar signs flash in my mind, I had fleeting thoughts about rooting against him, but resisted."
794832,bola,2009-08-02 13:13:00,77,Good to see you guys had a safe and fun trip
795198,walleye_wisdom,2009-08-04 05:06:00,1160,"That is a fun resort. I’ve been there 3 times, met Gary Roach also one of the times. Always had a great time fishing there. Next time make the portage to Singapore Lake, REALLY worth it. Big pike and big Walleye. I keep trying to get to Zarn for some Lake Trout!"
795232,big_g,2009-08-04 14:16:00,20604,Fished Zarn about 10 years ago… ALOT of fun big G
795242,z-man,2009-08-04 15:08:00,1364,"Even with 7 days, we simply didn’t have the time to hit them all. Spent a lot of time exploring marchington, mostly to the east. Being my son’s first Canadian fishing trip, I tried to hit areas that had good numbers, and Clamshell and Stansikimi paid off. But we do plan to go back, and being more familiar with the lay of the land, we’ll certainly trek into Rock and Singapore and probably Zarn. Hopefully have some better weather next trip…..the intermittent rain storms had us gun-shy by the end of the week. Did you guys target lakers in Zarn?? Don said they’re deep this time of year."
795327,big_g,2009-08-04 18:22:00,20604,"Yes we did. We spent 5 days on Dominion and came out a day early, because a group from Nebraska got in a day early…  We stayed at the Lodge in Zarn and hit the lake the next day. We fished anywhere from 70-90 FOW… we caught about 20  Funny thing was, I caught a 5 lb northern at them depths big G"
