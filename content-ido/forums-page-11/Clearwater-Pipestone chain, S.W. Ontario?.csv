I am looking for some help to learn this fast and the potential this chain may have for a Father-Son Ministry trip for next summer. I am heading up with my boat, 16′ Sylvan backtroller (tentatively alone at this point). Send me a message, Thanks Carroll"

By the end of the second trip we were boating a number of nice fish with some in the 4-5 lb. range. I would recommend you connect with a good resort up there that can give you some updated info. on the bite. Best of luck! We stayed at True North resort if you are still searching for a place to stay. Accomodations were nice, but they didn’t really provide a ton of fishing info."
798157,joeyno5,2009-08-18 12:37:00,486,"Awesome multi species lake. Walleye, Muskie, Smallies, Lakers, and Pike. If you are looking for a place to stay I would suggest Hideaway Lodge, Doug and Cathy are excellent host and they have an outpost availble if you want more seclusion. Alot of water to fish, so if your looking to learn this area , “Fast” then good luck cause that probably ain’t gonna happen but you will enjoy your time on the Pipe and learn a little something everytime you go back."

Thursday, Saturday & Sunday evenings we fished right on Clearwater catching and of finishing off our limits Walleye’s although most were 13″-15″ along with numerous Orange Crayfish. Friday we fished East Jackfish midmorning had our limits of 17-18 Eye’s in 15 minutes. Sunday we went North thru Pipestone and caught 2-eye’s but then tied into numerous smallies that came blasting out of the shaded & rocky shorelines to hit a small rapala stick. The Eye’s mainly all came on jig and minnow in 15-25′"
