817985,James Holst,2009-11-23 23:46:00,18922, What species would you prefer to target? I assume walleyes but figured I’d better ask just in case.
817989,James Holst,2009-11-24 00:06:00,18922,"If walleyes are your game I would recommend Pasha Lake Cabins. We were up there this summer and the walleye fishing is fantastic and I would recommend them in a heartbeat. If you go, be sure to fish Lake Onaman. http://www.idofishing.com/forum/showflat.php?Cat=0&Board=reports&Number=798559 Unlike most canadian lakes Onaman kicks out BIG eyes. And in some eye popping numbers. If you read through the report I linked you’ll see what I mean. I know Onaman kicks out some true tankers up to 31″ as well. Maybe Chad Thompson, owner of Pasha Lake Cabins, will spot this and throw up some pics from this past summer. I know the groups out of his resort boated some big fish and the good bite lasted well into the late summer. http://www.pashalake.com"
818006,tstatz,2009-11-24 01:01:00,188,Thanks James!we are a walleye group but a little smallmouth action would be good.
818028,Chad Thompson,2009-11-24 03:12:00,325,"Hi Tom. Its Chad from Pasha. If you would like, I can call you to discuss some options. If we are a good fit for you great. If not I should be able to point you in the right direction. I am a little limited on communication so if you could email me [email protected] I can call you"
