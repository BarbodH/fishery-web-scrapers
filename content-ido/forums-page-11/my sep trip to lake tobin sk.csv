After a short nap , we hit the water with a 13 mile run, perfect conditions with light wind we hit the first spot 3-5 fow coontail and spotty cabbage this spot played out for great pike fishing. For the next 2 days we put the hurt on the nice gators. Lots of fish in the upper 30s with a few in the low 40s and one at 46″ ,and 45″. Burning small to mediun buck tails in green, yellow,and orange. The fish that were committing were very heathly and lots of power to peel drag. On days 3&4 we ran in the other direction 10 miles to the first stop; shallow flat with a steep break to deep water. Lots of sparse green cabbage. Again with the pike in upper 30s and low 40s and one at 46 ,45.5,&44.”Same small lures did the trick. Fishing cooled down mid day so we tried our hand in trolling some cranks at the break and out side the break with very good success with more fish in the 30s and 40s. All the pike were very healthy and in great shape. All I can say is what a great pike fishery. For days 5&6 we tried for some walleye, tried lots of cranks but not so much success, only a few eaters. So out came the crawler harness, after loosing way more than I can count we finally got one with size, 26.7. Felt like I was reeling in a cement block hardly any fight, but still fun. Lost a few more but that’s the way it goes. On the last 3 days we were there, we had a few fronts move through and the fishing got tough but we gave it our best. All in all it was a 9 out of 10. I’m ready to go back up there next year with a new game plan for the walleye. Thinking about a ice fishing trip in the winter."

806245,sliderfishn,2009-09-24 13:42:00,5428," I was there in 95,96, and 97, each time we were there is when the Provincial record was broken. Tobin is truly an amazing fishery.Thanks for sharing your pic and story, it makes me want to go back. Great looking fish"
806255,Calvin Svihel,2009-09-24 14:03:00,3862,"I went to Tobin in 2006 just for walleyes. We had some very tough fishing but the size made up for lack of fish. These fish are absolutley thick and huge. My avatar is from Tobin. We fished the river mainly, not the lake. If you fellas are interested in some sick walleyes weights check out the Vanity Cup results… That will explain the potential of lake tobin. 2008 Vanity Cup results"
