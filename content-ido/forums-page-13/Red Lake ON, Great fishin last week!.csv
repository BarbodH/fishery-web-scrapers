There was barely a slow moment the entire week, and only once did we stop the boat and not catch an ‘eye. Plenty of eaters and many nice fish over 25″. The big one for the week was 29 1/4″. Definitely didn’t need to worry about sun block, it was rainy and about 50 degrees every day, made for a nice fishin trip, can’t wait to get back up next year! Most of the success was on lindy or spinner rigs, but this year I added drop-shotting to the lineup and really hammered em good!"
