1218341,Labvolt,2008-08-22 14:51:00,30,"Three of us headed to Kenora on Sunday, August 17. We fished until Wednesday, August 20. Stayed at Anicinabe campground. Arrived Sunday night at 6:30PM, on the water by 7PM. Drove out around Manitou Is…hit a small reef and had 6 eaters in the box by 7:45PM. Released a couple more and had a late fish fry at 9PM. Monday and Tuesday were both similar days: South-east wind, cool AM, warm day, suicidal walleyes. Pick a reef, any reef and they were there from 16-45 f.o.w. We counted “boated fish” after shore lunch. In 1 hour we landed 31 walleye. Fished bottom-bouncers with 2-hook spinners with 1/2 a crawler. Places we tried: Manitou Is, Lemon Is, Devli’s Elbow, Oliver Is and reefs South and East of the Is. Wednesday had stronger wind but still good fishing. Ate shore lunch and brought a few eaters home. Biggest fish was 24″, but the action gave you a biceps workout. I tried to attach a few picts.A return trip is already planned."
